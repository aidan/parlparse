<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2502</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Bannockburn Battlefield</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament observes the importance of the Battle of Bannockburn in Scottish history, where Robert the Bruce led a significant Scottish victory against the English in the Wars of Scottish Independence in June 1314; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s historic battlefields are important to Scottish history and that the sites must be protected as a memorial to the men who fought and died in the battles as well as allowing future generations to visit the sites and learn more about Scotland&rsquo;s past; notes the concerns of the National Trust for Scotland that the Bannockburn battlefield may fail to qualify for Historic Scotland&rsquo;s planned inventory of battlefields as too much housing has already been allowed on and around the historic site, and considers that the battlefield site has already been subject to enough development and that it now requires protection to stop any future development.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2501</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Tragedy, Loss, Hope, Help, Rescue and Survival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the excellent work of Scotland&rsquo;s firefighters, as detailed in research published by the Fire Brigades Union showing that 141 people per month are rescued from fires and vehicle crashes by fire crew, that 4,181 people were rescued from dwelling fires between 2001 and 2005 and that 4,280 people involved in road traffic collisions were rescued in the five years to 2005-06, the most recent year for which figures are available, and thanks our firefighters for their efforts to preserve lives across Scotland and bring hope, help, rescue and survival where there is tragedy and loss.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2500</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to WRVS Renfrewshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the WRVS in Renfrewshire on the opening of its new information centre and cafe in Paisley; considers that WRVS chose to launch this major new way of delivering on its charitable purposes in Paisley and in Scotland because it wanted to launch in a place with the energy and initiative to make its vision come to life; also considers that the centre&rsquo;s model of sustainable social enterprise, founded on partnership working with both local voluntary and statutory organisations in the Reaching Older Adults in Renfrewshire (ROAR) initiative and Renfrewshire Council, is a positive one designed for success; recognises that older people in particular and the people of the communities of Paisley and Renfrewshire as a whole will now be able to enjoy and benefit from a first-class facility that simultaneously serves a social and a recreational purpose, and hopes that such positive approaches to meeting social challenges, involving partners from the voluntary, public and, indeed, private sectors flourish in future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2499</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>World Suicide Prevention Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 35 years of age and that each death is a tragedy which affects family members and friends; welcomes the progress of Choose Life within NHS Health Scotland in helping reduce Scotland&rsquo;s suicide rate by 13% since 2002; supports the launch of the Don&rsquo;t Hide it.

<p><strong>S3M-2490</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>SIGN Guideline on Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Surgery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the updated SIGN guideline 104 on antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery as making a significant contribution to the containment of hospital-associated infections and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure the effective implementation of these guidelines as a matter of priority.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2489</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Forth Valley Practitioners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates general practitioners in Forth Valley on achieving an 86% take-up of the new General Medical Services contract, extending the hours during which appointments are available to patients, but notes that, while there is an average take-up of around 51% across Scotland, there is a huge variation between NHS boards, even between those boards with similar demographics and geography; therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to take all necessary steps, working with territorial NHS boards, to ensure equity of access for all patients in Scotland, and further calls on the Executive to monitor the way in which these extra hours are being utilised.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2468</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Action on Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the programme of post office closures initiated by the UK Labour government; notes that UK Government figures predict an overall annual shortfall across the United Kingdom of just &pound;200 million; recognises that only 1,638 of the 14,300 UK post offices are in Scotland and that, of those Scottish post offices, 258 are currently threatened; believes that post offices offer a vital public service in communities throughout Scotland that should be preserved, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to take immediate action by writing to the UK Government offering to fund the financial shortfall in Scotland in exchange for a commitment that no further Scottish post offices will be closed.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2465</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Class Sizes in West Dunbartonshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the study carried out by SNP-led West Dunbartonshire Council that has demonstrated that the SNP promise of reducing primary class sizes to 18 is undeliverable in the lifetime of this parliament in the absence of adequate funding; agrees with the statements by civil servants that &quot;the scale of the commitment does not allow it to be delivered in the lifetime of a parliament&quot; and &quot;the commitment will take 8-10 years to achieve&quot;; recognises that an extra &pound;7 million would be required to deliver this pledge in the West Dunbartonshire area alone; considers with disappointment that the SNP has misled voters with yet another broken promise, and calls on the Scottish Government to produce a report detailing the exact costs of honouring this commitment, including the cost of extra teachers and classrooms for each local authority, how these costs will be met and a realistic timescale in which the reduction in class sizes will be achieved.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2462</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Emergency Services at the Vale of Leven Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deeply regrets the conclusions of <em>Report of the independent external clinical review of anaesthetic services at the Vale of Leven Hospital</em>, which recommends the removal of the anaesthetics service at the hospital and the cessation of the Medical Assessment Unit in its current form; notes the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing&rsquo;s welcome for the report which, if implemented, will see the further transfer of patients from the Vale of Leven Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; further notes that the report recommends that all attendances resulting from 999 calls and NHS24 referrals will completely bypass the Vale of Leven Hospital and only attendances referred by a GP and the Minor Injuries Unit will continue; recognises that the net effect of these changes is expected to result in as many as 64% of existing emergency patients being transferred away from the Vale of Leven to Paisley; consequently believes that the SNP government will have failed to meet its own policy of keeping services local if existing patients are unable to receive emergency medical care at the Vale of Leven Hospital; is further disappointed that the option to develop a new acute hospital north of the Clyde, centred on the Golden Jubilee Hospital, has not been comprehensively considered, despite the excellence of the clinical quality that would be provided, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government, in the strongest possible terms, to continue existing emergency services at the Vale of Leven Hospital and give robust consideration to realigning acute services for the local population, away from Paisley to north of the river.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2456.1</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of the Comments of Andrew Lansley and Defence of the NHS in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2456) in the name of Margaret Curran, leave out from first &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;is wearying of the parade of invitations to pay tribute to the former Lib/Lab administration, rejected by the electorate in May 2007; invites the Scottish Government to press on with evidence-based action to assist the people of Scotland to tackle health inequalities and to do so without fear or favour to the record of the Labour party, which having governed the people of Glasgow for decades has singularly failed to improve health inequalities within the city, and calls on members of all parties to measure success less by reference to health spending and more by reference to health outcomes while ensuring that all people in Scotland, of whatever financial means, can access the healthcare they deserve.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2232#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Shortage of Indian Chefs in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that there is a shortage of Indian chefs in Aberdeen and elsewhere in Scotland and that the popularity of Indian food remains high, reflecting well on the appreciation of cultural diversity in our country; further notes the success of the Fresh Talent initiative in retaining overseas graduates, and commends consideration of a similar pilot scheme for Indian chefs in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1839#</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Family Law Disputes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that current arrangements for settling family law disputes could be improved and that current law still discriminates against parents who are not married; notes that parents can find it difficult or impossible to enforce contact orders where the other parent is unco-operative and that disputes where broken families live in more than one jurisdiction within the United Kingdom are unnecessarily difficult to resolve; further notes that these issues are particularly relevant due to recent cases in the north east; encourages current moves by Scotland&rsquo;s legal profession towards collaborative dispute resolution, and notes with interest the new system of less adversarial trials being developed in Australia.</p>
