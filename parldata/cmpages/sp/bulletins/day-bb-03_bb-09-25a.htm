            that a step towards restoring such confidence would be to introduce 
            honesty in sentencing by re-enacting sections 33 to 41 of the Crime 
            and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997, which were repealed by section 
            108 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998; notes that public confidence 
            has been further undermined by the lack of visible policing in too 
            many communities, and calls on the Scottish Executive to consider 
            how accountability to the public in the delivery of police services

                National Theatre</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-406)

                to end and insert &quot;recognises that this is the culmination 
                of a sixty-year campaign for a National Theatre Company; regrets 
                the Executive&#146;s past failure to deliver on its promises despite 
                repeated underspends in its budget, and hopes that this commissioning 
                body will produce theatre of such excellence and quality that 
                theatre-going audiences will be captivated and enlarged in Scotland 
                and that it will bring greater understanding of theatre to all 
                corners of Scotland, provide inspiration and opportunity for actors, 
                writers, designers and production staff to showcase their talents 
                and provide greater cultural entertainment and enjoyment for present 
                and future generations of local inhabitants and visitors.&quot;

              <p> <strong>S2M-406.1</strong> <strong>Colin Fox: Scottish National 
                Theatre</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-406) in the

                to end and insert &quot;believes that the success of this radical 
                concept of a commissioning theatre presenting theatrical and writing 
                excellence to all the people of Scotland and the world will in 
                part be measured by greater involvement in the theatre and access 
                to productions by the people of Scotland both regionally and locally.&quot;

          <p><strong>S2M-210</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Respect 
            for Shopworkers Day, 17 September 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the level of violence and abuse that shopworkers 
            deal with on a daily basis; further notes the recent survey by the 
            Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied workers (USDAW) that found 
            that 47% of those responding to the survey reported physical attacks 
            or assaults on staff in the last 12 months, that 72% reported staff 
            being threatened with violence, that in one in four stores threats 
            are being made every week, that in one-third of stores verbal abuse 
            is a daily event, that almost 50% of staff have taken time off work 
            as a result of violence and that stress-related problems are common 
            and include sickness, insomnia, headaches and clinical depression; 
            commends the USDAW campaign, &quot;Freedom from Fear&quot;&#146; and 
            recognises its main objectives as raising awareness of the level of 
            violence and abuse, making the workplace safer and protecting both 
            shoppers and staff, and supports &quot;Respect for Shopworkers Day&quot; 
            on 17 September 2003 aimed at preventing abusive behaviour, highlighting 
            the support that retail companies can, and do, give their staff and 
            encouraging the public to show respect for shopworkers.</p>
