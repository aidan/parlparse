<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2471</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Dementia Research Network for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the formal opening of the Dementia Research Network for Scotland on Friday 29 August 2008; agrees that the network will play a significant role in bringing together Scotland&rsquo;s leading academic and clinical experts conducting research into dementia and potential treatments; notes that the network will also collaborate with similar networks across the United Kingdom; further notes that the research hubs will be positioned across Scotland in order to allow participating patients easer access to facilities; recognises its creation as part of the wider campaign to ensure that Scotland is prepared for a large increase in the number of people with dementia in the next two decades, and looks forward to its findings in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2470</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>UNFPA and the Health Crisis in Georgia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that, while significant international attention has been focussed on the possible consequences of the conflict between Russia and Georgia, there has been less attention paid to the wellbeing of the 130,000 or more people who have been displaced as a result of the hostilities; notes in particular that this figure includes around 30,000 women of reproductive age of whom 2,000 to 3,000 are estimated to be pregnant and without access to health infrastructure; notes that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has been providing emergency obstetric care, counselling and dignity kits that include basic items for sanitation but that the fund estimates that an additional $600,000 is needed to provide reproductive health services to internally displaced people in the short term, and calls on the UK Government to work with the UNFPA to ensure that these and other essential needs are met as quickly as possible for the many innocent people caught up in a conflict that is not of their making.</p>
<p align="justify">Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Keith Brown<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2469</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>SNP Councillor Glamorises Guns</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern about the growing problem of gun crime in Scotland and condemns the actions of SNP councillor, Jahangir Hanif, in posing with an AK-47 rifle; considers that any action by an elected representative that glamorises gun crime is completely unacceptable and that Councillor Hanif&rsquo;s action dangerously undermines the credibility of the SNP government on law and order; condemns the SNP&rsquo;s response as totally inadequate, and notes that the final judgement on both Councillor Hanif and the SNP will rest with the electorate.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2468</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Action on Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the programme of post office closures initiated by the UK Labour government; notes that UK Government figures predict an overall annual shortfall across the United Kingdom of just &pound;200 million; recognises that only 1,638 of the 14,300 UK post offices are in Scotland and that, of those Scottish post offices, 258 are currently threatened; believes that post offices offer a vital public service in communities throughout Scotland that should be preserved, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to take immediate action by writing to the UK Government offering to fund the financial shortfall in Scotland in exchange for a commitment that no further Scottish post offices will be closed.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2467</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Auchengeich Colliery Disaster</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 50th anniversary of the Auchengeich Colliery Disaster which claimed the lives of 47 miners on 18 September 1959; recognises that the tragedy not only directly affected the 41 widows and 76 children left fatherless but also impacted on all of the people of Chryston and surrounding communities; appreciates that this devastating event continues to be significant to the people of the area; commends the local community for the dignity and respect that it has shown to the memory of the victims and their families during commemorative events held annually at the disaster memorial; considers that such events play an important role in ensuring that those who die as a result of work are not forgotten; commends the trade unions for their work in building trade union organisation and campaigning for stricter enforcement with higher penalties for breaches of health and safety laws to help in the struggle for safer workplaces, and supports the call for recognition of International Workers Memorial Day as a national day of remembrance for those who have been killed, injured or made ill by their work.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2466</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Report into International Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the European and External Relations Committee&rsquo;s 3rd Report, 2008 (Session 3): Inquiry into International Development (SP Paper 134).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2465</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Class Sizes in West Dunbartonshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the study carried out by SNP-led West Dunbartonshire Council that has demonstrated that the SNP promise of reducing primary class sizes to 18 is undeliverable in the lifetime of this parliament in the absence of adequate funding; agrees with the statements by civil servants that &quot;the scale of the commitment does not allow it to be delivered in the lifetime of a parliament&quot; and &quot;the commitment will take 8-10 years to achieve&quot;; recognises that an extra &pound;7 million would be required to deliver this pledge in the West Dunbartonshire area alone; considers with disappointment that the SNP has misled voters with yet another broken promise, and calls on the Scottish Government to produce a report detailing the exact costs of honouring this commitment, including the cost of extra teachers and classrooms for each local authority, how these costs will be met and a realistic timescale in which the reduction in class sizes will be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2464</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Zoom Airline Collapses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commiserates with the plight of all those who have suffered as a result of the collapse of Zoom Airlines, an example of whom would be Flying Fiddles, a group of outstanding young musicians from the Western Isles which has lost out on around &pound;7,000 worth of flights for its forthcoming tour of Canada, money which was largely raised from within its own community, and calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to protect travellers from airlines which seem more than willing to take bookings from passengers in the apparently full knowledge that their companies are in profound financial difficulties.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2463</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>The Education (Means Testing) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Education (Means Testing) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2008 (SSI 2008/206).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2462</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Emergency Services at the Vale of Leven Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deeply regrets the conclusions of <em>Report of the independent external clinical review of anaesthetic services at the Vale of Leven Hospital</em>, which recommends the removal of the anaesthetics service at the hospital and the cessation of the Medical Assessment Unit in its current form; notes the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing&rsquo;s welcome for the report which, if implemented, will see the further transfer of patients from the Vale of Leven Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; further notes that the report recommends that all attendances resulting from 999 calls and NHS24 referrals will completely bypass the Vale of Leven Hospital and only attendances referred by a GP and the Minor Injuries Unit will continue; recognises that the net effect of these changes is expected to result in as many as 64% of existing emergency patients being transferred away from the Vale of Leven to Paisley; consequently believes that the SNP government will have failed to meet its own policy of keeping services local if existing patients are unable to receive emergency medical care at the Vale of Leven Hospital; is further disappointed that the option to develop a new acute hospital north of the Clyde, centred on the Golden Jubilee Hospital, has not been comprehensively considered, despite the excellence of the clinical quality that would be provided, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government, in the strongest possible terms, to continue existing emergency services at the Vale of Leven Hospital and give robust consideration to realigning acute services for the local population, away from Paisley to north of the river.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2461</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Fuel Poverty and the SWIFT Warm Winter Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the efforts of Renewable Devices SWIFT Turbines Ltd to combat fuel poverty in Scotland through its SWIFT Warm Winter Challenge whereby it has offered to donate its annual profits this year to alleviate fuel poverty in a joint initiative with Energy Action Scotland; encourages the business community to take up the challenge and fund the installation of 250 SWIFT wind turbines in fuel-poor homes in Scotland; recognises the value in the installation of the SWIFT Rooftop Wind Energy System, which will have a long-term cost saving for households in fuel poverty as well as providing a green source of energy and reducing our carbon footprint, and notes that, in the wake of the announcement of the closure of the Vestas wind turbine factory in Scotland, this challenge not only supports our fuel poor, but will also demonstrate Scotland&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to renewable energy.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2460</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Scottish Schools Word Debating Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the commencement of the World Schools Debating Championships in Washington, D.C., United States of America, between 5 and 15 September 2008; sends its very best wishes to the Scottish team of Joanna Farmer, Lauren Pringle, Natalie Smith, Rachel Watson and Sandy Jackson; notes that Scotland is the defending champion, and is sure that team members will do their schools, coaches, the nation and, most importantly, themselves proud.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2459</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Douglas Parish Chimes Again</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the restoration of Scotland&rsquo;s oldest-known working clock after major restoration to the bell tower of the 14th century church of St Bride&rsquo;s in Douglas, Lanarkshire; notes that this ancient timepiece dates back to 1565 and is rumoured to have been a gift to the village of Douglas from Mary, Queen of Scots; commends Historic Scotland and long-established Edinburgh clockmakers, James Ritchie and Son, for making this restoration possible, and finally recognises the value and benefit that this restoration represents to the people of Douglas.</p>
