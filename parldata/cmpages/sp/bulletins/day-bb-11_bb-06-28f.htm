<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00431 Bob Doris: Young Player Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the winners of the North Glasgow Football Development Group&rsquo;s (NGFDG) 2011 Young Player Awards, Robbie McPhee, Francis Gallagher, Kyle Sloss, Kieran Marshall, Calvin O&rsquo;Brien, Jay Findlay, Reegan Shearer, Louis Fisher, Dylan Shannon and Aiden Laurie, and recognises what it considers the enormous contribution of NGFDG volunteers over the past year in encouraging these youngsters to take pride in their sporting endeavours.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00430 James Dornan: Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the Scottish Football Museum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 10th anniversary of the Scottish Football Museum at Hampden Park; notes that the Scottish Football Museum exists to promote the unique football heritage of Scotland, to build and maintain a national football collection and to educate and inspire future generations; considers the museum to be a valuable national asset in the ambition to challenge sectarianism across Scotland; congratulates all the staff at the museum over the years who have contributed to its success, and encourages as many people as possible to visit the museum on 9 or 10 July 2011 and to take up its special anniversary offer of a 5p entry.</p>
