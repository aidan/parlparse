                be), unless by prior agreement.</font></i></strong></p>
              <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">5. What follows is guidance on how 
                those principles should be applied in practice.</font></p>

          <p><strong><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dealing with individual constituents' 
            cases</font></strong></p>
          <dir> 
            <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">6.&#9;The basic principle 
              is that the wishes of the constituent are paramount. In particular, 
              a constituent has the right to approach his or her constituency 
              MSP, or any of the seven regional MSPs elected in his or her region. 
              They also have the right to expect an MSP to take on a case though 
              the MSP must be able to judge how best to do so. It is expected, 
              however, that, in practice, the usual point of contact for a constituent 
              raising a specific personal or local matter will be his or her constituency 
              MSP. In the event that a regional ('list') MSP does raise a constituency 
              case (for example with a Minister or local authority) he or she 
              must notify the relevant constituency MSP at the outset unless the 
              consent of the constituent is withheld. A suggested pro-forma for 
              this purpose is attached at Appendix A.</font></p>
            <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">7.&#9;Ministers or agencies 
              such as local authorities and health boards, who are in correspondence 
              with MSPs on such constituency issues, should <u>not</u> notify 
              other MSPs representing the area. That would breach the confidential 
              nature of the relationship between constituent and MSP. The only 
              exception is where constituency cases raise more general issues 
              of relevance to the whole constituency or area. In those circumstances, 
              a Minister or agency may judge it appropriate to notify other MSPs 
              with an interest of the general issue. They should not, however, 
              refer to, or identify, individual constituents in doing so. Staff 
              working on behalf of Ministers or agencies should be made aware 
              of and apply these guidelines.</font></p>

              elected. The Minister would be expected only to reply to the MSP 
              raising the matter. It is for that MSP to notify others, taking 
              into account, of course, the views of the constituent as in paragraph&nbsp;6

              It is recognised that this might involve such agencies (NDPBs, local 
              authorities, health boards etc) in dealing with potentially large 
              numbers of MSPs, in particular, where agency boundaries cross regional 
              boundaries. The expectation therefore is that the constituency Member 
              or Members will be involved as a matter of course and that agencies 
              will make appropriate arrangements to maintain contact and consult 
              with regional list MSPs which have relevant regional representation 
              perhaps through a representative regional list MSP nominated by 
              each party. Agencies are free to inform or consult these nominated 
              members either jointly with constituency members, or seperately. 
              This does not affect the right of any Member representing a constituency

              aware that, once elected, they represent all the people living in 
              their constituency or region. For that reason members are strongly 
              discouraged from identifying party affiliation on stationery and 
              other items provided out of public funds including Parliament headed

            <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17. It follows from the 
              first and second principles and from what is said above that regional 
              Members have responsibility to <u>all</u> those in the region for 
              which they were elected. It is important therefore that they recognise 
              this in the way in which they operate within the region. This is 
              an issue of fundamental importance in the relationship between constituency 
              and regional Members. The following is of critical relevance in 
              dealing with any complaints regarding these matters. Regional Members 
              are expected to work in more than 2 constituencies within their 
              region. Evidence that they were doing so would include holding surgeries 
              in more than 2 constituencies (though regional<strong> </strong>Members do 
              have the option of holding surgeries in their Party's<strong> </strong>regional 
              office <u>only</u>) and dealing with local authorities and other 
              agencies and constituents in more than 2 constituencies within their 
              region. Regional Members would also, of course, be expected to deal 
              (as appropriate) with any matter raised by any constituent within 
              their region.</font></p>

              for them) in respect of this guidance should in the first instance 
              be made to the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer will, as 
              appropriate, contact the Member or Members involved and, if necessary, 
              their respective Party Business Managers. Where the matter cannot 
              be resolved informally in this way, where the matter is of sufficient 
              seriousness to warrant a more formal investigation, or where any 
              MSP directly involved remains dissatisfied the Presiding Officer 
              will raise the matter with the Convener of the Standards Committee. 
              The Standards Committee would then consider the matter as it judges 
              appropriate in accordance with its procedures and its remit to consider 
              and report on the conduct of members in carrying out their Parliamentary 
              duties. It is fundamental to the success of this document that the 
              Standards Committee will as a matter of course, treat all breaches 
              of these principles with the utmost seriousness. Members should 
              note that raising matters in any way other than that described above 
              (in particular via the media) may well prejudice their case.</font></p>
