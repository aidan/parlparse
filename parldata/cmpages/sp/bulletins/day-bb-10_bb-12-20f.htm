<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <p></p>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7628 Cathy Peattie: Snow Party</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the residents of Canal Walk, Brightons, Falkirk who, following heavy snow, organised a &quot;snow party&quot;, which was attended by 30 people armed with spades, shovels and home baking who spent an hour clearing the street of snow; believes that this and similar instances of locally organised action to keep streets and pavements clear of snow and ice are great examples of Scotland&rsquo;s communities at their best, organising themselves to tackle adversity for the benefit of the community as a whole, and believes that such initiatives should be supported and encouraged by local authorities and the Scottish Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7627 Pauline McNeill: Congratulations to Fair Isle Crafts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Fair Isle Crafts Ltd on the success of its Fair Isle jumpers; recognises that these jumpers have achieved worldwide success and that order books are full for the next six months; acknowledges the talent of the six people who currently make the jumpers; further acknowledges the contribution that they have made to the Scottish fashion industry, and recognises what it considers to be the increased success of the Scottish fashion industry worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7626 Karen Whitefield: Congratulations to Airdrie Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Airdrie Academy on the annual school league tables recording what it considers to be an excellent performance by it over the past year; notes that the percentage of pupils awarded five or more Highers at grades A to C has doubled in the past year from 5 to 10%; further notes that almost a quarter of the relevant pupils achieved three or more Highers and that 40% gained at least one; considers that this constitutes an outstanding level of improvement and stands testament to the diligence and commitment of staff and pupils alike; fully expects that Airdrie Academy will continue to flourish over the coming year, and wishes everyone at the school every success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7625 Patrick Harvie: Postal Services Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its strong support to the Communication Workers Union in its protest against the UK Government&rsquo;s planned Postal Services Bill, which would privatise approximately 90% of Royal Mail; agrees with the Communication Workers Union that this legislation would mean the end of a trusted and vital public institution, that there would be unacceptable price increases and that it would lead to the closure of yet more essential community post offices, and calls on the UK Government to learn what are seen as the lessons of failed privatisation drives of the past, such as the UK rail network, and to properly prioritise and fully fund Royal Mail and the Post Office as a national public service of the first order.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7624 Ken Macintosh: Top Marks for Williamwood</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Williamwood High School in East Renfrewshire on its recognition as the best performing secondary school in Scotland for the second year running; applauds the efforts of pupils, parents and staff in maintaining the highest standards at the school; pays particular tribute to the attainment levels of Williamwood pupils including what is considered the remarkable achievement of 46% achieving five or more Highers this year, and admires what it considers to be the hard work and enthusiasm, the quality of teaching, the good leadership, the support of the local authority and the involvement of parents and the wider community, all of which goes in to making Williamwood the success that it is.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7623 Christine Grahame: Halt the Attack on WikiLeaks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns what it considers the assault on free speech by the US Government and other nation states in undermining the international new media website, WikiLeaks; understands that recent additional disclosures provide evidence that the US Government planned in February 2008 to &quot;damage and destroy&quot; WikiLeaks; deplores what it considers to be the overtly politically motivated efforts of the US and other governments in undermining WikiLeaks; believes that among the disclosures made by this groundbreaking website is evidence of war crimes and human rights abuses by the US and other governments, and urges all countries to resist any threats or diplomatic intimidation by the US and recognise that WikiLeaks has an important role in ensuring genuinely open, transparent and accountable government.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7622 Christine Grahame: Remove the BBC Weather Tilt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament renews calls on the BBC to remove the distorted tilt to the BBC television weather map; believes that this results in poorer detail for viewers in Scotland and gives a warped visual representation that implies that England is geographically bigger than it actually is; considers that, in the current adverse weather, it is vital for viewers in Scotland in particular to secure accurate and detailed weather forecast information and that the current tilt is reducing the amount of information that viewers in Scotland are getting, and therefore calls on the BBC to reinstate the vertical aerial map of the UK.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7621 Tavish Scott: Lerwick and Stornoway Coastguard Stations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, together, the Lerwick and Stornoway coastguard stations cover very large and complex areas of sea and coastline consisting of the Northern and Western Isles, the Pentland Firth, the Minch, the West Highland coast and lochs, and large areas of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea including key deepwater oil fields; believes that the service that they offer to seafarers is greatly enhanced by the local knowledge that the coastguard officers in each station have of the seas, tides and coastlines in their area; fears that such knowledge would be dangerously diluted were one of the stations to close leaving the other to cover the combined area, and believes that members should resolutely oppose any plans to close the Lerwick and Stornoway coastguard stations.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7620 Kenneth Gibson: Employment Codes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is opposed to the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals to scrap the code of practice on workforce matters, which protects workers on outsourced public sector contracts from having different pay and conditions to colleagues working alongside them; believes that the abolition of this code of practice will create a two-tier workforce and will impact heavily on lower-paid workers, particularly in cleaning and catering services; considers that this is a regressive step that will signal to unscrupulous contractors that it is acceptable to pay employees the bare minimum and will, it believes, result in a so-called race to the bottom as some contractors competing for business cut employee wages, and believes that the UK Government should follow the lead of the Scottish Government, which has announced a living wage for employees over which it has responsibility.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7619*#* Alasdair Allan: Coastguard Centre Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the public consultation document launched by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency that envisages what are believed to be drastic reductions in the number of maritime operations centres in the United Kingdom; notes that the proposed reductions would leave only two 24-hour centres operating, based in Aberdeen and in Southampton/Portsmouth; further notes that these would be supported by seven sub-centres and only one would be in Scotland at either Shetland or Stornoway; notes that this would result in the five operations centres in Scotland being reduced to two; believes that this raises serious questions about the future operation of the coastguard given that centres will now be covering what it considers to be such huge areas and that this has clear implications for many members of staff, *and believes that these proposals require to be rethought.*</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7618 Willie Coffey: Hey, I&rsquo;m Alive, a True Story by Louise Hunter</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, further to motion S2M-3334, commends the continuing efforts of the West of Scotland Branch of Ataxia UK in supporting people affected by Ataxia, including people with the condition, their families, carers and friends; recognises in particular the efforts of Louise Hunter of Kilmarnock, a copy of whose booklet, <em>Hey, I&rsquo;m Alive,</em> has been made available to all MSPs; considers that the booklet describes very clearly and with much good humour the difficulties that Louise has faced as someone with Friedrich&rsquo;s Ataxia, including in securing a proper diagnosis of her condition, which manifested itself from a very young age and was initially diagnosed as cerebral palsy; further considers that, despite experiencing considerable discrimination, Louise has made great personal efforts and received support from many organisations and individuals, including her former school, James Hamilton Academy, and Margaret Jamieson, former MSP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, who assisted in securing sponsorship for publication of the booklet, and is pleased to endorse the sentiment of Louise&rsquo;s favourite saying, you are never fully dressed without a smile.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7616 Kenneth Gibson: Disability Benefit Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled by the decision of the UK Government to scrap a series of benefits for disabled people including the Independent Living Fund and the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance; recognises that the Independent Living Fund directly supports 3,654 disabled people in Scotland to help them live independently in the community rather than in residential care; further condemns the scrapping of the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance, which also affords disabled people the ability to live independently of carers by providing them with a small budget to help with transportation costs or running their own vehicle; recalls plans by the Labour Party earlier this year to scrap both Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance to pay for the creation of a National Care Service<em> </em>only for those<em> </em>in England and Wales; recognises that independent analysis by the Institute for Social and Economic Research predicted that the removal of Attendance Allowance would result in over 67,000 disabled people in Scotland being forced into poverty, and considers that the unionist parties at Westminster have a track record of picking on the poorest and most vulnerable people in society in an attempt to rectify the negative outcomes of their own financial ineptitude.</p>
