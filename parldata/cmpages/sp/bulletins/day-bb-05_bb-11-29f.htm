<p><b>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </b></p>
<p><b>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</b></p>
<p><b>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</b></p>
<p><b>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</b></p>
<p><b>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>New and altered motions and amendments</b></p>
<p>*<b>S2M-3646</b> <b>Ms Sandra White:</b> <b>Positive Action in Housing</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Positive Action in Housing (PAH) and its director, Robina Qureshi, for the excellent work that they do, especially with refugees and asylum seekers in often difficult circumstances; notes the comments by Tom Harris MP on the BBC&rsquo;s Politics Show, suggesting that PAH&rsquo;s funding should be looked at by the Scottish Executive because of its campaign against dawn raids; believes that this would set an unacceptable precedent whereby independent organisations would only be allowed to say things consistent with Executive policy; notes that the Scottish Compact of 2003 between the Executive, its agencies, non-departmental public bodies and the voluntary sector in Scotland states &quot;The Compact acknowledges that the voluntary sector and the Executive have their own spheres of action with different roles, responsibilities and resources. It is accepted that not all voluntary organisations will have an interest in seeking partnership with the Executive.&nbsp;Some will pursue their own objectives without reference to the state. Others may find themselves&nbsp;more often in opposition to the Executive than in partnership&quot;, and condemns the comments made by Tom Harris MP.</p>
<p>*<b>S2M-3645</b> <b>Roseanna Cunningham:</b> <b>Fair Trade in Schools</b>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Perth and Kinross Council to introduce fair trade goods in local schools and congratulates Iain Jarvie of Kinross High School, who initiated the campaign, and all the pupils in schools throughout Perth and Kinross who signed and supported his petition.</p>
<p>*<b>S2M-3644</b> <b>Roseanna Cunningham:</b> <b>Black Watch Red Hackle</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes and reaffirms the terms of motion S2M-2165 in the name of Murdo Fraser on proposed defence reviews from a Scottish perspective, which was debated and passed, as amended by S2M-2165.1, by the Parliament on 16 December 2004; further notes that even many of those members who opposed the motion supported the belief that the traditions, community links and identities of Scotland&rsquo;s infantry battalions should be maintained; expresses deep concern at the decision by the Army Board to renege on its much-publicised deal to allow the Black Watch to continue to wear the Red Hackle, and believes that this move signals a determination to end all sense of individual identities within the new amalgamated regiment.</p>
<p>*<b>S2M-3643</b> <b>Cathie Craigie:</b> <b>Kilbowie Art and Design Exhibition</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates young people from various North Lanarkshire schools involved in the Kilbowie Art and Design course; supports the aims of the course which offer potential post-Higher and art school and college candidates the opportunity to identify and investigate source material in a visually stimulating environment; further congratulate the students on the quality of their work recently exhibited in Cumbernauld New Town Hall, and commends North Lanarkshire Council for its commitment to the course.</p>
<p>*<b>S2M-3642#</b> <b>Bruce Crawford:</b> <b>Beauly to Denny Power Line: Concerns Over Increase of Childhood Leukaemia</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of the Draper Report into the link between high voltage power lines and levels of childhood leukaemia which, among other findings, concluded that children who live within 200 metres of high voltage power lines were nearly twice as likely to have childhood leukaemia as those who lived within 600 metres of a line; further notes that the National Radiological Protection Board recommended that the UK Government should consider the need for further precautionary measures and, as a consequence, the Stakeholder Advisory Group on ELF EMFs was formed to explore the implications of a precautionary approach and make practical recommendations; is concerned that, with regard to the application by Scottish and Southern Energy to construct a high voltage power line between Beauly and Denny, a survey carried out by Stirling Before Pylons of the Stirling Council area shows that 50 houses are within 100 metres of the pylon corridor, that 48 flats housing approximately 330 students at Stirling University are within 200 metres and that 878 houses are within 600 metres of the pylon corridor, and believes, therefore, in view of the reports showing a link between high voltage power lines and childhood leukaemia and the results of the Stirling Before Pylons survey, that the Scottish Executive should seriously examine these matters as part of its consideration of the application or indeed any future public enquiries which might be held.</p><p>Supported by: Ms Sandra White<b>*</b>, Fiona Hyslop<b>*</b>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<b>*</b>, Carolyn Leckie<b>*</b>, Frances Curran<b>*</b> </p>
<p>*<b>S2M-3641</b> <b>Frances Curran:</b> <b>Congratulations to Arran Schools on Improvements to School Meals</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Arran schools on plans to improve their school dinners by sourcing up to 70% of the ingredients used in the preparation of school meals from local suppliers, making schoolchildren healthier and reducing the use of processed foods; agrees that this is a great initiative which will also benefit local producers but that it will still only reach the 46% of school pupils who take school meals, and believes that free healthy school meals for all schoolchildren would ensure that all children would get a daily healthy meal.</p>

<p>*<b>S2M-3640</b> <b>Frances Curran:</b> <b>Humanitarian Crisis in Pakistan</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that seven weeks after the earthquake in Pakistan the people living in the affected area, particularly Kashmir, are facing a humanitarian crisis; further notes that 3.3 million people are homeless and without proper shelter as winter snows loom and 67,000 people are wounded and in desperate need of medical treatment; is concerned that, while the Pakistan Government has called for $500 million in aid, current pledges from the United Nations and governments fall well short of that, while in 2003 Pakistan paid $2.5 billion in debt repayments, including $500 million to the World Bank and $600 million to the International Monetary Fund; believes that these institutions and the rich banks of the west could easily free the resources to rebuild Kashmir and the affected areas if they cancelled one year&rsquo;s debt repayments, and supports the immediate cancellation of Pakistan&rsquo;s public foreign debt and calls for the money to be directed to the millions of people now facing a humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p>*<b>S2M-3639</b> <b>Nora Radcliffe:</b> <b>Opposition to Nuclear Power</b>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the UK Government&rsquo;s historical reluctance over the last 20 years to invest in renewable energy; further regrets that the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has already admitted that it will not achieve its 10% renewable energy target by 2010 and notes the progress that the Scottish Executive has made towards meeting its renewables target; regrets even more that the Prime Minister is supporting nuclear power, while the DTI has admitted that questions of finance, government support, market mechanisms, public support and storage of radioactive waste are all still unanswered; believes that efforts to present nuclear power as the solution to climate change are significantly undermined by the fact that electricity generation contributes less than a third of greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland; supports the Executive in its efforts to promote renewable energy, and calls on the UK Government to work on realistic approaches to cutting carbon emissions, rather than pretending that a discredited nuclear power industry can make a significant contribution.</p>
<p>*<b>S2M-3638</b> <b>Mrs Margaret Ewing:</b> <b>World AIDS Day 2005: Red Ribbon</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 1 December 2005 marks World AIDS Day, the international day of action on HIV and AIDS which takes place every year; recognises that last year in the United Kingdom over 8,000 people were infected by HIV/AIDS, while worldwide over 4.9 million people were newly infected, and welcomes the fact that this year World AIDS Day is about wearing the Red Ribbon as a sign of support for people living with HIV and a symbol of hope for the future, and notes that by getting people involved, more people will be aware of the dangers and facts of the disease and will take measures to reduce the risk of infection.</p>

<p>*<b>S2M-3637</b> <b>Margaret Jamieson:</b> <b>Food for Life School of the Year</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hurlford Primary School in Kilmarnock, the pilot school of East Ayrshire Council, on being awarded the Soil Association&rsquo;s Food for Life School of the Year Award; recognises the commitment of the pupils and all staff in promoting and educating the pupils and their families to embrace Food for Life, and welcomes the recent decision of East Ayrshire Council to expand the pilot across a further 10 schools.</p>
