          <p><strong>*S1M-3503</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: 60th Anniversary 
            of the Battle of El Alamein</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the 51st Highland Regiment and the 51st Highland Division Association 
            for organising, with support from Perth and Kinross Council, the 60th 
            Anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein Reunion and Commemorative 
            Event to be held in Perth on Saturday 26 October 2002; notes that 
            the event is expected to be the largest event of its kind outwith 
            London and will involve veterans, Regular Army, Territorial Army, 
            Army Cadet Force and bands from regimental associations and affiliated 
            organisations; remembers the fallen and all who served in the North 
            Africa campaigns of the second world war, and pays particular tribute 
            to the crucial role played by the 51st Highland Division in the Battle 
            of El Alamein on 23 October 1942.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>

            (Scotland) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2002</strong>-That the Justice 
            1 Committee, in consideration of the draft Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 
            1986 Amendment Regulations 2002, recommends that the Regulations be

            <em>Asylum seekers: meeting their healthcare needs</em> by the British 
            Medical Association; recognises the findings of the report, in particular 
            that the health of asylum seekers may actually deteriorate after entry 
            to the UK, and considers that the Scottish Executive should allocate 
            sufficient funding and implement effective policies to promote the 
            health of this minority group.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong>, Mr Andrew Welsh<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3500</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: The Firefighters' 
            Dispute</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the fire fighters' 
            pay claim is justified and that the fire fighters have been left with 
            no alternative but to take industrial action; calls on all MSPs and 
            trade unionists to give the Fire Brigades Union their backing, and 
            further calls on the Scottish Executive to convey support for their 
            claim to Her Majesty's Government.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3499#</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Nuisance to Communities 
            Caused by Seagulls </strong>-That the Parliament notes that seagulls 
            are causing an increasing nuisance in communities across Scotland 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should develop best practice 
            guidance on how to tackle the problems associated with seagulls.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Phil Gallie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3498</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: The Food Protection 
            (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) 
            (No.13) (Scotland) Order 2002</strong>-That the Health and Community 
            Care Committee, in consideration of the Food Protection (Emergency 
            Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.13) (Scotland) 
            Order 2002, recommends that the Order be approved.</p>

            for the Welfare of Livestock: Animal Health and Biosecurity (SE/2002/273)</strong>-That 
            the Rural Development Committee recommends that the Codes of Recommendations 
            for the Welfare of Livestock: Animal Health and Biosecurity (SE/2002/273) 
            be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3496</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Effective Performance 
            in Ministerial Office</strong>-That the Parliament notes, with admiration, 
            Estelle Morris's view that ministers should constantly assess their 
            performance in office and should resign if they believe that they 
            are no longer doing an effective job and commends this approach to 
            the current ministerial team in the Scottish Executive.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3495</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Shetland in Scotland 
            in Sweden Event</strong>-That the Parliament notes the prominent role 
            played by Shetland musicians and food in the successful Scotland in 
            Sweden event, including Shetland lamb taking a prominent role on the 
            menu for the Scottish dinner for Swedish businessmen and Shetland 
            group, Fiddlers Bid, bringing Shetland music to the event; welcomes 
            the benefits Scotland can gain by giving such recognition to Shetland 
            produce and culture, and hopes that the outcome will be the strengthening 
            of Shetland's economic and cultural links with its Nordic neighbours.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3494#</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant: Alain Baxter</strong>-That 
            the Parliament deplores the failure of the Court of Arbitration for 
            Sport to award Alain Baxter the bronze medal which he won during the 
            2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City; notes that the court described 
            Alain Baxter, in its verdict, as &quot;a sincere and honest man&quot; 
            and that he did not intend to gain a competitive advantage, and considers 
            that the bronze medal should be returned to Mr Baxter immediately 
            and that the British Olympic Association should withdraw its ban on 
            him from competing in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3493</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor: Annual Shinty/Hurling

            shinty/hurling international between Scotland and Ireland; recognises 
            the effect that this fixture has in bringing the two countries together; 
            wishes the Scottish team all the best for the match; acknowledges 
            the significance of traditional Scottish sports such as shinty to 
            communities throughout Scotland and, in particular, to those in the 
            Highlands and Islands, and condemns the decision of Her Majesty's 
            Government to reduce lottery funding available to Scottish sports 
            such as shinty by instigating a multi-million pound raid on the national 
            lottery by establishing the New Opportunities Fund.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3492</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Queen of the South 
            FC: Bell's League Challenge Cup Win</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Queen of the South Football Club on winning the Bell's League Challenge 
            Cup, which is their first ever win of an national knockout competition; 
            notes that the cup victory follows last season's Second Division Championship 
            win, their first silverware for 51 years, and promotion to the First 
            Division and that the club's endeavours have been an enormous boost 
            not only for its fans but the whole community, and commends the team, 
            the manager, the chairman and the board and everybody else associated 
            with the club on their efforts. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Alasdair Morgan<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mr Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong>, Phil Gallie<strong>*</strong>, Lord 
            James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3491#</strong> <strong>Gordon Jackson: Central College 
            of Commerce, Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its concern 
            over the present situation at Central College of Commerce, Glasgow; 
            notes the friction which exists between the teaching staff and management 
            there and also the vote in favour of strike action, and invites the 
            Scottish Executive to launch an urgent inquiry into reports of mismanagement 
            at the college before further harm is done to the college and its 
            students. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3490 Alain Baxter and the IOC</strong> (lodged on 16 
            October 2002) Brian Adam<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3488#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Support for Families 
            and Children</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">believes 
            that, in the light of research showing that 50% of persistent offenders 
            first come before children's panels as being in need of care and protection 
            because of domestic violence or family breakdown, the Scottish Executive 
            should give much greater support to voluntary organisations that support 
            families and children suffering violence or breakdown, so that such 
            organisations can fulfil a bigger role, in co-operation with social 
            work services departments, in preventing such crises leading to young 
            people embarking on a career of offending.</a></p>
