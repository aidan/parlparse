<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="bb-02-15j.htm#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5596&diams; </strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> <strong>Celebrating Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the substantive progress being made in tackling sectarianism in Scotland; commends the initiatives undertaken by Scotland&rsquo;s largest football clubs, Rangers FC and Celtic FC, to counter sectarian attitudes; congratulates the football clubs on their initiatives, Pride over Prejudice and Bhoys Against Bigotry; notes the success of their highly commendable joint educational programme, the Old Firm Alliance, within Glasgow schools; recognises that the significant progress achieved in tackling sectarianism represents a continuing determination by both clubs to help eradicate the problem, and also commends the informal arrangements between old firm supporters in the Western Isles as an example for the rest of the country.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5595</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>The Draft Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005: Draft Guidance for Licensing Boards and Local Authorities</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that the draft Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005: Draft Guidance for Licensing Boards and Local Authorities (SE 2007/9) be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5594</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>The Draft Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Notification Requirements) (Scotland) Regulations 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Justice 2 Committee recommends that the draft Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Notification Requirements) (Scotland) Regulations 2007 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5593</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>The Draft Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006 (Modification of Agency&rsquo;s Powers and Incidental Provision) Order 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Justice 2 Committee recommends that the draft Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006 (Modification of Agency&rsquo;s Powers and Incidental Provision) Order 2007 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5592</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Unicef Report on Child Poverty Shames UK</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is ashamed to find that, according to UNICEF&rsquo;s <em>Report Card 7, Child Poverty in Perspective: An Overview of Child Well-being in Rich Countries,</em> the United Kingdom has come last in a comparative examination of children&rsquo;s well-being in 21 countries; believes that this report on child poverty, deprivation, quality of life, safety, health and behaviour is a terrible indictment of the failure of government policy in Britain; notes that, while other countries have made real progress on many fronts, the British government has fared particularly badly; notes that the countries of Scandinavia have fared far better and generally occupy the top places in the study because of their policies to redistribute wealth and the higher political priority given by their governments to children&rsquo;s needs, and concludes that, if Britain is to be rid of this particular badge of shame, then improving children&rsquo;s well-being in Britain must now become an urgent priority.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5591</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Scottish NHS Treatment and Care of Former Servicemen and Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is of the view that the very best NHS treatment must be given to the young Scottish men and women who have been discharged from the British armed services as a result of the physical and mental wounds that they have suffered in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere; notes that the absence of military hospitals anywhere in the United Kingdom places additional burdens on these courageous young ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen and also those involved in their treatment, care and rehabilitation; is confident that the NHS personnel are more than equal to this challenge; wishes to remind the nation that our servicemen and servicewomen are rightly acknowledged as among the finest of the United Nations&rsquo; peacekeepers, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive, working in tandem with the Ministry of Defence, to ensure that sufficient means are given to those concerned with the NHS treatment and care of these young military veterans so that they can return to their communities as soon as possible and in the knowledge that the NHS has shown to them the compassionate care they so eminently deserve.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5584</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Against Bullying in the Workplace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent case where Jonah Ditton, who was bullied and sacked while working at Glasgow-based firm CP Publishing Ltd, was awarded nearly &pound;120,000 as a result of unfair dismissal and bullying due to his sexual orientation; believes that there is no place for bullying of any kind in the workplace or in our society, including bullying based on sexuality, age, gender, disability, ethnicity, race or religion, and urges all employers in Scotland to take note of this case and work to ensure that workplaces are free of such bullying.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5583</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Disband the SBCCU</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the establishment of the Special Branch Community Contact Unit (SBCCU) by Tayside Police in that its actions appear focussed on monitoring anti-war, Palestinian rights and Muslim groups within Dundee&rsquo;s further education institutions; also notes that members of the SBCCU attended the University of Dundee Freshers&rsquo; Fair, did not identify themselves as police officers and proceeded to question students staffing the Stop the War stall about their plans for future activities and views on the situation in the Middle East; further notes with concern the SBCCU&rsquo;s practice of sitting in on meetings of the Islamic Society within the University of Dundee; expresses concern that information collected by Tayside SBCCU may also be passed overseas, including to countries with poor human rights records, a particular concern as a university like Dundee attracts a large number of overseas students; believes that such actions put Muslim groups under suspicion and are extremely unhelpful in the current Islamophobic climate and that such action by the police engenders fear in students, discourages them from participating in political activities, stifles debate and undermines the very principle of academic freedom within universities and colleges; further believes that it should not be the role of Special Branch officers to monitor the political activities of student groups on university and college campuses; congratulates the representatives of the University and College Union who have joined students in publicly voicing their concerns about the unit in Dundee; calls on Tayside Police to radically rethink its strategy for community bridge-building and the role of Special Branch in it, and calls for the disbandment of the SBCCU.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5582</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Location of Creative Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, while supporting the general principal of dispersal of Scottish Executive departments and agencies throughout Scotland, nevertheless believes that Creative Scotland must remain in Scotland&rsquo;s capital city, which plays host to the world&rsquo;s biggest international festival of the arts; notes that its remaining in Edinburgh would result in meetings and conferences concerning the arts in Edinburgh and elsewhere in Scotland being held every week of the year; expresses concern that moving Creative Scotland out of Edinburgh may jeopardise the contribution made to Scotland&rsquo;s income from tourism and culture during the period of the Edinburgh Festival, and urges the Executive to support the City of Edinburgh Council in its plans to locate Creative Scotland in a new and completely sympathetic environment in one of the developments that will further advance the attractiveness of Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5566*#*</strong> <strong>John Home Robertson:</strong> <strong>The Battle of Prestonpans, 1745</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the historic significance of battlefield sites from Scotland&rsquo;s violent past and notes the success of the National Trust for Scotland in interpreting the site of the final defeat of the Jacobite army at Culloden Moor; recognises the powerful case for protection and appropriate management of hitherto neglected battlefield sites throughout Scotland; pays tribute to the Battle of Prestonpans (1745) Heritage Trust for its proposals to preserve, enhance and interpret the site of the Jacobite victory of 21 September 1745 and welcomes the active support of the wider local community for this initiative, and hopes that the battlefield site at Prestonpans will be protected and made accessible for the benefit of local people and visitors.</p>
