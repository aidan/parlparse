<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions  and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on  which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments  lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin  every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains  any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the  Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked  with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3475 Margaret Smith: Parenting  Across Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises the diverse nature of family  life in Scotland; acknowledges the difficulties faced by parents in light of  personal and professional pressures; notes the importance of good family  relationships for the health, well-being and achievement of parents and their  children; congratulates parents for the work that they do in raising the next  generation of Scottish citizens, and congratulates Parenting Across Scotland  for its efforts to highlight and celebrate the role of parenting both during  National Parents&rsquo; Week and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3474 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Scotland&rsquo;s  Coastline&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises that Scotland has some of the most  beautiful coastline in the world; further recognises that the Scottish  Executive has made efforts to clean up our coasts and seas, particularly  through the Scottish Coastal Forum; recognises that our huge tourism industry  depends on Scotland having clean beaches and seas; understands that there is  much work still to be done and some of our coastline is still littered with rubbish  and other pollution, and calls on the Executive and other relevant public  agencies to redouble their efforts in cleaning up our coastline and seas for  our own quality of life, for tourism, for wildlife and for future generations.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3473# Maureen Macmillan: Outsourcing  of Rail Call Centre Jobs from Vertex Call Centre, Dingwall&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament notes with concern the issuing of the 90-day notices to the 200-plus  workforce at the Vertex Call Centre in Dingwall; notes that the loss of these  jobs will have a major impact on this small Highland town; further notes that  these jobs have been put in jeopardy by the decision of TheTrainline, a company  which has Virgin Trains as its major shareholder, to move the contract outwith  the European Union, in spite of Virgin Trains being in receipt of substantial  amounts of UK taxpayers&rsquo; money; supports the campaign of the Transport Salaried  Staff&rsquo;s Association on behalf of the call centre workers who are a highly  skilled and loyal workforce, and believes that the Scottish Executive should  consider what influence it can exert to reverse TheTrainline&rsquo;s decision or  assist Vertex in finding a new contract.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3472 Linda Fabiani: Treatment  of Asylum Seekers&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament deprecates the treatment of asylum  seekers in this country and, in particular, condemns the dawn raids and forced  removals which have been a feature of the treatment recently; agrees with the  sentiment expressed by the Minister for Communities in the Chamber on 22  September 2005 of &ldquo;absolutely appalling&rdquo; in connection with the forced removal  of the Vucaj family (<em>Official Report</em>c. 19391); calls for an immediate amnesty, similar to the 2003 amnesty, for  all asylum-seeker families resident in Scotland with children in the school  system, and asserts that the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 should apply to all  children in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3471 Trish Godman: Tribute  to Rosa Parks, American Civil Rights Campaigner&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament pays  tribute to Rosa Parks, the black American civil rights campaigner, who died on  24 October 2005, named by <em>Time </em>magazine as one of the 100 most important  people in the history of the United States of America; acknowledges that, from  that historic day in 1995 when she refused to move from the &ldquo;white&rdquo; section of  a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks was, for all of her life, a staunch,  courageous and passionate advocate of a peaceful strategy of non-violence in  the campaign to secure civil rights for black American citizens, and is of the  view that this advocacy, combined with her moral courage, inspired millions of  other people peacefully to support the Civil Rights Movement, that she rightly  deserved the Congressional Gold Medal, awarded to her by President Clinton, and  that she will long remain an inspirational figure for all those committed to a  non-violent strategy for democratic advancement.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3470 Jim Mather: Return  of William Wallace Letter, &ldquo;The Safe Conduct&rdquo;, to Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament believes that the letter, carried by Sir William Wallace from the  King of France and known as &ldquo;The Safe Conduct&rdquo;, guaranteeing his safe passage  and supporting his bid for an audience with the Pope, which was taken from him  when he was betrayed, should be held in Scotland where it should be available  to the public and calls on the National Museums of Scotland, the National  Library of Scotland and the National Archives of Scotland to seek the letter&rsquo;s  permanent return to Scotland from the National Archives at Kew for display in  Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3469 Mr Mark Ruskell: GM-Free  Areas&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the recent ruling of the European Court of  Justice against Upper Austria&rsquo;s law outlawing the cultivation of GM crops;  acknowledges the singular lack of demand for GM produce within the European  Union; believes that European regions must have the right to determine whether  or not they allow GM crops to be grown; congratulates Scottish local  authorities that have declared a GM ban, and calls on the Scottish Executive to  declare Scotland a GM-free area forthwith.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3468.1 Mrs Nanette Milne: Delivering  for Health&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3468) in the name of Mr Andy  Kerr, leave out from &ldquo;of NHS boards&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;to discuss the future  structure of the NHS in Scotland; welcomes the report&rsquo;s emphasis on shifting  the balance of care to provide more safe and sustainable local services,  including intensive case management in the community for the most vulnerable;  welcomes the commitment to tackle health inequalities by developing  anticipatory care in our most deprived communities and applying the approach to  benefit people wherever they live; however notes that, despite higher funding  for the NHS in Scotland, too many patients are still having to wait too long  for treatment; believes that a truly patient-centred NHS will only be possible  if professionals are given the freedom to prioritise treatment by clinical need  rather than by government targets and if purchasing power is put in the hands  of patients so that their choices determine the development of the service,  and, to that end, calls for the establishment of foundation hospitals within  NHS Scotland and for continuing increase in the capacity available to treat NHS  patients by extending the use of the independent sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3468.2 Carolyn Leckie: Delivering  for Health&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3468) in the name of Mr Andy  Kerr, leave out from first &ldquo;commends&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;notes the action plan  for NHS Scotland, &ldquo;Delivering for Health&rdquo;, and its acceptance of Professor  David Kerr&rsquo;s report, <em>Building a Health  Service Fit for the Future</em>, as the basis of NHS boards&rsquo; future service  change proposals; is concerned that the over-centralisation of services, which  is against the wishes of communities up and down Scotland, may not be prevented  by all of the above; is concerned to ensure that any change is democratic in  that it actively involves communities and staff in making the key decisions  that affect service provision; is extremely concerned about the opportunities  for encroachment by the private sector into the NHS which the report  represents; notes the Minister for Health and Community Care&rsquo;s and the  Executive&rsquo;s increased communication and collaboration with the private health  care sector; notes the alarming developments in England where the Government is  attempting to transfer NHS clinical staff to the private sector; opposes the  idea that incentivisation can improve health care and believes that the NHS is  fundamentally under threat as a public health care system and requires urgent  action to protect and improve it including increased investment in training to  provide more NHS doctors, dentists, clinicians, other professionals and  valuable support staff to increase the NHS&rsquo;s own capacity, and believes that  Scotland&rsquo;s stark health inequalities will be intensified by increased involvement  of the private sector and that the current funding mechanisms of the NHS are  inadequate to address inequalities and require wide-ranging reform.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3468.3 Shona Robison: Delivering  for Health&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3468) in the name of Mr Andy  Kerr, leave out from &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;, and considers that more  needs to be done to bring down waiting times for patients, including the  introduction of individual patient waiting time guarantees based on their  particular needs, the expansion of diagnostic and treatment centres within the  NHS and the introduction of an element of activity-based payment for hospitals  to encourage greater efficiency and utilisation of spare capacity in the NHS.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3466 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Substitution on Committees&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament agrees that Carolyn Leckie be appointed to replace Ms Rosemary Byrne  as the Scottish Socialist Party substitute on the Justice 2 Committee.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3465 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Substitution on Committees&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament agrees that Ms Rosemary Byrne be appointed to replace Carolyn Leckie  as the Scottish Socialist Party substitute on the Equal Opportunities  Committee.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3422*#* Carolyn Leckie: Treating Autism&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates Action Against Autism for organising the pioneering  conference, &ldquo;Autism is Treatable&rdquo;, which took place on 15 October 2005;  recognises the expertise demonstrated by the international scientists and  medical professionals who led most sessions, especially since their work has  been developed within a climate of hostility, and believes that the credible  evidence of varying levels of recovery from the characteristics of autism in  medically-treated US children should not be dismissed and that further efforts  to explore the bio-medical model of autism in Scotland deserve the support of  the Scottish Executive and the medical establishment.</p>
