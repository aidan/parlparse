                                        <p> <strong>*S3M-6050 Bill Wilson: Ethiopia&rsquo;s Gibe 3 Dam, Europe Must Not Fund Environmental Devastation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is alarmed by reports by Campagna per la Riforma della Banca Mondiale, Counterbalance, Friends of Lake Turkana and International Rivers that the European Investment Bank is considering financing the construction of the Gibe 3 Dam in Ethiopia; notes that these NGOs believe that this dam threatens the land and livelihoods of 500,000 tribal people in Southern Ethiopia and Northern Kenya and that, by ending the river&rsquo;s natural flood cycle, it would destroy harvests and grazing lands along the river banks and fisheries in Lake Turkana and that it would devastate the unique culture and ecosystems of the Lower Omo Valley and Lake Turkana, both recognised as UNESCO World Heritage Sites; further notes their contentions that the dam violates Ethiopia&rsquo;s constitution, international conventions, the environmental safeguard policies of international financial institutions and the strategic priorities of the independent World Commission on Dams, that most of the affected people know very little about the project, that the Ethiopian Government is clamping down on dissent and that affected people are not able to express their views or get independent information about the project; calls on the European Union to investigate the truth of these claims and to oppose the dam&rsquo;s completion, rather than fund it, should even some of these fears and allegations be true, and calls on all interested parties to consider signing the petition at <a href="http://www.stopgibe3.org" target="_blank">http://www.stopgibe3.org</a>.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6049 Hugh Henry: Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Huntington&rsquo;s disease is a devastating, high-risk, inherited, neurological condition that causes a profound form of dementia and mental ill health; commends the hard work done by the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association based in Paisley in raising awareness of Huntington&rsquo;s disease; welcomes the joining together of the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association and the Huntington&rsquo;s associations of Ireland, England and Wales and Northern Ireland to work collaboratively to raise awareness of Huntington&rsquo;s disease, and calls on all MSPs to support the efforts of the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association to redress the awareness deficit.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6048 Jackie Baillie: Help for West Dunbartonshire Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Accounts Commission best value follow-up report on West Dunbartonshire Council; further notes that this is the third such report and that SNP-controlled West Dunbartonshire Council is the only local authority out of 32 across Scotland that has failed to make sufficient progress; understands that the Accounts Commission has raised concerns about the lack of strategic leadership, the continuing poor level of staff morale and difficulties with officer/member relations; further understands that the report highlights the financial position of the council and the lack of reserves, which stand at only &pound;258,000; further notes the report&rsquo;s conclusion that the council faces significant pressure in achieving operational sustainability and financial stability; believes that the council&rsquo;s response to these findings has been shockingly complacent, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to intervene and provide much-needed support for the council in order to protect the interests of the people of West Dunbartonshire and the hard-working council staff.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6047 Jamie Stone: Congratulations to Staff at Caithness General&rsquo;s Baby Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates staff at Caithness General Hospital&rsquo;s baby unit for becoming accredited by the Baby Friendly Initiative, a programme run by UNICEF and the World Health Organisation that promotes breastfeeding and improved care of mothers and babies; recognises the positive impact that the consultant-led maternity unit has on expectant mothers in Caithness who would otherwise endure potentially high-risk journeys to Inverness, and welcomes the news that an offer has been made to strengthen the service of the Caithness unit and to fill the consultant vacancy.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6046 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the National Bus Travel Concession Scheme for Older and Disabled Persons (Scotland) Amendment Order 2010 be approved.</p>
