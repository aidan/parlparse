          <P>9.30 am&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</P>
          <P><EM>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish National Party Debate on A Better Deal for Pensioners&mdash;</P>
          <blockquote>
            <p><STRONG>S2M-1940</strong> <STRONG>Nicola Sturgeon:</STRONG> <STRONG>A Better Deal for Pensioners</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Scotland must face up to the twin challenges of tackling current pensioner poverty and ensuring decent living standards for future generations of pensioners; believes that removing the pensions means test would help to achieve both of these objectives, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring pressure to bear on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to begin the process of replacing means-testing with a citizen&rsquo;s pension. </p>
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p><STRONG>S2M-1940.5</strong> <STRONG>Karen Whitefield: A Better Deal for Pensioners</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the vision of a Scotland in which every older person matters and every person beyond working age has a decent quality of life; considers that older people&rsquo;s lives have been improved through devolution across a wide range of areas such as health, transport, housing, social justice, volunteering, lifelong learning and tackling anti-social behaviour; recognises the range of measures specifically designed to improve the quality of life of all older people in Scotland, including free personal care for the elderly, free off-peak local bus travel, the central heating programme and funding for the Warm Deal; endorses the partnership between the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to tackle pensioner poverty, and welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s continuing commitment to improving the lives of all of Scotland&rsquo;s senior citizens.&quot;  </p>
            <p><STRONG>S2M-1940.1</strong> <STRONG>Mary Scanlon: A Better Deal for Pensioners</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;condemns the Chancellor&rsquo;s promotion of the means test which acts as a major disincentive to save; believes that linking the basic state pension to earnings would lift a million pensioners out of means-testing over a four year period; calls for greater measures to encourage personal savings, and acknowledges that only a Conservative administration at Westminster can implement these changes for the benefit of all Scotland&rsquo;s pensioners.&quot;  </p>
            <p><STRONG>S2M-1940.4</strong> <STRONG>Robert Brown: A Better Deal for Pensioners</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the progress made by the Scottish Executive in ensuring a better deal for pensioners through the introduction of free personal care, a national free off-peak bus scheme and a free central heating and insulation scheme; recognises that pensions policy is reserved to the UK Government; believes that the UK government&rsquo;s policy on pensions has failed as nearly 2 million pensioners are missing out on the pension credits that they are entitled to and deserve due to demeaning and unworkable means-testing, and further believes that the state pension must be reformed to ensure that everyone has a decent income in retirement by implementing the Liberal Democrat proposal for a Citizen&rsquo;s Pension, initially for those over 75, with entitlement based on residency and not National Insurance contributions, restoring the link between earnings and pensions, making older pensioners better off by &pound;25 per week for single pensioners and lifting one million UK pensioners out of means-testing.&quot; </p>
            <p> <STRONG>S2M-1940.2</strong> <STRONG>John Swinburne: A Better Deal for Pensioners</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;and restore the link, broken in 1982, between pensions and average national earnings.&quot; </p>

          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
            <P><STRONG>S2M-1943.1</strong> <STRONG>Christine Grahame: Domestic Abuse Services</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1943) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;and welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses its concern, however, at the level of secure funding to agencies working in this area and the lack of suitably-located alternative accommodation for the victims of domestic abuse, particularly those with children; further expresses concern that services for elderly people who are victims of domestic abuse are even more limited, and commends the role of Tayside Domestic Abuse Service, the only service of its kind in Scotland where police and a voluntary organisation work together to support the victims of abuse, as a model of effective partnership working.&quot;  </P>
            <P><STRONG>S2M-1943.2</strong> <STRONG>Margaret Mitchell: Domestic Abuse Services</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1943) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes with grave concern the escalating pattern of repeat victimisation highlighting the fact that more and more victims are trapped in abusive situations; acknowledges and welcomes the range of initiatives in this area that have been funded by the Scottish Executive in the last few years, and calls on the Executive to continue to explore different means to raise awareness of the issue generally and to ensure that individuals who are trapped in abusive situations are aware of these support services to help them escape from their abusive circumstances.&quot; </P>
            <P> <STRONG>S2M-1943.3</strong> <STRONG>Shiona Baird: Domestic Abuse Services</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1943) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes with concern that, despite Scottish Executive initiatives, domestic abuse continues to be widespread; recognises the recent public opinion poll from Amnesty International showing the level of complacency in society about domestic abuse; believes that tackling domestic abuse will require concerted effort by the Executive including a continued focus on public education and awareness-raising, in particular focusing on education and involving non-perpetrating men, along with extending support for those experiencing domestic abuse; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s recent announcement of &pound;6 million funding for children and young people experiencing domestic abuse but calls on the Executive to detail as soon as possible how this funding will be allocated; notes with concern that there is no national funding strategy for domestic abuse services, that funding for Women&rsquo;s Aid groups throughout Scotland is often on a yearly basis and that the quality of service varies widely according to local authority area and calls on the Executive to put in place a national funding strategy, and recognises that, to tackle domestic abuse effectively, Executive policy-making needs to take into account the interlinkages between all types of gender-based violence and continue to broaden its focus to encompass to all forms of violence against women including those in vulnerable minorities.&quot; </P>
