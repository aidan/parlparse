<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><b>New and altered motions and amendments</b></p>
<p><b>*S2M-4647</b> <b>Ms Maureen Watt:</b> <b>Energy Price Hikes</b>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the power companies for their latest round of price hikes and calls on ministers to intervene; notes that Scotland is an energy-rich country but recognises that many of our citizens suffer fuel poverty; calls on the Scottish Executive to expand insulation and central heating programmes throughout the country, and further calls on ministers to change planning law to ensure that all new homes reach the highest energy efficiency standards.</p>
<p><b>*S2M-4646</b> <b>Patrick Harvie:</b> <b>Rejection of Proposal to Legislate Against Hate Crime</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the many years of effort by equality organisations in Scotland to make the case for offences motivated by malice or ill will towards an individual based on their sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability to be taken seriously; notes that the headline recommendation of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Working Group on Hate Crime was for the introduction of a statutory aggravation for such offences; notes that ministers have taken over 20 months to respond to the group&rsquo;s report; notes with deep regret that, despite previous commitments to include legislation in the Sentencing Bill, the Executive has rejected this recommendation, citing the need for consistency in sentencing as its main reason; considers that this stated reason is absurd given that Scotland will now see no consistency, either in the way that different hate crimes are treated in Scottish courts or in the treatment of such crimes north and south of the border; considers that the Executive&rsquo;s decision to delay its response for so long and then to announce it on the last day before summer recess is insulting to the organisations that have contributed to this process; believes that there exists no good reason to avoid or delay legislation to introduce a statutory aggravation for hate crimes, and calls on the Executive to reconsider this decision urgently.</p>
<p><b>S2M-4645</b> <b>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</b> <b>Class Sizes Strategy</b>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that class sizes in Scottish schools should be set at a national maximum level of 20 for non-practical classes and 15 or less for practical classes; condemns the Scottish Executive for failing to reach targets for maximum classes in S1 and S2 mathematics and English classes; regrets that hundreds of newly qualified teachers who have completed their probationary year are without posts as they approach the summer holidays, and believes that the Executive should provide a strategy, including a timescale, to implement those commitments already made for S1 and S2 mathematics and English and the early stages of primary school and produce a longer-term strategy to reduce all class sizes to 20 for non-practical subjects in state schools, such a strategy to include the creation of posts for newly qualified teachers, and in addition undertake a survey of school capacity to ensure equality of access to education for all children, especially those in deprived areas such as parts of Ayrshire.</p>
<p><b>S2M-4644</b> <b>Mr Mark Ruskell:</b> <b>Scotland&rsquo;s Festival of Stewardship</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Falkland Centre for Stewardship, organisers of Scotland&rsquo;s first Festival of Stewardship, to be held at Falkland in Fife from 30 June to 2 July 2006; applauds the creativity and imagination which has been applied to developing an ambitious and attractive programme of festival events and activities over the weekend; notes that more information about the festival can be found at www.bigtent2006.co.uk; commends the Falkland Centre for Stewardship for its vision in bringing together communities, voluntary organisations and businesses in celebration of the important concept of stewardship, to encourage people to live and work sustainably; believes that the event offers great educational potential as a recipe for people to learn how to improve the quality of life and of the environment, while having fun at the same time; wishes this pioneering event the success that it deserves, and hopes that this year&rsquo;s festival may be the first of many such events to be held in future years.</p>

<p><b>S2M-4643</b> <b>Margaret Smith:</b> <b>Cash Machines</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing use of charging cash machines in Scotland; notes research from the Nationwide Building Society which found that UK consumers spent &pound;140 million on cash machine charges in 2004; further notes the projection by <i>Which? </i>that by 2015 over half of the cash machines in the United Kingdom are expected to charge for transactions; is concerned that these machines can prevent people having free access to their own money; is particularly concerned that there is a particularly negative impact in deprived areas such as Muirhouse, in Edinburgh, where there are no local bank branches to provide an alternative place to withdraw cash free and where local people are less likely to have credit or debit cards; is concerned that, for individuals on incapacity benefit withdrawing funds three times in one week, charges can amount to 8% of weekly income; supports the conclusions of the Treasury Select Committee&rsquo;s 2005 inquiry into cash machine charges, and calls for all charging machines to be clearly labelled, for the charges levied by cash machines to be capped at a rate that reflects the cost of transactions, for banks in Scotland to ensure that consumers have access to at least one free cash machine in every community and for the Scottish Executive to consider holding urgent talks with banks in Scotland to tackle the financial inclusion issues that this situation raises.</p>
<p><b>S2M-4642</b> <b>Margaret Jamieson:</b> <b>Crosshouse Hospital Volunteers</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates, and wishes continued success to, the 660 volunteers at Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, who in the five years since they commenced activity have gifted &pound;1,000,000 for the benefit of patients, staff and visitors of the hospital.</p>
<p><b>S2M-4641</b> <b>Chris Ballance:</b> <b>Nuclear Power in Scotland</b>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that decisions on energy and climate change are of hugely significant importance to the people, the economy and the environment of Scotland; further recognises that we are no nearer to delivering a solution to the problem of nuclear waste than we were 30 years ago and that we are at least 40 years from any realistic method of long-term storage; recognises that nuclear power will not tackle climate change; notes that imported sources of high-grade uranium ore are finite and that the carbon emissions associated with nuclear power rise further above those of the most efficient fossil fuel power stations as lower grades are used; recognises that Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy resource has the capacity to power Scotland many times over; further recognises the potential for energy savings through conservation and efficiency measures which pound-for-pound make much more economic sense than wasting money on nuclear power; notes that the new generation of nuclear power stations will result in a more-than-threefold increase in the amount of high-level nuclear waste to be dealt with; recognises that the building of new nuclear power stations would send a dangerous and misleading message to all countries in the world regarding the proliferation of nuclear technology and would add to the potential of devastating terrorist action; notes that nuclear power is uneconomic and that decommissioning will require massive public subsidy, on top of the already expanding budget of over &pound;70 billion, to deal with the legacy of current stations; recognises the important opportunity to decentralise energy production which would itself increase energy efficiency by 50%, and agrees with the Commission for Sustainable Development that it is political willpower that is needed, not nuclear power, to address climate change and energy security now and for the future.</p>

<p><b>S2M-4640</b> <b>Shiona Baird:</b> <b>The Future is Renewable</b>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that Ocean Power Delivery (OPD) has secured &pound;13 million of funding from a consortium of private investors; believes that offshore renewables, including wave power, have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s future economy; notes the findings of <i>Delivering the New Generation of Energy: A Route Map to Scotland&rsquo;s Renewable Future,</i> a study by the Scottish Renewables Forum showing that renewables can supply the majority of Scotland&rsquo;s annual electricity needs; welcomes recent reports indicating that the First Minister favours an expansion of the Scottish renewables industry in preference to new nuclear power, and calls on the Scottish Executive not only to embrace the full economic, social and environmental potential of Scotland&rsquo;s renewable resource as part of a truly sustainable energy policy but also to provide the practical support which the industry requires to achieve that potential.</p>

<p><b>S2M-4638#</b> <b>Fiona Hyslop:</b> <b>The Parliament and the Childcare Agenda</b>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of childcare provision to working parents in Scotland and reiterates the vision stated at the opening of the Parliament that it would be different, bold and modern in supporting a family-friendly agenda in Scotland; looks forward to the publication of the initial findings of the longitudinal study by the Scottish Executive, &quot;Growing up in Scotland&quot;, which has focused heavily on childcare needs and experiences in Scotland in the early years of its study of 9,000 children; asserts its own responsibility to take a lead as policy-maker, public institution and employer, both in word and deed, in driving forward a family-friendly childcare agenda which delivers quality, flexibility and choice for working parents; welcomes the recent pilot extension of the Parliament&rsquo;s visitors&rsquo; cr&egrave;che to include a short-term drop-in facility for passholders, and affirms its commitment to continue to look at innovative ways of leading the childcare agenda in Scotland, in addition to working in partnership with other employers, institutions and organisations in Edinburgh to deliver best practice in supporting choice and flexibility for excellent childcare provision in the city.</p>

<p><b>S2M-4637</b> <b>Patrick Harvie:</b> <b>M74 Legal Case</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with dismay that Friends of the Earth Scotland has been forced to withdraw from its legal case in the Court of Session against the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with construction of the M74 urban motorway; believes that this demonstrates the barriers faced by individuals and organisations seeking access to environmental justice; congratulates Friends of the Earth Scotland for its courageous decision to bring the case; believes that the ever-escalating cost of the project means that to proceed with construction would be a gross waste of public money; agrees with the findings of the independent public inquiry into the road that, &quot;the public benefits of the proposal would be insufficient to outweigh the considerable disadvantages that can be expected&quot;, and believes that proceeding with construction of the road would drive a bulldozer through the Executive&rsquo;s social justice, climate change and sustainable development commitments.</p>

<p><b>S2M-4636</b> <b>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</b> <b>Creeping Privatisation of the Royal Mail</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the creeping privatisation of the Royal Mail and, in particular, the closure of Crown post offices in towns and cities across Scotland; further notes that franchises cannot replace the service provided to communities by such post offices and is concerned that allowing franchises to take over will serve to exploit workers who currently earn &pound;9.60 an hour and will be expected to do the same job for &pound;5.15 an hour, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ask for an immediate review of the current status and number of Crown post offices in Scotland.</p>

<p><b>S2M-4635</b> <b>Mr Andrew Welsh:</b> <b>Happy Canada Day</b>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes all Canadians living in Scotland, and those with Canadian sympathies, a happy Canada Day on 1 July 2006; recognises that it was 139 years ago that the British North America Act 1867 created the Dominion of Canada and began the process of devolving power away from the London parliament to the Canadian state, and notes that highlights of this process included joining the League of Nations in 1921, the Statute of Westminster in 1931 which gave Canada complete control over both foreign affairs and domestic matters, the Citizenship Act of 1947 by which Canadians ceased to be British subjects and were created Canadian citizens, the loss of the House of Lords in 1949 as the final court of appeal for Canadians, to be replaced with the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Constitution Act of 1982 by which the parliament in London ceded its remaining powers over Canada.</p>

<p><b>S2M-4632#</b> <b>Maureen Macmillan:</b> <b>Elgin Bypass</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continued strong public support for an Elgin bypass; believes that a bypass is necessary to relieve the increasing problem of congestion in and around Elgin; welcomes the Moray 2020 strategy which recognises that, in order to enhance the area to attract inward investment, government dispersals and growing businesses, local transport links need to be transformed, and therefore believes that both Moray Council and the Scottish Executive should give a commitment to re-examine the case for an Elgin bypass.</p>

<p><b>S2M-4609</b> <b>Cathy Peattie:</b> <b>Antonine Wall and Kinneil Museum</b>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the support pledged to the World Heritage Site bid for the Antonine Wall by East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire; notes that this is part of a multinational bid incorporating Germany, Austria, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, linking sites that mark the boundaries of the Roman empire; believes that the Antonine Wall, running from Bo&rsquo;ness in the east to Old Kilpatrick in the west, is an outstanding archaeological treasure, not just nationally but internationally, and should be promoted as such; is therefore concerned that Kinneil Museum, at the eastern end of the wall near to the remains of a roman fortlet, is threatened with downgrading or closure; notes that about 2,000 people have signed a petition backing the campaign to save the museum, and calls on Falkirk Council to heed local and international voices and recognise that Kinneil Museum is a unique resource that should be retained and enhanced.</p>
