          <p><strong>*S1M-3217</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson: Dalmellington 
            Area Centre Project Management Team and the 2002 Prize for Public 
            Management Leadership</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Dalmellington Area Centre Project Management Team which consists 
            of officers from Ayrshire &amp; Arran Primary Care NHS Trust, East 
            Ayrshire Council and Strathclyde Police on achieving the Office for 
            Public Management 2002 prize for Public Management Leadership, and 
            looks forward to the roll-out across Scotland of this partnership 
            template for providing one-stop public facilities.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3216</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Financial Disadvantage 
            of Glasgow City Council</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            continuing damage to the city of Glasgow as a direct result of the 
            Tory reorganisation of local government in 1996; further notes that 
            Glasgow&#146;s first budget after reorganisation in 1996-97 resulted 
            in a £63 million reduction in expenditure and a 19.1% increase in 
            council tax, that the following two years&#146; budgets increased 
            the council tax by 22% and 9.4% respectively while reducing local 
            authority jobs by over 5,000 since local government reorganisation, 
            that Glasgow&#146;s budget has increased by 14.5% (only 1.2% in real 
            terms) compared to a Scottish average of 22.5% (8.2% in real terms) 
            and its council tax has increased by 39% compared to a Scottish average 
            of 31% and that the &quot;mismatch&quot; of funding caused by reorganisation 
            is a major cause of Glasgow&#146;s reduced expenditure but higher 
            council tax; is aware that Glasgow City Council is still compelled 
            to spend £36 million more on education and social work than it receives 
            in government support, such is the high level of deprivation and poverty 
            within the city, while its council tax at £1,141 for Band D is the 
            highest in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to respond positively 
            to the report by Professor Arthur Midwinter which highlights the need 
            for Glasgow to receive £32.6 million in supplementary grant as its 
            share of the £50 million owed to all local authorities financially 
            disadvantaged by the &quot;mismatch&quot; of funds after local government 
            reorganisation, and believes that Glasgow and the other affected local 
            authorities should receive the supplementary grants within the current 
            financial year.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3215</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Adults with Incapacity 
            (Specified Medical Treatments) (Scotland) Regulations 2002</strong>&#151;That 
            the Health and Community Care Committee recommends that nothing further 
            be done under the Adults with Incapacity (Specified Medical Treatments) 
            (Scotland) Regulations 2002 (SSI 2002/275).</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Margo MacDonald<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, 
            Andrew Wilson<strong>*</strong>, Mr Lloyd Quinan<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mr Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3214</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Job Losses at 
            O2 Call Centre, Thurso</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses 
            deep concern over the job losses that have occurred at the O2 call 
            centre in Thurso; notes the detrimental economic impact that this 
            will have on the local area; recognises the difficulty of suitable 
            job relocation for the workforce in the immediate area, and urges 
            action from the Scottish Executive, Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to assist Manpower in finding 
            other contracts which would fully utilise the distinctive skill base 
            of the workforce and, if necessary, find the recruitment opportunities 
            and/or training services to help the workforce find alternative employment.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3213</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Faslane Peace 
            Camp</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the Faslane peace 
            camp on achieving its 20th<sup> </sup>year of peaceful protest in 
            the campaign for a nuclear-free world.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3212</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: European Commission 
            Initiatives on the By-catching of Dolphins, Porpoises and Pilot Whales 
            in Fishing Gear</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the initiatives 
            finally being taken by the European Commission and other interested 
            parties to reduce and perhaps one day eliminate the inadvertent slaughter 
            of dolphins, porpoises and pilot whales trapped in the nets of trawlers 
            operating in waters close to Scotland's coastline and elsewhere; is 
            convinced that Scottish fishermen will readily engage with scientists 
            and others in an effort to reduce dramatically this needless slaughter, 
            and believes that it has an important role to play in the implementation 
            of rules and regulations governing the use of whatever means are needed 
            to protect such important marine species.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3211</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Private Hire Vehicles 
            (Carriage of Guide Dogs etc.) Bill &#150; UK Legislation</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament endorses the principle of including in the Private 
            Hire Vehicles (Carriage of Guide Dogs etc.) Bill a power for Scottish 
            Ministers to regulate for the carriage of guide and other assistance 
            dogs in private hire cars in Scotland and agrees that the relevant 
            provisions to achieve this end in the Bill should be considered by 
            the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3210#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie: Causing Death 
            by Dangerous Driving</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the publication 
            of the report by the Transport Research Laboratory, <em>Road Safety 
            Research Report No.26, Dangerous Driving and the Law,</em> which examines 
            the use and application of the law on careless and dangerous driving 
            throughout the UK; supports the report where it states that in Scotland 
            a "clearer message regarding the seriousness of these offences would 
            be sent to both defendant and society if all causing death by dangerous 
            driving cases were tried in the High Court" rather than sheriff courts, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should (a) commission specific 
            Scottish research in this area to take on board the report&#146;s 
            conclusions and recommendations and (b) take the necessary steps to 
            ensure that dangerous driving offences are heard in the appropriate 
            court and not downgraded.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3209</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: University of St Andrews 
            (Postgraduate Medical Degrees) Bill &#150; Stage 3</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament agrees that the University of St Andrews (Postgraduate 
            Medical Degrees) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3208#</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Lanark Racecourse</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">welcomes the proposals for development 
            that would enable Lanark Racecourse to once again host first-class 
            horse racing events; commends the efforts of local individuals behind 
            such proposals and, in particular, Mr David Hughes; offers full cross-party 
            support to these endeavours which will greatly enhance the social 
            and economic regeneration of Lanark and the surrounding communities; 
            encourages the UK horse racing authorities to do all in their power 
            to enable the proposals to come to fruition, and looks forward to 
            the day when the race for the Silver Bell, the UK&#146;s oldest racing 
            trophy, is once more a regular fixture at Lanark.</a></p>
