            Partick Thistle on winning promotion from the Second Division of the

            are the first team in British senior football to win promotion this

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1821</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace 
            Elder: Close Paterson's Dump, Glasgow</strong>—That the Parliament calls 
            for the immediate closure of Paterson’s Dump at Baillieston and Mount 
            Vernon, Glasgow, to protect the public and the environment in the 
            light of the four enforcement notices served on Paterson’s by the 
            Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for failing to provide 
            relief for outraged local residents from the appalling smells and 
            for being unable to guarantee that the groundwater, which is close 
            to the River Clyde, was not being affected by the dump, which is licensed 
            to take arsenic, cyanide, asbestos and a total of 27 poisonous chemicals; 
            recalls that in November 1999, following a Public Health Department 
            investigation of the dump, Dr Harry Burns, Director of Public Health 
            for Greater Glasgow stated &quot;smells are, at times, literally breathtaking&quot;, 
            believes that, despite other attempts over the years, the continued 
            suffering of local people can only be alleviated by a total closure 
            of the dump, which is licensed to take up to 500,000 tonnes of waste 
            every year including sewage which is hauled through urban areas on 
            around 4,000 lorries; is deeply concerned that Paterson’s is the only 
            high level toxic dump still existing within a city boundary in Scotland 
            and that, after enduring the dump for 44 years, local people deserve 
            relief; is determined that the East End of Glasgow should not remain 
            a dumping ground for materials which many other areas will not accept; 
            does not approve of the continuing profits being made by the dump’s 
            owners while local tenants and council tax payers are subjected to 
            misery and restrictions on the enjoyment of their homes, and therefore 
            calls upon SEPA to remove Paterson’s licence and enforce closure of 
            the dump immediately and thereby uphold their claim to be protectors 
            of the public and the environment.</font></p>
