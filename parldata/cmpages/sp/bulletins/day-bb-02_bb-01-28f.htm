          <p><strong>*S1M-2648</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Jobs Announcements 
            for Fife Economy</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the jobs boost 
            to Fife's economy following the announcements that RAF Leuchars is 
            set to expand with a new squadron stationed at the base and that the 
            Child Support Agency is to create over 200 jobs in Kirkcaldy at a 
            site that will handle claims from both Scotland and England.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2647</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Rail 
            Link to Edinburgh Airport</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            the Strategic Rail Authority's 10-year plan includes a study into 
            potential improvements in rail access to Scottish airports and that 
            in Edinburgh options range from a new airport station on the nearby 
            main rail route, with a shuttle into the airport, to a new tunnelled 
            main line and station under the heart of the airport; further notes 
            that either station could provide for further integration and stimulate 
            economic activity, and, in the light of the recent decision by Her 
            Majesty's Government to place Railtrack into administration which 
            has cast considerable doubt and uncertainty on the willingness of 
            the private sector to fund such investment, calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to outline how such a link could be financed in the best 
            interests of Edinburgh and Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David McLetchie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2646#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Secondary 
            Schools Staffing Levels</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the decision of Glasgow City Council to introduce a new method of 
            calculating staffing levels at secondary schools in Glasgow involving 
            staffing schools on an average pupil roll across the year whereby, 
            for example, if there are 800 pupils in August and a projected 750 
            in January following the departure of January school leavers the school 
            will be staffed for 775 pupils from August; notes that no other local 
            authority uses this practice; further notes that potentially 38 secondary 
            teaching posts could be lost as a result, and therefore considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should make urgent representations to 
            Glasgow City Council against introducing this method of calculating 
            staffing levels.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2645</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Fergusson Art Gallery</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates Perth and Kinross Council on its allocation 
            of £75,000 towards the preservation of a well-known local landmark, 
            the cast iron dome of the Fergusson Art Gallery in Perth, and calls 
            upon Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund to show a favourable 
            response to grant applications seeking to raise the additional funds 
            required to preserve this important building for future generations 
            to enjoy.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2644</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety: The Children's 
            Hearings (Legal Representation) (Scotland) Rules 2001</strong>-That 
            the Education, Culture and Sport Committee recommends that nothing 
            further be done under the Children's Hearings (Legal Representation) 
            (Scotland) Rules 2001 (SSI 2001/478).</p>
          <p>Supported by: Jackie Baillie</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2643</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety: The Curators

            that nothing further be done under the Panels of Persons to Safeguard 
            the Interests of Children (Scotland) Regulations 2001 (SSI 2001/476).</p>
          <p>Supported by: Jackie Baillie</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2641</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Death of John McGrath</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with regret and sadness the death of John McGrath; 
            believes that he made an enormous contribution to Scottish cultural 
            and political life, particularly through his work with the 7:84 Theatre 
            Company, and conveys its condolences to his family.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2640</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Recycling Target 
            for Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the Executive to 
            set a mandatory target for recycling or composting of 30% of household 
            waste by 2010.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2639</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Social Firms 
            Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the growing success 
            of Social Firms Scotland and the valuable role played by initiatives 
            throughout the country such as Square One, which is a Scottish Association 
            for Mental Health project, and Printability in Aberdeen which provide 
            people who have a history of health problems with training and employment 
            opportunities that may not otherwise be available; commends the many 
            service users and officials who dedicate their time to making these 
            charitable projects a success; believes that the provision of such 
            services greatly assists people in gaining the confidence and stability 
            that is required to lead normal lives, and urges local authorities 
            and the Scottish Executive to provide continued support for such initiatives</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2638</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Grandholm Bridge Closure, 
            Aberdeen</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continuing traffic 
            congestion in the north of Aberdeen; further notes the proposals from 
            Aberdeen City Council to address this congestion and the plan to close 
            Grandholm Bridge from July 2002, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to make representations to Aberdeen City Council to keep the Grandholm 
            Bridge open at least until the Western Peripheral Route is in operation.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2637#</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Scottish Agricultural 
            College, Auchincruive</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the 
            important contribution that the Scottish Agricultural College, Auchincruive, 
            formerly the West of Scotland Agricultural College, has made and continues 
            to make to the rural economy of Scotland; deplores the plans by the 
            Scottish Agricultural College to downgrade Auchincruive to a mere 
            delivery vehicle for education courses in association with Paisley 
            University; views with concern the prospective closure of Auchincruive 
            as a research and teaching facility if and when it amalgamates with 
            the University's Ayr campus, and considers that such a closure would 
            be detrimental to the economic development of Ayrshire and the south 
            of Scotland.</p>

            the Parliament notes the need to conserve, protect and exhibit the 
            Roman heritage of Scotland<strong>;</strong> expresses concern that 
            the Scottish Executive has given permission for part of Dere Street 
            to be used by four-wheel drive vehicles<strong>,</strong> which is 
            likely to lead to irreparable damage and loss of valuable artefacts<strong>,</strong> 
            and congratulates the Antonine Guard Organisation on its continuing 
            campaign on this and other matters such as the threat to the Cramond

          <p> <strong>S1M-2629</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Burns Cottage</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the difficulties faced by the Joint Board of 
            Management of Burns National Heritage Park which includes Burns Cottage 
            in Alloway in continuing to secure and protect the building and its 
            contents and in ensuring continued public access; agrees that the 
            Joint Board are responsible for a uniquely important site and for 
            artefacts of huge significance which provide the most important commemoration 
            and celebration of the poet to be found anywhere in the world, and 
            calls on all of Scotland, including the Scottish Executive, to take 
            every necessary step to assist the Joint Board in their vital task 
            and also to ensure that Robert Burns and his vision and values are

          <p> <strong>S1M-2628</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Scottish Borders 
            Education Meltdown</strong>-That the Parliament notes with great concern 
            that Scottish Borders Council has announced a further £7 million of 
            cuts which would result in (a) eliminating continuing education in 
            the Borders leading to the closure of community wings and centres, 
            including the Abbey Row Centre in Kelso which has 44 dependent organisations, 
            such as mother and toddler and pensioner groups, and the loss of 100 
            or more jobs; (b) the cessation of funding for 15 voluntary organisations 
            including Borders Womens Aid which will lose £50,000 of core funding 
            and Gala Youth Project which will lose £60,000; (c) the threatened 
            closure of the swimming pools at Jedburgh, Selkirk and Eyemouth, and 
            therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to enter into immediate 
            discussions with the Council administration with a view to providing 
            special borrowing in order that these swingeing cuts are reversed.</p>

            course in Audiology; recognises that at present there is no school 
            of audiology for Scotland; further recognises that there is a serious 
            lack of trained audiologists to implement the use of digital hearing 
            aid technology across Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive

            and implement this course.</p>
