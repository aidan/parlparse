<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1359</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Local Television</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ofcom on finding a means to deliver local television through Freeview to virtually every household across the United Kingdom; looks to the Department&nbsp;for Culture, Media and Sport to introduce a licence in the near future to enable the provision of local public service television to be offered in each area at digital switchover, and&nbsp;urges the Scottish Government&nbsp;to consider how&nbsp;it can support the establishment of local public service television throughout Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1358</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Illiterate Woman Sentenced to Death in Saudi Arabia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with considerable concern the decision of a court in Saudi Arabia to condemn to death an illiterate woman, Fawza Falih, convicted of witchcraft; supports the calls of Human Rights Watch to King Abdullah to halt the execution and its belief that the conviction of Fawza Falih for witchcraft is a travesty of justice and reveals severe shortcomings in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s justice system, and continues to call on government at all levels in the United Kingdom to use its diplomatic influence to promote equal rights and democracy in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1357</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to City of Edinburgh Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the vital role that community centres play throughout Scotland both as a resource for local residents and as a means of social inclusion; commends the excellent service provided to hundreds of regular users by the staff of Burdiehouse and Southhouse Community Centre in Edinburgh despite the poor condition of their current building, and congratulates City of Edinburgh Council on its commitment to press ahead with a vital new facility despite the increased costs entailed through the withdrawal of the original developer.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1356</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Nursery Cuts Must Stop</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the SNP/Liberal Democrats&rsquo; decision to cut 320 full-time nursery places in the Edinburgh City Council area; believes that changes to the allocation criteria for nursery places will affect some of the most vulnerable parents and families across Edinburgh, particularly those with additional support needs and for whom English is a second language; further believes that taking the power to allocate nursery places away from nursery headteachers and allocating places on a term-by-term basis centrally is already deterring parents from trying to get back into work or undertaking further study; considers that these new measures are just another obstacle for families trying to work their way out of poverty; hopes that opposition politicians will be successful in reinstating some elements of fairness and social justice to the city budget, and ultimately believes that the value of nursery education is too important to play politics and balance budgets with.</p>
<p>Supported by: Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong>, Dr Richard Simpson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1355</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Portobello For a New School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the children, parents and community of Portobello need a new high school; congratulates everyone involved in producing the Portobello For A New School campaign DVD which can be viewed on YouTube; understands that council leaders say that they need more money from the Scottish Government and the Scottish Government says that the council has all the money that it is going to get; believes that SNP and Lib Dem councillors and the SNP government should stop passing the buck and start taking responsibility for delivering the new school which is so desperately needed; believes that the SNP promised that it would match Labour &quot;brick for brick&quot; and that those bricks included new Portobello, Boroughmuir and James Gillespie&rsquo;s high schools as well as new primary schools for St Crispin&rsquo;s and St John&rsquo;s, and encourages all those involved in campaigns for new schools to keep up their efforts.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1354</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Reflecting on 40 Years of US Military Justice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that next month will mark the 40th anniversary of the My Lai massacre in Vietnam when between 350 and 500 Vietnamese civilians, the majority of them women and children, were shot dead by US troops who launched a deliberate and unprovoked attack on the village of My Lai; notes the international condemnation of this atrocity and war crime when this incident finally reached the public domain nearly 18 months later; notes that the US forces&rsquo; commanding officer Captain Ernest Medina who allegedly planned, ordered and carried out the massacre was subsequently acquitted by US military authorities and that Lieutenant William Calley served only three and a half years under house arrest despite being found guilty by a US court martial of taking a leading role in the massacre; contrasts that to the trials of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay who have already served several years of torture, interrogation and detainment and now face a series of US military tribunals, a process involving questionable prospects of a fair trial and in which even the American Bar Association, representing US attorneys, refuses to participate, and believes that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the charges made against the detainees, in true democracies only the application of law through an open, accountable and truly independent judicial process awards the right to claim authority and leadership in a cynical world increasingly torn apart by conflict, war and terrorism.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1352#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>New Energy Strategy for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that it is time for a new approach to national energy strategy giving due regard to Scotland&rsquo;s landscape; notes that a new renewable energy policy should incorporate criteria which define the type of landscape within which modern wind turbines can be accommodated and new guidelines setting out where it is appropriate and not appropriate to site a wind farm; understands that such guidelines are needed to end the numerous and speculative applications being submitted and threatening scenic areas and local economies in mid-Scotland and Fife and throughout Scotland; believes that large-scale wind farm projects which face local opposition should not be approved until a new energy strategy is put in place; further understands that Scotland&rsquo;s landscape is a resource of outstanding value to outdoor recreation, tourism and the wider economy, and welcomes the John Muir Trust, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland, the Scottish Wild Land Group, the Mountaineering Council of Scotland and the Ramblers&rsquo; Association Scotland calling for a new energy strategy.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1347</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Violence Against Betting Shop Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the increase in physical and verbal abuse and intimidation faced by betting shop workers and the parallel rise in violent betting shop robberies; recognises that many workers do not receive adequate support from their employers following such traumatic incidents; regrets that the prevalence of workplace violence leads to a culture among employees, many of whom are lone female workers, of viewing such abuse as part of the job; acknowledges the work carried out by the trade union, Community, in challenging the problems of violence faced by its members in betting shops across Scotland, and welcomes the safety poster launch on 21 February 2008 in the Parliament to further raise awareness of Community&rsquo;s campaign to stop violence against betting shop workers.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1343#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Domestic Violence and Alcohol</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the link between the over-consumption of alcohol and a rise in domestic violence, illustrated by figures showing that 60% of all domestic abuse cases reported to Strathclyde Police between April and December 2007 were alcohol related; welcomes the important work to tackle domestic abuse undertaken by the present and previous administrations; further welcomes the commitment by Strathclyde&rsquo;s new chief constable, Stephen House, to promote a more rigorous approach to ending domestic violence, such as removing the offender rather than the victim from the family unit, and hopes that these achievements can be strengthened and built on to bring an end to the terrible suffering of the victims of domestic abuse.</p>
