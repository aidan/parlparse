          <p><strong>*S2M-1459</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Improvement 
            in Scottish Small Business Sector</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the publication of the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland 
            membership survey, <em>Lifting Barriers to Growth in UK Small Businesses 
            2004</em>, in particular the findings that 58% of its members had 
            experienced an increase in turnover in the past 12 months, that nearly 
            a third have increased their number of employees, that there has been 
            a rapid rise in uptake of broadband from 3% in 2002 to 21% in 2003 
            and an increase in the number of women who own a small business and 
            that more than half expect their business to grow within the next 
            two years and, furthermore, supports the work of the Scottish Executive, 
            Scottish Enterprise and the Business Gateways in helping small businesses 
            to achieve growth.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1458</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Call 
            for Resignation of Scottish Opera Chairman, Duncan McGhie</strong>-That 
            the Parliament supports the chorus of Scottish Opera and the union, 
            Equity, in their fight to retain jobs for singers in Scotland and 
            believes that the chairman of Scottish Opera, Duncan McGhie, who has 
            failed to ensure that the company spends according to its income, 
            failed to ensure the continuity of productions and failed to retain 
            jobs for his staff, should resign.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1457#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 
            Marriage Counselling Service - Couple Counselling Scotland</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the excellent work done by Glasgow Marriage 
            Counselling Service (GMCS) in association with Couple Counselling 
            Scotland; notes, in particular, their expertise and involvement with 
            families where children are drawn into partnership dysfunction that 
            requires the assistance of well-trained couple counsellors; is aware 
            that training costs around £5,500 per counsellor, of which £3,500 
            is paid by counsellors who later give their time on a voluntary basis; 
            is astonished that such an essential service to families which is 
            in line with the principles set out in the Scottish Executive consultation 
            paper, <em>Family Matters: Improving Family Law in Scotland</em>, 
            does not have direct funding and depends on varying levels of support 
            for such services from local authorities, and notes with concern that 
            one local authority has indicated its intention to reduce substantially 
            their vital support of GMCS with attendant consequences for the service.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1456#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Scottish Nappy Company for Winning a Scottish Business in the Community 
            Award</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Nappy Company 
            was presented with an Award for Excellence at the Scottish Business 
            in the Community celebration dinner on 3 June 2004; commends the excellent 
            service that companies like the Scottish Nappy Company offer to parents 
            in Scotland who are seeking an uncomplicated and inexpensive means 
            to reuse cotton nappies; recognises that, on average, 60% of a disposable 
            nappy is non-biodegradable and that their usage creates 1,000,000 
            tonnes of waste in Great Britain every year, much of it ending up 
            in landfill, and recognises that reusable cotton nappies provide a 
            practical and environmentally-sustainable alternative to disposable 
            nappies.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1455</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>The 
            Scottish Outdoor Access Code: Proposed Code (SE/2004/101)</strong>-That 
            the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the Scottish Outdoor Access 
            Code: Proposed Code (SE/2004/101) be approved.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1454</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Dalziel 
            High School, Motherwell</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Dalziel High School in Motherwell on the success of its development 
            and marketing of the school's own-label healthy options of low-fat 
            and low-salt potato crisps and bottled water; believes that this enterprise 
            is a fine example of the entrepreneurial spirit of Scotland's young 
            people and potentially a positive step in the battle to provide healthy 
            eating options for our young people, and calls for similar projects 
            to be explored and instigated by Scotland's other local authorities.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1453</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Parkhead 
            Citizens Advice Bureau</strong>-That the Parliament regrets Glasgow 
            City Council's decision to award Parkhead Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) 
            only £65,969 of the £104,845 requested in the service level agreement 
            that was submitted for the running of core services; notes that this 
            will result in a 40% reduction in Parkhead CAB's service to clients 
            and will have a significant impact on the lives of people within the 
            east end of Glasgow; further notes that last year the bureau assisted 
            with over 7,000 client contacts and over 10,000 problems, formally 
            represented over 300 clients at tribunals and in the Sheriff Court 
            and secured over £830,000 in financial gain for clients; is extremely 
            concerned that other Glasgow citizen's advice bureaux and advice providers 
            are facing problems in securing funding for their valuable services, 
            and therefore urges Glasgow City Council to increase substantially 
            Parkhead CAB's grant to allow the bureau to continue to operate at 
            its current level of service.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1452</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Homeless 
            World Cup 2004</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Jamie Shearer, 
            Kevin Short, Robert Cairney, David Duke, Gary Kimmet, Eddie O'Neill, 
            Owen Turner, Phil Garden, Shawn Schofield, Thomas Comrie, Mark Elliot 
            and John McAnnany who have been selected to represent Scotland in 
            the Homeless World Cup which will be staged in Gothenburg, Sweden 
            in July 2004; regrets, furthermore, that last year our magnificent 
            team, who picked up a trophy in their group, were not given the send 
            off, media coverage or welcome that they deserve and hopes that the 
            Parliament will attempt to rectify that shortfall this year by getting 
            behind our boys and actively promoting them; further notes that the 
            Homeless World Cup team is not only a successful and winning team, 
            but is also an example of huge triumph over often extreme difficulty 
            and to this end deserves the support, encouragement and praise of 
            the Parliament, and calls on the Minister for Tourism, Culture and 
            Sport to work with the Minister for Finance and Public Services in 
            order to find funding to assist the cash-strapped team.</P>
