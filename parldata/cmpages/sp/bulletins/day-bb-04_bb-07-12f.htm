          <p><strong>*S2M-1577</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Princess 
            Anne's Visit to Gibraltar</strong>-That the Parliament commends Princess 
            Anne's welcome and successful visit to Gibraltar in June 2004 and 
            urges the First Minister, in his role as a Privy Councillor, to encourage 
            Her Majesty the Queen to visit Gibraltar for the first time since 
            her visit of 50 years ago.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1576</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Cancer 
            Patients &amp; Unclaimed Benefits</strong>-That the Parliament strongly 
            congratulates Macmillan Cancer Relief on funding financial advice 
            and support for cancer patients in Scotland; is concerned that 64% 
            of cancer sufferers in Scotland do not claim the benefits to which 
            they are entitled, amounting to almost £15 million in unclaimed benefits; 
            considers it a disgrace that the benefit system is so confusing and 
            hostile that charitable organisations have to fund guidance on claiming 
            for cancer sufferers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take 
            swift action to guarantee that those people in Scotland who suffer 
            from cancer receive the full support to which they are entitled and 
            to make immediate and strong representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            in support of simplifying the benefits system for people diagnosed 
            with serious illnesses.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1575</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Stirling 
            - The Worst Local Roads in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that the recent Scottish road condition survey for 2003-04, carried 
            out by consultant engineers for the Society of Chief Officers of Transport 
            in Scotland using the latest laser technology on more than 10,000 
            miles of A, B and C roads, established an accurate and objective audit 
            of the state of Scotland's local road network; notes that Stirling 
            was found to have the worst roads in Scotland with almost two-thirds 
            requiring either immediate repair or further investigation; notes 
            from the research submitted in November 2003 by the AA Motoring Trust 
            to the Local Government and Transport Committee on roads maintenance 
            expenditure in Scotland that Stirling Council spent £5.1 million less 
            on its local roads network from 2001 to 2003 than it received in central 
            government grant, in contrast to the majority of Scottish councils 
            which spent more than they received; further notes that the council's 
            own scrutiny group published research in February 2003 showing that 
            £9.8 million would have been invested in local roads had the local 
            authority and its predecessor Central Region spent their full allocation 
            from central government over the previous six years; acknowledges 
            that Stirling's current Labour administration has consistently rejected 
            alternative budget proposals to spend more on roads; believes that 
            Stirling Council has neglected its responsibility to maintain Stirling's 
            roads to a proper standard, and calls on the Scottish Executive to 
            communicate to Scottish local authorities, such as Stirling Council's 
            Labour administration, the seriousness of the problems that can result 
            from failing to spend residents' and drivers' taxes on the proper 
            maintenance of local roads.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1574#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Camcorder Guerillas</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Camcorder Guerillas for the production of &quot;Welcome&quot;, a film 
            depicting the plight of asylum seekers in Glasgow who due to government 
            policy are made homeless; notes that Glasgow City Council, whilst 
            evicting asylum seekers from their homes, currently receives funding 
            from the Home Office for houses earmarked for asylum seekers which 
            in many cases are lying empty, and believes that, on humanitarian 
            grounds, the Scottish Executive should enter into talks with the Home 
            Office and Glasgow City Council to put an end to the practice of making 
            asylum seekers homeless and take full responsibility for asylum seekers 
            who are on Scottish soil.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1573</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Smoking 
            Deaths per Constituency</strong>-That the Parliament notes the high 
            mortality rates attributable to smoking in every constituency throughout 
            Scotland; further notes with concern the wide variance between constituencies 
            and, in particular, the effect that smoking has on mortality rates 
            in the west of Scotland and Glasgow, and urges all members, particularly 
            those from the most badly-affected areas, to appreciate the deaths 
            and illness caused by both primary and secondary smoking and to take 
            the first possible opportunity to vote for legislation that will assist 
            in reducing these horrific figures, thereby helping to create a more 
            equal society for all the people of Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1572</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The 
            Unclaimed Millions</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the research 
            commissioned by Macmillan Cancer Relief into the extent of unclaimed 
            disability living allowance by people with a terminal diagnosis of 
            cancer, undertaken by the Centre for Economics of Health at the University 
            of Wales, Bangor; notes with concern the figures that show that 64% 
            of people with terminal cancer in Scotland did not claim, amounting 
            to nearly £15 million unclaimed and affecting 9,783 people; notes 
            also that many others living long term with cancer are also eligible 
            for benefit so the true amount going unclaimed, and the number of 
            people affected, is much higher; further notes that Scotland has the 
            lowest claim rate in the whole of the United Kingdom and that someone 
            in Scotland with cancer is twice as likely not to claim benefit as 
            someone in Wales and almost three times as likely not to claim as 
            someone in Northern Ireland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to 
            improve the targeting of funds to ensure that this vulnerable group 
            receive the access to benefits they are entitled to and, further, 
            to work with local NHS boards to introduce measures to address patients' 
            financial concerns.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1571</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Queen 
            Victoria School Appeal</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Queen Victoria School in Dunblane and recognises its success as the 
            only school of its type in Scotland to fill the role for which it 
            was founded, providing high quality education in a stable environment 
            for the sons and daughters of members of all three services, and additionally 
            in making its facilities available to young persons' organisations, 
            including the National Youth Orchestras of Scotland; wishes the school 
            every success with its £2.5 million appeal as it approaches its centenary 
            celebrations in 2008, and welcomes plans to mark the centenary with 
            the building of an auditorium, suitable for assembly, musical and 
            theatrical performances and to be made available to other groups and 
            to the local community for public performances and conferences, which 
            will be the visible symbol of the gratitude of the school's supporters 
            for the sacrifices of servicemen and woman during the past hundred 
            years, just as the foundation of the school was a tribute to the soldiers 
            and sailors killed in the South African wars.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1570</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Scotland's 
            Regiments</strong>-That the Parliament notes with pride and admiration 
            the professionalism of the British Army's Scottish regiments in both 
            their historical and current roles; notes with concern reports that 
            treasury-forced cuts in defence spending may lead to the amalgamation 
            of all of Scotland's regiments; believes that such savage cuts would 
            lead to severe difficulties in recruitment in Scotland; further believes 
            that the prospect of such cuts to Britain's already stretched armed 
            forces at a time of global insecurity when peacekeeping operations 
            are essential is reckless; condemns any decision that would see any 
            of Scotland's historic regiments disappear, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to make clear to Her Majesty's Government the very strong 
            opposition throughout Scotland to any such cuts to the Scottish regiments.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1569</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>World 
            Heritage Site for St. Kilda</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Scottish Executive, Scottish Natural Heritage, the National Trust 
            for Scotland and other bodies involved in securing extension of St. 
            Kilda's World Heritage Site status to the marine environment; notes 
            that decisions on cultural heritage aspects of the site have been 
            deferred pending comparative studies and notes the difficulty of conducting 
            such studies given the archipelago's uniqueness, and calls on the 
            Executive to act to ensure that all Scotland's marine environment 
            receives appropriate levels of protection, starting with the creation 
            of a department of marine affairs with a dedicated minister.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1568</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Competitive 
            Sport for Children</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Portugal 
            on hosting such a memorable and successful European Football Championships; 
            further congratulates Greece on its victory in the tournament; notes 
            that Greece has a population of just over 10 million people but has 
            2 million football players of all ages actively participating in official 
            competitions of every kind; is concerned at reports that Edinburgh, 
            Glasgow, Dundee, North Lanarkshire, Fife, Aberdeen and Falkirk local 
            authorities have introduced the &quot;potted&quot; sports system that 
            prevents children from losing in sporting competitions; supports comments 
            by rugby legend, John Jeffrey, that Scotland has to encourage a winning 
            culture if we want to have any success on the international sporting 
            stage; further supports the comments of Olympic bronze medallist, 
            Yvonne Murray, that she learnt more from losing than winning, and 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that all children of all 
            ages in Scotland are given access to competitive sports and the opportunity 
            to learn from the experiences of winning and losing.</P>

          <p><strong>*S2M-1566</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Care 
            Home Funding in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the 
            difference between what local authorities pay to private care homes 
            and what the actual cost per person, per week amounts to is an average 
            of £71 per person, per week across Scotland; further notes that the 
            cost to the taxpayer of care in council residential homes is some 
            £200 per person, per week, more than is received by the private care 
            homes from the same local authorities; acknowledges that private care 
            homes cannot be expected to provide care at less than the actual cost 
            and are therefore forced to charge top-up fees; further acknowledges 
            that independent care homes cannot bring forward improvements with 
            such inequitable funding; recognises that private homes care for some 
            26,000 elderly people in long-term care in Scotland and employ a work 
            force of 50,000, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review funding 
            for all care homes in Scotland and ensure that there is a fairer solution.</P>

            Academy on taking second place in the Northern Open Rock Challenge 
            Final with its &quot;Maid in Scotland&quot; production and for being 
            excellent ambassadors for Scotland while attending the final in Grimsby; 
            notes the excellent work undertaken by the Be Your Best Foundation 
            in organising the 2004 Rock Challenge for school students, allowing 
            them to use and develop music, dance, drama and production skills 
            with the aim of encouraging young people to maintain a healthy lifestyle 
            by making a commitment not to take drugs and avoid drinking and smoking; 
            further notes that there is only one event of this nature in Scotland

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1564</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Smoking 
            in Pubs</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the people best 
            placed to know how to run their pubs and to assess how to accommodate 
            and meet their customers' needs most appropriately are the local landlords; 
            believes that a ban on smoking in pubs would be illiberal and would 
            remove the right of millions of law-abiding people to enjoy a relaxing 
            drink and smoke in their local pubs; believes that a smoking ban would 
            have a seriously detrimental effect on the licensed trade; understands 
            that many staff who work in pubs smoke themselves; notes that a number 
            of smaller country pubs do not actually employ any staff at all; recognises 
            that people considering working in pubs make that choice knowing that 
            they may well encounter smoky atmospheres at work; further recognises 
            that people going into pubs for social purposes make that same choice; 
            believes that preventing people from smoking in pubs in order to protect 
            those who work in pubs, who may be smokers themselves anyway, is inconsistent 
            with, for example, allowing people to work down coal mines and with 
            chemicals; believes that, if there is a demand for non-smoking pubs 
            or pubs which have both smoking and non-smoking areas, the free market 
            would deliver such establishments, and therefore totally rejects the 
            idea of a ban on smoking in pubs, believing that it is the responsibility 
            of pub landlords to decide what kind of establishment they wish to 
            run, having due regard to their customers and staff.</P>

            <strong>Clear Labelling for Scotch Beef</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the<strong> </strong>confirmation of the new rules governing 
            Protected Geographic Indicator status for Scotch beef through the 
            European Commission's Official Journal on 1 July 2004; recognises 
            that these rules will ensure that any beef labelled as Scotch must 
            be sourced from cattle that are born, bred and slaughtered in Scotland 
            and have been reared exclusively through farm assurance schemes; congratulates 
            Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) on its continuing hard work in promoting 
            Scotch beef and believes that this decision can only assist QMS in 
            further promoting Scotch beef worldwide, and agrees with NFU Scotland 
            that this decision will protect and enhance the integrity of the world-leading 
            Scotch beef brand in the face of an even more market-oriented environment 
            by showing the value and strength of Scottish farm assurance schemes.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1562</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Physiotherapy 
            Week 2004</strong>-That the Parliament notes Physiotherapy Week 2004 
            from 5 to 9 July; believes that physiotherapy is extremely important 
            in helping people of all ages to overcome injuries and resume their 
            regular lives as quickly as possible; further believes that physiotherapy 
            also plays a vital role in terms of assisting those with physical 
            disabilities to live their lives confidently; recognises the pressures 
            and demands placed on the service that are being exacerbated in some 
            areas by shortages; believes that action should be taken to ensure 
            that more people enter the profession, alleviating pressures on those 
            physiotherapists currently practicing and ensuring that the highest 
            standards are attained throughout Scotland, and congratulates the 
            physiotherapists of Scotland for all their hard work in this regard.</P>
