<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2755</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>New Lanark World Heritage Site</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the educational, historical and economic importance of New Lanark World Heritage Site as one of Scotland&rsquo;s top attraction sites, which receives over 400,000 visitors each year; recognises the excellent work carried out by the New Lanark Trust in achieving world heritage site status in 2001 following the restoration and development of the New Lanark village, building on the principles of philanthropist Robert Owen&rsquo;s own campaign for a fairer and better society; further recognises the importance of the trust&rsquo;s work not only in preserving New Lanark as a sustainable community with a resident population, but also in creating new opportunities for employment; deeply regrets the recent lack of grant money available on which the trust has been so reliant in previous years; recognises the potential threat this poses for the future of the trust&rsquo;s work in the continued development of the site, and calls on the Scottish Government to take the steps necessary to safeguard the future of this educationally, historically and economically vital world heritage site.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2754</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Save Sheuchan Street Postal Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the decision taken by Post Office Ltd to remain committed to its original post office branch closure programme across the South of Scotland despite the numerous strong objections made by individuals, businesses and community groups; further deplores the loss in particular of Sheuchan Street Post Office in Stranraer; notes with deep concern the detrimental impact that this loss of service provision in Stranraer will have on the economy of the immediate local community and surrounding area, individuals and small to medium-sized businesses reliant upon a service that is very localised and customised to their specific needs and that provides face-to-face personal support and advice to elderly, disabled and vulnerable people, and calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent action to retain effective and comprehensive postal services in Stranraer and the rest of the South of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2753</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the decision taken by Post Office Ltd to remain committed to its original post office branch closure programme across the South of Scotland despite the numerous strong objections made by individuals, businesses and community groups; further deplores the loss in particular of Greenlaw Post Office, which was shown to be a thriving and profitable business; notes with deep concern the detrimental impact that this loss of service provision in Greenlaw will have on the economy of the immediate local community and surrounding area, individuals and small to medium-sized businesses reliant upon a service that is very localised and customised to their specific needs and that provides face-to-face personal support and advice to elderly, disabled and vulnerable people, and calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent action to retain effective and comprehensive postal services in Greenlaw and the rest of the South of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2752</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Shawlands Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff and pupils at Shawlands Academy on Glasgow&rsquo;s Southside for their award as the United Kingdom&rsquo;s greenest school; notes that the school fought off competition from schools throughout Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland; recognises the contribution that schools can make both to direct environmental improvements and to fostering a lasting culture of sustainable living; considers that many parts of the public sector can learn from the examples shown by Shawlands Academy and the other schools in the competition, and urges the Scottish Government to use the forthcoming climate change bill to provide incentives for urgent action throughout Scotland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of environmental damage.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2751</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Bank Bonuses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with dismay that both Northern Rock and Lloyds TSB have indicated that they will pay out senior staff bonuses this year; regards this to be an unacceptable practice after being in receipt of billions of pounds of taxpayers&rsquo; money to ensure that they could continue trading; is of the view that no bank that has received such public money should even contemplate the paying of bonuses to senior staff; believes that to do so will be viewed as a calculated insult to the millions of people now facing a recession with the potential loss of their homes and jobs, and would expect that the bank chiefs will reconsider their position on this as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2750</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Shetland Times Petition on Airline Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that airlines are adding extra charges to their basic ticket prices; further notes that such extra charges often include the use of debit and credit cards and seat reservations; is concerned that such charges often seem to bear very little relationship to the actual costs that the airlines face and that such extra charges have been imposed on the air services between Shetland and the UK mainland; understands the concerns that this has raised and believes that there should be no charge for using a debit card or for reserving a seat and that the charges applied to credit cards should reflect the actual cost to the airline, and congratulates <em>Shetland Times</em> on its petition campaign to see seat reservation and debit card charges dropped and credit card charges lowered.</p>
