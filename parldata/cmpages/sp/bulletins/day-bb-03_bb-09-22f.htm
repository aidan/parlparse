          <P><strong>*S2M-368#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>National 
            Concessionary Travel Scheme for Older People</strong>-That the Parliament 
            acknowledges the importance of affordable public transport to the 
            quality of life of older people in every part of Scotland and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should introduce a national concessionary 
            travel scheme which includes bus, rail, ferry and air services.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-367#</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Congestion 
            Charging</strong>-That the Parliament considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should reject the congestion charging scheme if submitted 
            to it in its current form by the City of Edinburgh Council for approval, 
            as the scheme discriminates against residents of Midlothian, West 
            Lothian and surrounding areas commuting to Edinburgh for employment 
            purposes and will result in such residents paying disproportionately 
            for Edinburgh's transport problem without commensurate improvement 
            in public transport in Midlothian, West Lothian and surrounding areas.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-366</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Traditional Music Awards</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 
            establishment of the annual Scottish traditional music awards; congratulates 
            all winners at the inaugural event which took place on 13 September 
            2003 in Edinburgh; notes in particular the posthumous award to Hamish 
            Henderson for his outstanding contribution to Scottish culture, and 
            appreciates the attendance of the Minister for Tourism, Culture and 
            Sport at this important celebration of contemporary Scottish music.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-365#</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh's 
            Proposals for Congestion Charging</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that the draft congestion charging scheme approved by the City of 
            Edinburgh Council proposes to exempt Edinburgh residents who live 
            outwith the proposed outer cordon from paying a congestion charge, 
            whilst still proposing to levy a charge on residents of other local 
            authorities; believes that such a proposal is discriminatory and unfair, 
            thus failing to meet the requirement of "fair treatment" emphasised 
            by the Scottish Executive in giving approval in principle to a charging 
            scheme, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            reject any subsequent proposal from the City of Edinburgh Council 
            which is based on this form of charging regime.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-364#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Children's 
            Panel Membership</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the huge 
            contribution made to public life by volunteers; notes that the children's 
            hearing system has now been in operation in Scotland for over 30 years; 
            applauds the dedication and commitment of children's panel members 
            in undertaking a difficult and demanding task; recognises the Scottish 
            Executive's current recruitment campaign for additional panel members, 
            and encourages people from all sections of the community, but in particular 
            men, to consider applying for membership of the children's panel in 
            their local area.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-363</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Hi-Arts 
            Broadband Britain Challenge Award</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Hi-Arts on winning the public sector category of the Broadband Britain 
            Challenge Awards; notes the diversity of the arts and their pivotal 
            role in our cultural identity and our economy, and welcomes the potential 
            that broadband offers to offset some of the difficulties faced by 
            arts makers and other small businesses in remote and rural areas and 
            thereby support sustainable development in those areas.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-362</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Tartan 
            Day, Paris, 4 April 2004</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Tartan 
            Day is now celebrated in France as well as in the United States of 
            America and urges the First Minister to attend the Tartan Day celebrations 
            in Paris on 4 April 2004, thereby cementing the Auld Alliance and 
            our historic and ongoing friendship with Old Europe.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-361#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Lack 
            of Affordable Rural Housing in North East Scotland</strong>-That the 
            Parliament is concerned by the lack of affordable housing available 
            for renting or buying in rural communities in the north east and elsewhere 
            in the country; notes that in Aberdeenshire alone 6000 households 
            await suitable housing; further notes that local people are often 
            priced out of their own communities due to the rising and exorbitant 
            cost of property and land, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should bring forward radical and innovative measures to address those 
            issues at the root of this situation such as a review of planning 
            regimes, diversification of land ownership, appropriate funding mechanisms 
            and the need for more compulsory purchase orders.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-360#</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Open 
            Source Software</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the SNP 
            Members of the European Parliament, their colleagues in the Green/European 
            Free Alliance group and, in particular, Prof Neil MacCormick MEP for 
            being at the forefront of the campaign in the European Parliament 
            to defend the interests of the open-source software industry; notes 
            that a number of public bodies across Europe have switched to open 
            source software systems; further notes that the SNP group in the European 
            Parliament has called on the EU institutions to look into switching 
            to open source software, and considers that the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body should investigate the feasibility of the Parliament 
            making greater use of such software with a view to switching to open 
            source software in the future.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-359#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Availability 
            of Organ Donor Forms</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned that 
            the scheme to include organ donor forms with voter registration forms 
            has been halted; believes that the scheme is a successful way of recruiting 
            badly-needed new donors as demonstrated by Dundee City Council, the 
            only Scottish local authority that took part in the scheme, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should enter into discussions with the 
            Electoral Commission and Her Majesty's Government in order to try 
            to resolve any legal difficulties involved in the interpretation of 
            the Representation of the People (Amendment) Regulations 2002.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-358</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>Dr 
            Henry Faulds - Pioneer of Fingerprinting</strong>-That the Parliament 
            acknowledges the pioneering work carried out by Scotsman Dr Henry 
            Faulds in the scientific study of fingerprints; recognises that Dr 
            Faulds, who was born in Beith, Ayrshire, in 1843, first published 
            his findings on the forensic application of fingerprinting in the 
            Nature Magazine in 1880, some years ahead of contemporaries in the 
            field, and therefore should be recognised as the true pioneer of fingerprinting, 
            and acknowledges the work of the Dr Henry Faulds - Beith Commemorative 
            Society in seeking to recognise the work and achievements of Dr Faulds 
            by securing funds to provide a permanent memorial in the town.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-349</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Dedicated 
            Bus Service to St. Peter's Primary School, Edinburgh</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the agreement between the City of Edinburgh 
            Council and contractors to allow the refurbishment of St. Peter's 
            Primary School, Morningside, to start immediately; notes that the 
            lack of a dedicated school bus service for the current school year 
            to take pupils to their temporary school near Tollcross has caused 
            traffic congestion at this site and overcrowding on buses running 
            on the A702 into the city, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council 
            to introduce one immediately to stop travel problems for teachers, 
            pupils, parents and commuters.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-348#</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Transport 
            in Southern Edinburgh</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the continued traffic congestion on main routes into Edinburgh from 
            the south, including the problem of parking by city centre commuters 
            in residential streets in southern Edinburgh; further notes with concern 
            the proposal for an out-of-town football stadium at Straiton that 
            can only exacerbate existing traffic problems; considers that improved 
            transport infrastructure, such as the proposed park-and-ride site 
            at Burdiehouse, is essential to help tackle the problem, and considers 
            that the City of Edinburgh and Midlothian councils and the Scottish 
            Executive should ensure that these transport problems in southern 
            Edinburgh can be resolved with added benefit to the wider Lothian 
            and Borders region.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-347</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Redundancy 
            Notices at the National Library of Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament 
            condemns the redundancy notices to six senior heads of department 
            at the National Library of Scotland and regrets the fact that the 
            skills of the six most knowledgeable librarians in Scotland are potentially 
            to be lost to the nation.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-346</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Borders 
            Railway Funding</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the lodging 
            of the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill; notes that Stow is not to 
            be included as a stop, although the projected time for the journey 
            without that stop is now some 61 minutes from Galashiels to Edinburgh 
            when in 1954 the same journey took 49 minutes; is concerned that this 
            line requires to meet some, as yet unspecified, business case, a test 
            not put with regard to other announced rail, road or tram developments 
            and that accordingly no firm commitment has been given to this funding, 
            and asks the Scottish Executive to detail the criteria for this business 
            case now.</P>

            Referendum on Euro Membership</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the convincing result of the Swedish referendum on euro membership; 
            congratulates the people of Sweden for having the courage to vote 
            &quot;No&quot; to the euro in such large numbers against the weight 
            of the entire political, business and media establishment; agrees 
            with the Swedish people that joining the euro would not be in the 
            economic interests of Sweden and would have meant a substantial loss 
            of national sovereignty, and looks forward to Her Majesty's Government 
            calling a euro referendum here at the earliest opportunity in order 
            that the people of Scotland can demonstrate that their opposition 
            to the euro is every bit as strong as that of the Swedes.</P>

            whose aim, as stated by the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, 
            is to give birth to a European super state and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should apply pressure on Her Majesty's Government 
            to hold referenda on both the European constitution and the common 
            European currency at an early date in order that uncertainties within 
            the Scottish economy are removed in line with the democratic wishes

            through the Post Office should be able to continue to do so; considers 
            that the Communications Workers Union &quot;Banking on You&quot; campaign 
            highlights the need to better publicise the banking facilities that 
            Post Offices now offer; further considers that access to the Post 
            Office Card Account should be made easier, and believes that all major 
            banks including HSBC, HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland and Natwest should 
            be urged to sign up to universal banking by making all current accounts 
            available at Post Offices.</P>

            <strong>Respect for Shopworkers Day, 17 September 2003</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the level of violence and abuse 
            that shopworkers deal with on a daily basis; further notes the recent 
            survey by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied workers (USDAW) 
            that found that 47% of those responding to the survey reported physical 
            attacks or assaults on staff in the last 12 months, that 72% reported 
            staff being threatened with violence, that in one in four stores threats 
            are being made every week, that in one-third of stores verbal abuse 
            is a daily event, that almost 50% of staff have taken time off work 
            as a result of violence and that stress-related problems are common 
            and include sickness, insomnia, headaches and clinical depression; 
            commends the USDAW campaign, &quot;Freedom from Fear&quot;' and recognises 
            its main objectives as raising awareness of the level of violence 
            and abuse, making the workplace safer and protecting both shoppers 
            and staff, and supports &quot;Respect for Shopworkers Day&quot; on 
            17 September 2003 aimed at preventing abusive behaviour, highlighting 
            the support that retail companies can, and do, give their staff and 
            encouraging the public to show respect for shopworkers.</P>
