That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2847</strong> <strong>Richard Baker: Developing Marine Energy Technology</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ocean Power Delivery on signing an order to deliver three &ldquo;Pelamis&rdquo; wave-energy converters to Portugal as part of the world&rsquo;s first commercial wave farm; believes that this demonstrates the exciting potential of wave, tidal and marine energy; notes the substantial financial support, totalling over &pound;2 million, that the Scottish Executive has provided for the European Marine Energy Centre Ltd in Orkney that has helped make Scotland a world leader in this area, and believes that the incentives for the creation of marine energy schemes which are provided through the Renewables Obligation Certificates system are essential in stimulating the industry.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2846</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Edinburgh Airport Blueprint Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by BAA of a consultation on the long-term development blueprint for Edinburgh Airport; notes the importance of Edinburgh Airport to the local, regional and national economy, worth &pound;287 million for the Scottish economy and supporting 2,300 jobs directly and 5,000 indirectly; welcomes the improvements being made to the access arrangements with tram, heavy rail and improved roads, but calls on BAA, the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society and the Scottish Executive to investigate the opportunities for co-existence of the Royal Highland Showground and airport, given the society&rsquo;s willingness to give up significant quantities of land, cross-party support for co-existence and the considerable cost of relocation of the showground.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2845</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe: Wave Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ocean Power Delivery for the signing of the order to build the initial phase of the world&rsquo;s first commercial wave farm; notes that there are 14GW of potential wave energy, as well as 7.5GW of tidal energy, in Scotland&rsquo;s waters; regrets the UK Government&rsquo;s historical antipathy towards marine energy, lasting 20 years and more; regrets that in the last two years the UK Government&rsquo;s energy department has had four energy ministers, Malcolm Wicks, Mike O&rsquo;Brien, Stephen Timms and Brian Wilson and two name changes, from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to the Orwellian Department of Productivity, Energy and Industry and back again; further regrets the admission of the DTI that it will not achieve its 10% renewable energy target by 2010; notes the disparity between the &pound;50 million commitment of the DTI towards marine energy and the &pound;50 billion price bill for managing current levels of radioactive waste; regrets that the DTI appears to want more nuclear power while admitting that questions of finance, government support, market mechanisms, public support and storage of radioactive waste are still unanswered; supports the Scottish Executive in its efforts to promote renewable energy through the Forum for Renewable Energy Development (FREDS), the Marine Energy Test Centre in Orkney, the Renewables Obligation system and the 40% renewables target, and calls on the UK Government to embrace marine energy as a source of carbon-free electricity generation, worth potentially thousands of Scottish jobs and many millions of pounds of Scottish exports. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2844#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Ocean Power Delivery&rsquo;s Commercial Success and Scotland&rsquo;s Wave Energy Future</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ocean Power Delivery on securing the world&rsquo;s first commercial wave energy installation; believes that this breakthrough illustrates the enormous renewables expertise that exists in Scotland; notes that Ocean Power&rsquo;s device will be installed in Portuguese waters, rather than Scottish waters, due to the level of support for marine renewables offered by the Portuguese Government in contrast to the Scottish and UK Governments; recognises that Scotland possesses enormous marine renewables potential; regrets that the Scottish and UK Governments have failed to create an environment that would have attracted commercial wave developments in Scottish waters, despite the fact that the technology has been developed in Scotland, and believes that, if the Scottish and UK Governments do not get their act together, then renewables technology developed in Scotland will continue to meet the energy and environmental objectives of other countries before they benefit Scotland&rsquo;s.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2843</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell: Scottish Biodiversity Week, 21 to 29 May 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the huge range of activities scheduled for Scottish Biodiversity Week 2005; congratulates the numerous individuals and organisations participating, predominantly on a voluntary basis, on their enthusiasm; notes that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s 2004 Biodiversity Action Grants scheme was oversubscribed by over seven times and that in the last 50 years over 300,000 species globally have become extinct, while one-in-four mammal species and one-in-eight bird species face a high risk of extinction in the near future, and calls on the Executive to take the strongest possible lead to protect and promote biodiversity, both for its intrinsic merit, and for its inextricable link with quality of life, including economic development.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2842#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Make 2 July 2005 Free Transport Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the obscene reality of 30,000 human lives being prematurely snuffed out by poverty across our world each day; further recognises the opportunity presented to Scotland for a huge protest against such unnecessary and unacceptable poverty in a world as rich as ours on 2 July 2005 in Edinburgh at the Make Poverty History march and rally, and, to facilitate the maximum participation in this one-off opportunity for Scots to stand up in the name of the world&rsquo;s poor, considers that 2 July should be declared &ldquo;Free Transport Day&rdquo; to and from Edinburgh and the necessary arrangements made for trains, buses and ferries to be free for those travelling to the Make Poverty History demonstration on that day.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2841#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne: Powers of the Scottish Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the increased focus afforded specific groups within Scotland following the creation of the Parliament as a result of devolution; also notes the Parliament&rsquo;s inability to fully address the needs of groups such as senior citizens, and therefore believes that the time is now right to explore options for increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament to properly address the needs of all Scottish citizens.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2840#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner: Nurse Recruitment and Retention</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that, while some progress has been made in the recruitment of nursing staff in NHSScotland over recent years, the nursing workforce trend in Scotland is of continuing concern with growth at less than half that achieved in England over the period 1997 to 2004; recognises that there is a global nursing shortage and that in the United States of America, which is seeking to recruit an additional one million nurses over the next few years, nurse-patient ratios are increasingly viewed as the best way to both guarantee high standards of patient care and improve staff morale and retention, with the American Nurses&rsquo; Association leading a campaign in Congress for adequate and safe nursing numbers to be guaranteed in law; recognises that in a competitive world market Scotland has to ensure that it is offering the best possible incentives to recruit, retain and reward nurses, and believes that the Scottish Executive should examine options for legally guaranteeing safe nursing numbers in NHSScotland in order to help retain staff and ensure that patients know there will always be enough staff available to give them the standard of care that they require.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2839</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird: Ocean Power Delivery in Portugal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish company, Ocean Power Delivery, for securing contracts to develop the world&rsquo;s first commercial wave energy farm; is delighted that Scottish marine energy engineering has the potential to create thousands of jobs; notes the level of co-operation between investors, government and the private sector in taking this bold and exciting step; salutes the forward thinking and enthusiasm for this technology of the people and government of Portugal; is disappointed that the Scottish Executive has failed to take a lead in supporting the commercial development of offshore marine energy; wishes that this first commercial marine power development had happened off the coast of Scotland instead, and calls on the Executive to treble support to the industry so that Scotland catches up and secures a share of the employment and diversification potential for Scotland&rsquo;s engineering industry.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2838</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne: Congratulations to RHET Ayrshire and Arran Countryside Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Highland Education Trust (RHET) Ayrshire and Arran Countryside Initiative on the work it undertakes in rural education and on its recent exhibition at the Ayr County Show 2005; recognises the extremely valuable work that organisations such as this play in our rural communities and in the education of our young people, and applauds the hard work and foresight of the RHET and wishes it success in all its future projects.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2837</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard: Inquiry into Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Environment and Rural Development Committee on the publication of the report of its inquiry into climate change; welcomes the conclusions of the report, including the support for interim traffic reduction targets and improved home energy efficiency; echoes calls for the Scottish Executive to take radical action to tackle climate change, and calls on all MSPs to support cross-party efforts to address both the causes and the effects of climate change in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2836</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird: Wind Power in the UK</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), the UK Government&rsquo;s advisory body, on the publication of <em>Wind Power in the UK</em>, a report on the issues surrounding onshore wind power development; agrees with the SDC that wind power and other renewables are needed to secure a truly sustainable future for Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom; welcomes the findings of the SDC that wind power is both cost-effective and predictable enough to take the place of coal and gas-fired power stations in the medium term and that it is unlikely to need dedicated back-up; considers that a broad range of onshore and offshore renewable technologies, including wind, solar, biomass, wave and tidal wave, have the capacity and predictability to replace both conventional and nuclear power stations; further agrees that an expansion of renewables and improved energy efficiency have far greater capacity to tackle climate change than the inherently unsustainable nuclear industry; fully supports calls for communities to be involved in meaningful public consultation from an early stage in the development process and for them to share in the commercial benefits of wind power, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take a lead in pushing forward the expansion and development of all sustainable renewable technologies to fulfil Scotland&rsquo;s potential as a world leader in sustainable energy supply.</p>
