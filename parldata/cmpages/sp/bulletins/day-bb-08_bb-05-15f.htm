<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1910</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>National Staff Dismissal Register</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the establishment of a National Staff Dismissal Register by Action Against Business Crime; agrees with trade unions and civil liberties campaigners that the scheme has great potential for abuse as it allows unscrupulous employers to make unsubstantiated accusations that could devastate the lives of innocent people; further notes that victims of this scheme might be unaware that they had been blacklisted and would have no right of appeal, and therefore believes that in order to protect human rights the scheme should be scrapped immediately.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1909</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Cathy Wilkes Nominated for Turner Prize</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow-based artist Cathy Wilkes on being shortlisted for the Turner Prize; believes this will serve as inspiration to other modern artists across Scotland, and wishes all contenders for the prize well in the final round of judging.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1908</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Stirling - Scotland&rsquo;s Sporting Flagship</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the First Minister that the University of Stirling is to be recognised as Scotland&rsquo;s flagship institution for the practice, study, and research of sport; believes that the symbolic recognition of this status is as important as the award of &pound;600,000 through the Scottish Funding Council; recognises the excellent achievements already by the University of Stirling in developing world-class facilities for sports such as golf, tennis, swimming and football, as well as Scotland&rsquo;s first professorial Chair of Sports Policy; notes that the campus already hosts bases of the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland, the Scottish Institute of Sport, Scottish Swimming, Scottish Gymnastics, Tennis Scotland, Fitness Scotland, Triathlon Scotland and the Scottish Football Association; believes that developing a recognised specialism in this field to an elite level has the potential to propel the university and the city onto a world stage and further boost Scotland&rsquo;s national reputation globally, and in particular looks forward to the University of Stirling making an extensive and praiseworthy contribution to Scottish success at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1908.1</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Stirling - Scotland&rsquo;s Sporting Flagship</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1908) in the name of Keith Brown, insert at end &quot;and congratulates the First Minister on adopting this Labour manifesto commitment&quot;.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1906</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Better Policies for Giant Panda Conservation, Breeding and Welfare</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the proposal by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) to lease two giant pandas from a research centre in China for exhibition and captive breeding at Edinburgh Zoo; considers that there are serious animal welfare problems attached to the keeping of giant pandas in zoos; notes that captive breeding of giant pandas has resulted in no successful reintroduction to the wild; believes that the best way to conserve the giant panda population is to support in situ projects such as panda reserves and habitat conservation; urges the RZSS to reconsider this plan, and requests the Scottish and UK governments not to become involved in using live animals as currency in the course of diplomatic exchange.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1905</strong> <strong>Gavin Brown:</strong> <strong>10 Years of the South Edinburgh Echo</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>South Edinburgh Echo</em> on its 10th anniversary; applauds the hard work of the editor, Alex Schweitzer-Thompson, chairperson, Linda Wright, and all of the board as well as all the volunteers and previous staff whose dedication underpins the success of the paper; notes that the <em>Echo</em> is a focal point of the local community, playing an important role in promoting local events and highlighting achievements of local charities and organisations; believes that newspapers such as the <em>Echo</em> play a vital role across the south of Edinburgh, and further believes that the newspaper has a valuable role to play in the south of Edinburgh for many years to come.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1904</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Coca Cola Schools 7s Football Competition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Coca Cola schools 7s football competition and congratulates all teams taking part; believes that sport in schools should be open to all, regardless of race or religion; is therefore deeply concerned that Sgoil a&rsquo; Bhac in Lewis, who are due to play in the national final of this competition later this month, are in a situation where they may have to withdraw from the game for religious reasons because the final is, unlike in previous years, being held on a Sunday and the organisers say they are unable to be flexible, and calls on the organisers of the tournament to avert a situation in which a team in the final would be disqualified simply because of the religious traditions of the families from which they come.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1903</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Jeff Torrington</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament takes aff its bunnet and bids farewell to Jeff Torrington; remembers with fondness his wonderful novel <em>Swing Hammer Swing</em>, which won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award in 1992; recalls the clarity of style, wickedness of humour and sureness of pen which brought Glasgow to life in all its energetic complexity, and considers that the dark moving tale of Tam Clay placed him at the top table of Scottish contemporary writers and that this remarkable contribution to Scottish literature will be forever remembered.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1902.3</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Free Personal Care</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1902) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;and urges&quot; to end and insert &quot;however, also notes the decision of the UK Benefit Commissioners that continued payment of attendance allowance to self funders would have been a breach of the current benefit rules; further notes the UK Government&rsquo;s Wanless review&rsquo;s suggestion of the alignment of the benefits system, including attendance allowance, with funding for social care, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to enter into discussions with the UK Government, as part of the UK Government&rsquo;s review of social care, to ensure that Scotland receives a full and equitable share of the overall funds available for care of the elderly; urges the Scottish Government to undertake further work to re-assess all funding streams relevant to the care of the elderly and to come forward with proposals for the sustainable long-term funding of care of the elderly; notes that there is a funding gap in the current financial year, and calls on the Scottish Government to engage with COSLA immediately to achieve a resolution of the problem and report back to the Parliament before the summer recess.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1895</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Removing the Barriers to Microgeneration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication on 13 May 2008 of the Energy Saving Trust&rsquo;s report, <em>Generating the Future: An analysis of policy interventions to achieve widespread microgeneration penetration in Scotland</em>; notes the report&rsquo;s finding that, with the right policy support, microgeneration has the potential to deliver Scottish savings of 9.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2050; agrees with the report&rsquo;s authors that one of the barriers to wider microgeneration take-up at present is the requirement to apply for planning permission; notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on removing the requirement for planning permission for certain microgeneration installations ended on 12 May; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ambition to remove the barriers to microgeneration in Scotland, and is confident that the Scottish Government will take careful note of the responses submitted to the consultation.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1883</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>No to Nestl&eacute;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision to award the contract for Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities&rsquo; bottled water to Nestl&eacute;; considers this decision to be, at the very least, misguided given Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s previous involvement in a number of aggressive marketing campaigns to promote formula milk; notes that Nestl&eacute; utilises marketing practices which appear to be in direct violation of the WHO/UNICEF International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes; further notes Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s powerful influence over market trends, governments and other companies, culminating in the adoption of questionable marketing practices which could weaken legislation designed to protect infant health; views with interest report findings published by International Baby Food Action Network which shows Nestl&eacute; to be the largest single source of violation of the marketing code worldwide, and calls for an obligation to be placed on local authorities to thoroughly research companies to ensure that a positive ethical choice is made when spending taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1881</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>The National Game on Terrestrial Television</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the new findings of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission that there is an overwhelming 96% public support for Scotland&rsquo;s international football matches being shown on free-to-air terrestrial television from among those interested in football and even 70% support from those who would not watch it; recognises that only one-third of households have access to subscription TV services; supports the right of the entire Scottish public to see the national team playing the national sport, and reiterates calls for this to take place, either through successful and wholehearted bidding by terrestrial broadcasters or through the exercise of government powers to reserve Scotland matches exclusively for terrestrial television.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1777</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Progress on HPV Vaccination but Screening Still Matters</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that a vaccination programme against strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV), which cause 70% of cervical cancers, will begin in Scottish schools this year; recognises the need for a communications campaign to inform girls and their parents of the benefits of the vaccination; believes, however, that a comprehensive cervical screening programme remains very necessary and that vaccination should not be seen to undermine this need; further notes the recent worrying fall in attendance at cervical screening, especially among younger women, and calls on the Scottish Government to take further action to encourage women to attend for screening when invited and continue to build on the success of the cervical cancer screening programme in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1777.1</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Progress on HPV Vaccination but Screening Still Matters</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1777) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out &quot;believes, however&quot; and insert &quot;notes the reduction in deaths from cervical cancer but also the increase in cancer in situ cases and therefore believes&quot;</p>
