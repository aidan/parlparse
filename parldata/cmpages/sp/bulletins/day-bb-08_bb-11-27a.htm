<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by </em>Ministerial Statement: A Framework for Science in Scotland</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Government Debate: Sea Fisheries&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2966</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scottish Government in negotiating a deal that is fair and just for Scotland&rsquo;s fishing communities and that reflects in full the leadership that Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen are showing the rest of Europe on sustainable fisheries. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2966.3</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2966) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;the Scottish Government&quot; to end and insert &quot;Team UK and in particular the positive approach taken by the new UK Fisheries Minister and the work of the Scottish Government in seeking to negotiate a deal that is fair and just for Scotland&rsquo;s fishing communities, and which will secure sustainable fisheries for Scotland, and commends the Scottish Fishermen&rsquo;s Federation&rsquo;s recent environmental statement and for the leadership and innovation being shown by Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen, demonstrating the way forward for the rest of Europe.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2966.1</strong> <strong>John Scott: Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2966) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;; notes with concern the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals for west coast stocks that, if implemented, could especially damage the viability of the west coast langoustine sector, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to work towards a settlement that successfully balances the need to conserve depleted west coast whitefish stocks with a thriving langoustine fishery.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2966.2</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur: Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2966) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;welcomes the work that Scottish fishermen have been taking forward with government, scientists and others over recent years to develop a more sophisticated approach to protecting cod and safeguarding fishing opportunities; recognises that the process of improving stakeholder involvement in EU fisheries policy began with the establishment of the influential regional advisory councils, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue driving forward this regionalised approach as a means of improving fisheries management decisions within the Common Fisheries Policy in the interests of sustaining stocks, Scotland&rsquo;s fishing fleet and the communities that depend on it.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2965</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>St Andrew&rsquo;s Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes in the importance of St Andrew&rsquo;s Day, Scotland&rsquo;s national day; recognises the opportunity that it presents for everyone in Scotland, and friends of Scotland around the world, to celebrate our history, culture and traditions as well as the vibrant, creative and dynamic nation that Scotland is today; notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s support for a programme of events throughout Scotland as part of the Winter Festival, and supports the opportunity that St Andrew&rsquo;s Day provides to prepare the way for the 2009 Year of Homecoming, which will give a much-needed boost to the Scottish tourism sector and to the economy generally. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2965.1</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank: St Andrew&rsquo;s Day</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2965) in the name of Linda Fabiani, insert at end &quot;, and welcomes the example set by the ancient burgh of St Andrews in organising its own programme of events for St Andrew&rsquo;s Day, which provides an appropriate focus for the nation&rsquo;s celebrations at this time of year.&quot; </p>

  <p><em> </em>Debate on the draft Provision of School Lunches (Disapplication of the Requirement to Charge) (Scotland) Order 2008&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-2958</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Provision of School Lunches (Disapplication of the Requirement to Charge) (Scotland) Order 2008 be approved.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2958.2</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2958) in the name of Bruce Crawford, insert at end &quot;but in doing so, recognises that this measure in itself will not deliver one free school meal and that it is the responsibility of the Scottish Government to fully fund the SNP&rsquo;s manifesto commitments; therefore calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that funding is not diverted from vulnerable groups or teaching provision in order to implement the policy of free school meals for all pupils in primaries 1 to 3, and further calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward to the Parliament early in the New Year detailed up-to-date costings for implementing its free school meals proposal.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2958.1</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith: Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2958) in the name of Bruce Crawford, insert at end  &quot;but in doing so, calls on the Scottish Government not to impose any financial penalty, directly or indirectly, on any local authority that exercises its discretion not to provide school meals free of charge to all pupils in primaries 1 to 3.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-2817</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>World AIDS Day 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of World AIDS Day on 1 December 2008 and its aim of highlighting the challenges and consequences of the HIV epidemic around the world; acknowledges that there are 33 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide and that countries face a myriad challenges in halting the spread of the virus and improving the lives and experiences of people affected; recognises that HIV diagnoses in Scotland have been increasing in recent years with 2007 seeing the highest annual number on record; acknowledges that it is estimated that there are 5,500 people now living with HIV in Scotland; regrets that a recent poll found that people in Scotland had comparatively poorer rates of HIV knowledge than in other areas of the United Kingdom; considers that this lack of public understanding about the virus and how it is transmitted compounds and exacerbates the stigma and prejudice experienced by many people living with HIV in Scotland, and therefore supports this year&rsquo;s theme of Respect and Protect, which highlights the responsibility of everyone to transform attitudes to HIV and encourage actions that stop its spread. </p>
