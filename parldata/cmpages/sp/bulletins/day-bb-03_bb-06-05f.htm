          <p><strong>*S2M-110</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Valuing Carers</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the hard work and dedication of Scotland's 
            115,675 unpaid carers, a workforce comparable to the total NHS workforce 
            in Scotland; acknowledges the role of Scotland's carer population 
            as partners in the provision of care; recognises the measures outlined 
            in <em>Partnership for Care: Scotland&#146;s Health White Paper</em> 
            and in the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 to increase 
            partnership working across the health and social care services; notes 
            that the health and well-being of many carers are affected as a direct 
            consequence of the physical and emotional strains of caring; welcomes 
            the dedication of care assistants across Scotland in providing vital 
            respite services to carers and their families; congratulates the UK-wide 
            network of 30,000 Princess Royal Trust for Carers centres on the level 
            of support that they provide to carers and their families; recognises 
            that there are many more unidentified carers in Scotland and that, 
            for appropriate support to be administered, these carers must be identified; 
            further welcomes the publication of <em>Focus on Carers and the NHS 
            - identifying and supporting hidden carers - Good Practice Guide </em>by 
            the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and the strategies for identifying 
            carers contained therein, and calls on the Scottish Executive to target 
            resources specifically on identifying and supporting carers in order 
            that the vision underpinning recent legislation can be realised.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-109</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Raffan: Independent Public 
            Inquiry into Iraq Intelligence Dossier</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            calls upon the Prime Minister to establish an independent public inquiry 
            into the intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction, which 
            was used by Her Majesty&#146;s Government to justify the invasion 
            of Iraq.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-108</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: You Are Not Alone 
            Family Support Group</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            pleasure the opening of the You Are Not Alone (YANA) holistic centre 
            and family support group in Stranraer for families in Wigtownshire 
            whose lives have been affected by drug or alcohol abuse; commends 
            the dedication, enthusiasm and commitment of the volunteers whose 
            dedication and personal experience has led to the establishment of 
            the YANA centre, and welcomes the services and support offered by 
            the group as a genuine and meaningful step forward in both dealing 
            with and understanding problems associated with alcohol and drug addiction.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-104# Dumfries and Galloway Housing Partnership</strong> 
            (lodged on 3 June 2003) Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-103.1</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
            Young People</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-103) in 
            the name of Peter Peacock, insert at end &quot;whilst recognising 
            the central role played by parents and families in enabling young 
            people to become responsible adults and therefore fulfil their potential.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-103.2</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: Young People</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-103) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave 
            out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises, 
            however, that these aspirations are often unachievable with the continuing 
            and increasing levels of poverty and deprivation among Scotland&#146;s 
            young people; further recognises that the removal of the right to 
            claim income support from 16 and 17 year olds has resulted in 11,000 
            young Scots being unemployed and having no income whatsoever; notes 
            that poverty and deprivation amongst Scotland&#146;s young people 
            have resulted in a tidal wave of despair and alienation; further notes 
            that suicides amongst young men in Scotland have increased by more 
            than 70% in the past 30 years and are now responsible for the deaths 
            of more young men in Scotland than road traffic accidents; believes 
            that the stigmatisation of young people through the use of pejorative 
            language and a generalised association with criminal activity does 
            our young people a grave disservice; further notes that juvenile offending 
            rates have remained unchanged over the past 10 years, and pays tribute 
            to the work of organisations such as NCH Scotland and SACRO which 
            have pioneered work with young offenders to remove them from the adult 
            criminal justice system.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-103.3</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Young People</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-103) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave 
            out from first &quot;will&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises, 
            however, that it is essential for Scotland that we have the powers 
            to ensure that young people do not have to leave Scotland in their 
            20s to find a future; further recognises that tackling the low birth 
            rate and developing an effective inward migration policy for Scotland 
            are vital elements towards ensuring that there are enough young Scots 
            to maintain our country&#146;s vitality, and, in the meantime, notes 
            that it is right for there to be a Children&#146;s Commissioner and 
            for the Scottish Executive to develop measures in the field of education 
            and youth work, and to provide additional support for learning, volunteering, 
            culture, sport and leisure facilities for young people in Scotland.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-103.4</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott: Young People</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-103) in the name of Peter Peacock, insert 
            at end &quot;and calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that 
            educational programmes dealing with sustainable development and environmental 
            and social justice issues are included in the curriculum in order 
            to foster responsible attitudes, that opportunities for outdoor education 
            are emphasised, that particular attention is paid to those one in 
            seven young people who are reported to have &quot;disappeared&quot; 
            from the system and are not in a job, training, education or on the 
            unemployment register despite government measures such as the New 
            Deal, and that the minimum age for voting and standing in elections 
            is lowered to 16 years.&quot; </p>
