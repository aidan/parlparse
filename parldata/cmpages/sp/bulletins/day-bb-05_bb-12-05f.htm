<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#117;</FONT>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3667</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>International Day of Climate Protest - Edinburgh, 3 December 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the International Day of Climate Protest on Saturday 3 December 2005 and the demonstrations being held in Edinburgh and London; notes that 32 countries are taking part so far, including all G8 nations; notes that the Edinburgh demonstration will gather at 11 am in East Market Street, near Waverley station, set off at 11.30 am and rally outside the Parliament at 12.15 pm; notes that speakers include Duncan McLaren from Friends of the Earth Scotland, Mark Lazarowicz MP, Mike Pringle MSP and Mark Ballard MSP; notes that organisers are planning to include a choir, drumming and the Canap&eacute;s and Cocktails Collective providing mince pies and warm drinks; notes that further information is available at <a href="http://www.globalclimatecampaign.org/index-en.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.globalclimatecampaign.org/index-en.shtml</a>, and encourages everyone in Scotland concerned about climate change to take part in the Edinburgh demonstration this Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3666</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Scottish Empowerment Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent Scottish Empowerment Awards which were held in Glasgow recently and organised by EMPOWER Scotland; congratulates all those involved with the organisation of the event and the valuable work of EMPOWER Scotland, and believes that it is important to highlight the enormous contribution being made to Scotland by the black and ethnic minority communities.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3664</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Peace and Justice for the People of Chechnya</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the mass killings of innocent people and other atrocities which have taken place in Chechnya and believes that the UK Government should use its Presidency of the European Union to facilitate negotiations between Chechnya and the Russian Federation to try to bring about a peaceful and just solution to the dispute.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3663</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Gaelic Digital Television</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the reported increase in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s contribution to the establishment of a Gaelic language digital television channel; regrets that Westminster appears to be refusing to follow suit; believes that digital technology provides the opportunity for an exciting new era for Gaelic broadcasting, but notes with dismay that, while the new channel is expected to be broadcasting by the autumn of 2006, switchover to digital is not scheduled to take place until 2009 for the Grampian and Scottish television areas, leaving many people, particularly in those areas with the highest concentration of Gaelic speakers, without affordable access to Gaelic digital broadcasting for three years.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3661</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle:</strong> <strong>World Heritage Site Status for the Forth Rail Bridge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the continued inclusion of the Forth Rail Bridge on the UK Tentative List for World Heritage Site Status; considers that the bridge has outstanding universal value and cultural qualities and should therefore be awarded this status; believes that Historic Scotland, the Scottish Executive and Fife Council should back the motion passed by the City of Edinburgh Council to support the inclusion of the bridge on the list; considers that the UK Government should make the appropriate representations to UNESCO, and believes that the award of this status for the Forth Rail Bridge would be a welcome addition to Scotland&rsquo;s four other World Heritage Sites.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3660</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Forth Road Bridge Tolls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that there should be a thorough and wide-ranging consultation process on the issue of the future of tolls on the Forth Road Bridge; considers that this consultation process should not commence until the Tolled Bridges Review is completed in order for the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s position on the Forth Road Bridge tolls to be set in the national context, and is disappointed at media reports that the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications appears to have pre-empted any real or meaningful consultation process by backing toll levels up to &pound;4.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3656(<FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#117;</FONT>) </strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Scottish Children and Fuel Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that there are approximately 10,000 fuel poor households with children with a poor energy efficiency rating and 5,000 households with children in fuel poverty with no central heating, including households in the Scottish Borders; notes that this equates to approximately 46,000 children living in fuel poverty; further notes that for every 5% increase in fuel prices a further 30,000 more households go into fuel poverty and that gas and electricity prices continue to rise against the background of a predicted severe winter, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency and as a first step, extend the central heating programme to those 5,000 households at a cost in the order of &pound;1.6 million against a budget of &pound;97 million for the existing central heating programme and thereafter consider extending the programme to ensure that no Scottish child suffers from the consequences of fuel poverty.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3651</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Greenpeace at CBI Conference</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Greenpeace on their direct action at the CBI conference; applauds its actions in exposing the hypocrisy of the UK Government&rsquo;s stance on nuclear energy and in highlighting the pro-nuclear sympathies of the Government which fly in the face of the scientific facts regarding the dangers of nuclear waste, the lack of government investment in renewable energy and the lack of long-term investment in proper measures to tackle climate change, and condemns the actions of the Government which undemocratically ignores the wishes of the Scottish people regarding nuclear power.</p>

It is accepted that not all voluntary organisations will have an interest in seeking partnership with the Executive.&nbsp;Some will pursue their own objectives without reference to the state.

<p><strong>S2M-3642#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Beauly to Denny Power Line: Concerns Over Increase of Childhood Leukaemia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of the Draper Report into the link between high voltage power lines and levels of childhood leukaemia which, among other findings, concluded that children who live within 200 metres of high voltage power lines were nearly twice as likely to have childhood leukaemia as those who lived within 600 metres of a line; further notes that the National Radiological Protection Board recommended that the UK Government should consider the need for further precautionary measures and, as a consequence, the Stakeholder Advisory Group on ELF EMFs was formed to explore the implications of a precautionary approach and make practical recommendations; is concerned that, with regard to the application by Scottish and Southern Energy to construct a high voltage power line between Beauly and Denny, a survey carried out by Stirling Before Pylons of the Stirling Council area shows that 50 houses are within 100 metres of the pylon corridor, that 48 flats housing approximately 330 students at Stirling University are within 200 metres and that 878 houses are within 600 metres of the pylon corridor, and believes, therefore, in view of the reports showing a link between high voltage power lines and childhood leukaemia and the results of the Stirling Before Pylons survey, that the Scottish Executive should seriously examine these matters as part of its consideration of the application or indeed any future public enquiries which might be held.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3641</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Arran Schools on Improvements to School Meals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Arran schools on plans to improve their school dinners by sourcing up to 70% of the ingredients used in the preparation of school meals from local suppliers, making schoolchildren healthier and reducing the use of processed foods; agrees that this is a great initiative which will also benefit local producers but that it will still only reach the 46% of school pupils who take school meals, and believes that free healthy school meals for all schoolchildren would ensure that all children would get a daily healthy meal.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3639</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> <strong>Opposition to Nuclear Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the UK Government&rsquo;s historical reluctance over the last 20 years to invest in renewable energy; further regrets that the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has already admitted that it will not achieve its 10% renewable energy target by 2010 and notes the progress that the Scottish Executive has made towards meeting its renewables target; regrets even more that the Prime Minister is supporting nuclear power, while the DTI has admitted that questions of finance, government support, market mechanisms, public support and storage of radioactive waste are all still unanswered; believes that efforts to present nuclear power as the solution to climate change are significantly undermined by the fact that electricity generation contributes less than a third of greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland; supports the Executive in its efforts to promote renewable energy, and calls on the UK Government to work on realistic approaches to cutting carbon emissions, rather than pretending that a discredited nuclear power industry can make a significant contribution.</p>
