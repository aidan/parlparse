the report of the Interdepartmental Review Group on Forestry; welcomes the proposed

end and insert &quot;but believes that the Scottish Executive has failed to acknowledge 
the significant contribution to the Scottish economy of the timber and forest 
products industry and, in particular, in respect of the existing devolved functions 
of the Executive, further believes that it has failed to recognise the importance 
of the urgent need to improve the road network used for forestry extraction, of 
an effective policy of procurement to encourage the Scottish national industry 
interest, of effective promotion of biomass to assist in the achievement of more 
economic means of supplying energy from renewable sources and of the encouragement 
and active promotion of the use of wood as a building material.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3541.1</STRONG>

the practical problems which face the Scottish forestry industry, particularly 
with regard to transport; further notes that the Executive has failed to set and 
promote robust planting targets or to plan for the impending doubling of timber 
output over the next 10 to 15 years, and urges the Executive to give greater priority 
to the issues which so concern what is now the third biggest industry in Scotland.&quot;</P></DIR></DIR><P><em>followed
