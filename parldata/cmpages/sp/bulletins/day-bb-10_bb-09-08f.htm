<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6933 Mary Scanlon: ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Virus Link Found in Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the conclusions of a study by scientists at the University of Dundee that has found further evidence that myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), could be caused by a virus; considers that these findings will be welcomed by young people with ME/CFS in the Highlands and across Scotland who still experience the consequences of the belief that ME is a disease of the mind rather than, as this evidence suggests, a disease of the body; notes that 25 children with ME/CFS were assessed along with 23 controls and that all 25 children with ME/CFS were found to have abnormalities in their blood, providing similar results to those previously identified in adults with ME/CFS, and further thanks and congratulates the Young ME Sufferers (Tymes) Trust, which is the longest established national UK service for children and young people with ME and their families, with a team of professionals who give all their time free of charge, and ME Research UK, which is a charity with the principal aim of commissioning and funding scientific investigation into the causes, consequences and treatment of ME/CFS, for their support of this study and all the outstanding work that they do for the many thousands of people with ME/CFS across Scotland and the UK.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Mitchell<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong>, Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Jackson Carlaw<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-6932# Anne McLaughlin: Silence in George Square</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns what it considers to be the culture of silence in Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s Labour administration enveloping the large number of scandals in recent months; considers that the City Chambers has been linked with drug taking, breach of the peace, awarding contracts to firms with gangland links, systematic patronage in the appointment of arms length external organisations and the complete mismanagement of the handling of an important LGBT centre, and would welcome an investigation into the goings-on in the Labour Party in Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6931&diams;   Rob Gibson: Investing in the Future of Scotland&rsquo;s Peatlands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) UK Peatland Programme and Commission of Inquiry on Peatlands with funding from the Peter De Haan Charitable Trust and believes that IUCN UK&rsquo;s decision to base this prestigious programme in Scotland is recognition of the global significance of Scotland&rsquo;s peatlands and underlines that Scotland leads the world in peatland restoration expertise; considers that, while scientific understanding of peatlands is developing rapidly, the knowledge base is strong enough to recognise that peatlands deliver multiple benefits for biodiversity, water and climate and that the example of the Flow Country of Caithness and Sutherland shows how peatlands can deliver significant economic benefits to local communities through encouraging visitors to these beautiful and fragile landscapes; believes that the land use strategy required by the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 provides an opportunity for peatland restoration to be championed at the heart of government, and further believes that action taken now could prevent massive future costs arising from the breakdown of peatland ecosystems and that target-based peatland restoration offers an important opportunity to help meet Scotland&rsquo;s climate change targets.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6930 Mary Mulligan: Congratulations to PSYBT West Lothian Business Awards Winners 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Michael Smith on winning the Prince&rsquo;s Scottish Youth Business Trust Business Awards West Lothian Final 2010 for his personal training and sports massage therapy business, Personal Best: Health Fitness and Wellbeing, based in Bathgate; notes that, in addition to developing his business, Michael has also helped prepare the Scottish Women&rsquo;s Rugby squad for its Six Nations tournament, was the official massage therapist for Basketball Scotland and accompanied the Scottish Junior Ladies Team to the European Championships in Romania, and also commends Rebecca Kelly who was runner up with her hair and beauty salon, RK Hair Studio in Bathgate, and the three other finalists, Lindsay McGeechan of Beauty Boutique in Bathgate, Damian and Joseph Duffin of Experience Exercise in Bathgate and Jonathan Sneddon of Valet Master (Scotland) based in Mid Calder, all of whom were awarded Business Excellence Awards.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6929&diams;   Ian McKee: Dr Elsie Inglis and Her Scottish Angels</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its wholehearted support to the campaign and trustto erect a permanent monument in Edinburgh&rsquo;s Royal Mile to Dr Elsie Inglis and her &quot;Scottish angels&quot; and establish an annual bursary as lasting memorials to these 1,000 Scottish women; considers these women to be the most iconic volunteers of World War 1 who carried the lamp borne by nurses Nightingale and Seacole in the Crimean War into the nightmare world of trench warfare from France to Russia, acting as chief medical officers, surgeons, anaesthetists, radiographers, nurses, ambulance drivers, cooks, auxiliaries and administrators and, in performing such vital functions to the highest degree of competency, advanced enormously the role of women in all aspects of work and society; offers its welcome for the multimedia travelling exhibition, appearing at the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh, Les Invalides in Paris and in London and Belgrade, the first major art exhibition about women in war that has at its centre 40 new paintings by the Scottish artist, John Bellany, and which highlights this contribution, recognising the courage, determination and achievement of these &quot;femmes &eacute;cossaises&quot; and their founder, Dr Elsie Inglis, and considers that British Government recognition of the wartime role of these Scottish women is long overdue.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6928 Stewart Maxwell: East Renfrewshire Food Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the second East Renfrewshire Food Festival, which is scheduled to run from 11 to 18 September 2010 alongside Scottish Food Fortnight; notes that the festival, organised by East Renfrewshire Council in conjunction with EventScotland, will focus on healthy eating and offer a programme of events to celebrate local Scottish produce as well as ethnic cuisine; further notes that the seven-day showcase will include a local farmers&rsquo; market in Clarkston, an evening of whisky tasting at Eastwood Park Theatre and a visit from the Focus on Food Cooking Bus, which will offer children and parents advice and interactive cooking lessons, and encourages people from the west of Scotland and beyond not to miss out on what promises to be a fantastic celebration of Scottish food and drink.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6926 Christine Grahame: Trackplot on Course for Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success of the Kelso firm, Trackplot, a locally based start-up company that has recently developed an award-winning, and what is considered to be world-beating, product called Trackplot.com that could help save the lives of hillwalkers, mountaineers and sailors by enabling their loved ones and employers to pinpoint their exact location when on the hills or at sea; further notes that, unlike other products offering a similar service, it does not rely on a mobile phone signal, and believes that Borders&rsquo; firms such as Trackplot are demonstrating that, despite tough economic conditions, with the right skills and knowledge local firms can still be successful and look forward to expanding in niche markets.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6925 Bill Wilson: Paisley Abbey Drain Excavation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Renfrewshire Local History Forum on its second excavation of the Paisley Abbey Drain to coincide with Renfrewshire&rsquo;s Doors Open Day and Scottish Archaeology Month; considers that Paisley Abbey has been a focal point of the town since 1163 and so recognises the cultural significance of the continued work, the first phase of which took place in 2009, and wishes the forum well with its ongoing discovery and exploration of historical sites throughout Renfrewshire.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6924 Elaine Smith: Auchengeich Colliery Disaster</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the anniversary of the Auchengeich Colliery disaster, which claimed the lives of 47 miners on 18 September 1959 in one of Scotland&rsquo;s worst mining disasters of the 20th century; recognises that this disaster has had a lasting impact on the people of Chryston and the surrounding areas; welcomes the expansion of the memorial site, including what it considers to be a fantastic bronze statue sculpted by John McKenna, which will serve as a reminder to future generations of the sacrifice of those who braved difficult and dangerous conditions in Scotland&rsquo;s mines; commends the trade union movement for its work in campaigning for stricter enforcement and higher penalties for breaches of health and safety laws; believes that health and safety in the workplace should not be compromised as a result of any potential cuts; expresses solidarity with miners throughout the world, particularly the 33 Chilean miners who are trapped 700 metres below the Atacama Desert, and wishes the men a safe return to their friends and family.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6923&diams;   Ross Finnie: Hunterston Not the Way Forward for Carbon Capture</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the lodging of the application by Peel Energy Ltd to build a 1,600 megawatt coal-fired power station at Hunterston, North Ayrshire; understands that, initially, the power station is to have 400 megawatt of its gross output (300 megawatt net) processed through carbon capture and storage technology, which would leave 75% to 80% of the plant&rsquo;s CO2 emissions unabated for an indeterminate length of time; considers that these unabated emissions, which could amount to up to some four million tonnes of CO2 emissions per annum, are incompatible with the climate change targets set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, and accordingly believes that the development of carbon capture and storage technology should be restricted to existing coal-fired stations.</p>
