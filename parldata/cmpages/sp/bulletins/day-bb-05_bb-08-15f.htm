That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

          <p align="center"><strong> New and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-3154 Bruce Crawford: National Licensing Forum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the establishment of the National Licensing Forum by the Scottish Executive on 22 June 2005; recalls that, in evidence to the Parliament&rsquo;s Local Government and Transport Committee on 17 May 2005, the then minister responsible for licensing, Tavish Scott MSP, said that the Executive saw &ldquo;the Forum being comprised of people who have a direct interest and understanding of the trade and related issues in alcohol and licensing reform&rdquo; and that &ldquo;if we do not get the balance right or if there is concern&mdash;from Parliament or any other quarter&mdash;that we have got the balance wrong or that we have missed someone out, we will reconsider the membership. We intend to come to a final view on that in the summer&rdquo;; recognises that, of the twelve members of the National Licensing Forum, only one has current experience as an operator within the commercial on-trade despite the fact that these premises, including pubs, restaurants and hotels, account for nearly 11,000 of Scotland&rsquo;s 17,000 commercially licensed premises; notes that it will be difficult for the members of the National Licensing Forum to comment meaningfully on issues affecting these sectors of the licensed industry without having this experience of operating on licensed premises, and calls for the Scottish Executive to review the membership of the National Licensing Forum as a matter of urgency to ensure that more individuals with experience of the pub, hotel and restaurant sectors are added to the forum&rsquo;s membership.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-3153 Shiona Baird: Moray Rural Schools Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by Moray Council that it is to withdraw its controversial proposals to close or merge more than 20 primary schools in the face of unprecedented public opposition; congratulates parents and community groups across the region on the resounding success of their campaign to save their local schools; commends council members for recognising the strength of public opinion on the issue and making an early announcement of their decision in order to avoid prolonging community uncertainty; believes that rural schools throughout Scotland must be adequately maintained and resourced if they are to remain as vital hubs of the community and not be subject to regular threats of closure or merger by cash-strapped councils; urges campaigners to continue to press for special status for rural schools, and calls on the Scottish Executive to adopt a presumption against their closure in view of their added value to the communities they serve.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-3152 Chris Ballance: Belarus Playwrights&rsquo; Guild</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the government of Belarus for banning the newly formed Belarus Playwrights&rsquo; Guild and offers support to all those promoting freedom of expression and association in Belarus.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-3151 John Scott: Ayr Flower Show 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Ayrshire Horticultural Society and its Chairman, Mr John Walker, on the success of the Ayr Flower Show, now in its 45th year, which ran from 5 to 7 August 2005; recognises the hard work and dedication of the 300 volunteers who helped ensure that the event went ahead this year; notes that almost 28,000 visitors attended the show, and hopes that the event will long continue to enjoy its status as one of Scotland&rsquo;s premier flower shows.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-3150 Mr Brian Monteith: Justice and Mercy?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision to reject the opportunity to display Alexander Mylne&rsquo;s 1637 statues of Justice and Mercy; supports the opinion of Duncan Macmillan, Professor Emeritus in the History of Scottish Art at the University of Edinburgh, that &ldquo;a parliament that has no place for Justice and Mercy is either too feeble to exercise such fundamental virtues of government, or else too unprincipled to care about them&rdquo;, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to accelerate the establishment of its advisory body for the display of art and artefacts in the Parliament and to take a decision to ensure that Justice and Mercy are part of the new Scottish Parliament.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-3149 Shiona Baird: Federation of Small Businesses&rsquo; Research on Supermarket Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes a new research initiative by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) to gauge the impact on the small business sector following, or pending, the opening of new supermarkets and out-of-town retail parks; acknowledges the serious concerns expressed by many small and medium-sized businesses whose viability is threatened by the increasingly dominant supermarket sector; notes that in the United States of America a number of towns are either banning new supermarket developments or severely restricting the size of proposed stores to limit the damage to existing independent small and medium-sized businesses; believes that local authority planners must be persuaded that an overprovision of large supermarkets has a predictably catastrophic effect on the small and medium-sized business sector and the wider local economy; encourages all small and medium-sized businesses in Scotland, whether or not they are members, to participate in the FSB&rsquo;s research project and respond to it with details of their individual experiences, and urges the Scottish Executive, in the interests of economic diversity and natural justice, to address urgently anomalies, such as those in the rating system, whereby supermarkets enjoy more favourable treatment at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-3147# Ms Sandra White: Voting Difficulties for Disabled People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the Polls Apart 4 Scotland research carried out on behalf of Capability Scotland which show that the number of disabled people who experienced difficulty or impossibility in voting in person has risen from 17% during the 2003 Holyrood elections to 24% at the 2005 Westminster elections due to lack of accessibility at polling stations; is dismayed that one in five voters with a learning disability found voting difficult because of lack of access to information of how to vote or a failure to help on the part of polling station staff due to their lack of training in dealing with people with learning disabilities, and is worried about the failure to address the problems of lack of awareness of many disabled people of the availability of the postal vote and the difficulties which many who did have a postal vote had with the process.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-3146 Bristow Muldoon: Right Hon Robin Cook MP</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its condolences to the family and friends of the Right Hon Robin Cook MP following his untimely and sad death on 6 August 2005; recognises the major contribution made by Robin within the United Kingdom and internationally over decades as one of the most able parliamentarians of his generation, and acknowledges the dedicated service that he offered to his constituents in West Lothian.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-3145 Murdo Fraser: The Future of Scottish Bank Notes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern <em>Banknote issue arrangements in Scotland and Northern Ireland: a consultation document</em>, published by HM Treasury in July 2005, which proposes additional restrictions on the rights of the Scottish clearing banks to issue banknotes; further notes that the Treasury is considering placing a requirement on Scottish banks &ldquo;to issue only one note design for each denomination at any one time&rdquo; and that such a stipulation would threaten the issuing of limited edition Scottish notes such as the &pound;5 note featuring Jack Nicklaus recently issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland; believes that such restrictions would be an entirely retrograde step and represent a wholly unnecessary intrusion into the rights of Scottish banks to issue their own notes; recalls that it was through the actions and campaigning of the great Tory patriot, Sir Walter Scott, that the rights of the Scottish banks to issue notes were preserved in the 19th century, and calls on all Scottish patriots today to unite to oppose these Treasury plans which represent a threat to the successful Scottish banking sector.</p>
