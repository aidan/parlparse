<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3547</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Full Reprieve for St Margaret&rsquo;s Hospice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to defer the transfer of 30 continuing care beds from St Margaret&rsquo;s hospice to Blawarthill Hospital until 2012, believes that this confirms the provision of care at St Margaret&rsquo;s Hospice to be satisfactory, and calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to grant St Margaret&rsquo;s hospice a permanent reprieve and instead locate the alternative care provision being suggested for St Margaret&rsquo;s within Blawarthill Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3546</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Wood News is Good News</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of &pound;870,000 in Scottish Government funding that is to benefit over 20 urban woodland projects across Scotland, including a community event that is to take place at Heathcote Avenue, Drumchapel, during National Tree Week and the Drumchapel Woodland Group, which has received &pound;3,700 in order to take on a part-time volunteer coordinator; notes the importance of such projects in boosting the sense of pride and community in local areas, and commends the ongoing hard work and commitment of all those involved in such projects.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3545</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Bus Services in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the announcement from First Bus that four bus routes in Edinburgh are to be withdrawn completely and a further six reduced, including the number 140 service to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary; notes that the ongoing tram chaos has been cited as one of the primary causes for the reduction in bus routes; regrets the impact of the tram-related roadworks on levels of public transport use in the city; expresses deep concern over reports of spiralling costs and expected delays in completion of the tram project and its potential impact on the future services provided by both Lothian Buses and First Bus, and believes that the award-winning service provided by the publicly owned Lothian Buses must not be put in jeopardy by the escalating costs of the tramline.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3544</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>The draft Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007 (Inhibition) Order 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that the draft Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007 (Inhibition) Order 2009 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3543</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Health Boards (Membership and Elections) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Health Boards (Membership and Elections) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Shona Robison<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3542</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3541#</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Support Glasgow&rsquo;s Local Town Centres</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that a vibrant, dynamic town centre plays an important part in the lives of communities across Scotland; welcomes the funds being made available for the regeneration of town centres; believes that many of Glasgow&rsquo;s distinctive local communities such as Maryhill and Possilpark also have town centres that require regeneration; further believes that areas such as Milton would also benefit from the creation of a town centre, and would welcome the provision of funds to support the social and economic development of these town centres across the city.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3540&diams;</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>The Future of Scottish Newspapers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent announcement by Trinity Mirror that a quarter of journalists at the <em>Daily Record</em> and the <em>Sunday Mail </em>will lose their jobs due to the newspapers merging; further notes that this follows on from proposed cutbacks in editorial staff at the Herald and Times Group and concerns about the future of other Scottish daily and weekly newspapers including Johnston Press, which owns the Fife Free Press Group; recognises that, while the crisis in the Scottish print media mirrors the situation worldwide with the economic downturn dramatically affecting circulation and advertising, the Scottish press faces particular difficulties including the loss of government advertising to the internet, and believes that the democratic process requires a vibrant Scottish newspaper sector with all sides working to minimise job losses and find long-term solutions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3539</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>UNICEF Highlights the Children&rsquo;s Arc of Prosperity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of a report by UNICEF, <em>Child Poverty in Perspective: An Overview of Child Well-being in Rich Countries</em>, which provides an overview of the state of childhood in the majority of economically advanced nations of the world; notes with concern that, according to the report, the United Kingdom lags behind other highly developed countries in terms of relative poverty and deprivation, quality of children&rsquo;s relationships with their parents and peers, child health and safety, behaviour and risk-taking and subjective wellbeing; further notes that, of the top 10 countries meeting the best child-wellbeing indicators, the majority are small, independent nations that are identified in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s National Conversation as part of the arc of prosperity, and believes that only independence will equip Scotland with the power that it needs vastly to improve child wellbeing and end child poverty in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3538</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Cultural and Social Enterprise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that social enterprises have an important role in the promotion of social cohesion and sustainable development within our communities, generating substantial social, cultural, environmental and economic benefits; notes the emergence of cultural social enterprises throughout Scotland, building on the long history of cultural organisations using entrepreneurial talent to deliver social benefits and creating a bridge between the artistic and business communities; considers that the social enterprise model delivers high quality businesses that use their more-than-profit ethos to meet social needs and are capable of delivering sustainable growth despite economic recession, in circumstances where traditional commercial organisations would struggle to survive; notes, however, that support for social enterprise is currently provided through many diverse routes and believes that it would greatly benefit the sector if there were greater clarity and a more coordinated approach between funding bodies; congratulates the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition for its membership-led championing of the cause of the diverse range of cultural and other social enterprises, and wishes the coalition and the sector every success for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3537</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Maryhill, Kelvin and Canal Community Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those nominated and shortlisted for the <em>Evening Times</em> Community Champions Awards; acknowledges the contribution made to their local communities by all the individuals and organisations involved, and applauds the particular efforts of the following winners - Good Morning Glasgow, Hugh and Margaret Tavendale, Mary Anne McIllroy, the staff of Community Central Halls, Remzije Sherifi and the Ruchill Youth Project, Groovy Greens.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3536</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Support for St Margaret of Scotland Hospice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to issue notice to the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice that funding for longer stay continuing care beds will be withdrawn from early 2012; considers that the current arrangements for funding palliative care provision have placed St Margaret&rsquo;s at a very considerable disadvantage, with St Margaret&rsquo;s receiving &pound;31,000 per bed per year compared with a Scottish average of &pound;86,000 per bed per year, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to take all steps necessary in conjunction with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to ensure that St Margaret&rsquo;s can continue to deliver top quality continuing and palliative care.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3533</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government Should Set Fairtrade Example</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Fairtrade Fortnight; notes that the Scottish Government spends almost &pound;100 million on food for schools, hospitals and workplaces every year and calls on it to set a positive example by ensuring that at least 10% of this expenditure is spent on fairtrade products, thereby making Edinburgh the fairtrade capital of Europe, and recognises that this target would set a great example to supermarkets, businesses and consumers and that the fairtrade movement has made a real difference to the lives of some of the world&rsquo;s poorest people by ensuring that farmers and workers get a fair price from the trade of their products and making a vital contribution to combating poverty.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3531</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>North Lanarkshire Social Work Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates North Lanarkshire Council and the staff within social work services on the excellent report received from the Social Work Inspection Agency; recognises that this is the second best inspection report in Scotland, which is particularly impressive given the relatively high levels of deprivation within North Lanarkshire, and acknowledges that, following on from the positive HM Inspectorate of Education report last year on child protection services, this is a clear indication of the commitment of social work staff within North Lanarkshire to provide the highest levels of care for all clients.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3473</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>A Questionable Future for Nuclear Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the disbanding of the Nuclear Safety Advisory Committee (NuSAC), an expert advisory committee that has been offering critical advice to Britain&rsquo;s Health and Safety Executive for nearly 50 years; notes that NuSAC consisted of 19 safety experts, including scientists, academics, trade unionists and business executives, none of whom were paid; further notes that the committee&rsquo;s disbanding closely followed a report that it issued in July 2008 listing a number of concerns and warnings regarding nuclear decommissioning programmes, skilled staff shortages and siting criteria for new stations; expresses alarm that NuSAC was quietly scrapped in October 2008 without an immediate replacement planned at such a vital time when nuclear new build and waste issues are so high on the public agenda, and finally calls for a successor body to be set up immediately to provide independent, expert safety advice and ensure that such critical information is easily accessible and available in the public domain.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3473.1</strong> <strong>James Kelly:</strong> <strong>A Questionable Future for Nuclear Safety</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3473) in the name of Rob Gibson, leave out from &quot;condemns&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that the board of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) decided not to reappoint its former Nuclear Safety Advisory Committee after it had completed its term of office last year because of the need to respond to the Stone Report on nuclear regulation; further notes the recommendations of the Stone Report, published in January 2009, and its implications for the HSE, and looks forward to the HSE taking the necessary steps to ensure that the very strong safety record of nuclear power stations in Scotland is further strengthened by the development of new mechanisms appropriate to the changing circumstances of the nuclear energy industry in the twenty-first century.&quot;</p>
