            ask the Scottish Executive why the post of the chair of the Cultural 
            Commission was not advertised; whether the rules on public appointments 
            were followed when making this appointment and what the reasons were 
            for its position on the matter; what the remit, salary and term of 
            office of the post will be; what the operating cost of the commission 
            and any secretariat is estimated to be; how many staff are, or will

            budget their salaries will be paid; who is authorised to appoint commission 
            staff; how commission members will be appointed and whether the procedures 
            in respect of public appointments will be followed; whether the chair 
            and commission members will be required to declare political affiliations, 
            and what the nature of the relationship will be between the commission

            the Scottish Executive what funding is available from its Freedom 
            of Information Unit for local archives and what funding the Executive

            Act 2002 and associated codes of practice.</P>

          <p><strong>S2W-8242</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether there are national guidelines for charges

          <p><strong>S2W-8244</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how many couples, in the last year for which 
            statistics are available, chose to have the civil status of marriage

            many in a ceremony conducted by a minister of religion authorised

          <p><strong>S2W-8245</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it has, since the publication of the 
            Civil Partnerships Bill in the House of Lords, consulted faith communities 
            to ask if they would wish the freedom to choose whether they will 
            be able to officiate in the creation of the civil status that will 
            arise from the Civil Partnerships Bill once enacted in the same way 
            as they may officiate in the creation of the civil status of marriage 
            under the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 and what the results of any 
            such consultation were.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8246</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what legal advice it has taken on whether, 
            if the Civil Partnerships Bill is enacted in the form currently proposed, 
            it would be acting contrary to Articles 9(1) and 14 of the European 
            Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by allowing mixed-sex 
            couples to manifest their faith in the creation of the civil status 
            of marriage while not giving same-sex couples the freedom to manifest 
            their faith in the creation of the civil status arising out of the 
            Civil Partnerships Bill.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8247</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether, if the Civil Partnership Bill is enacted 
            in its current form, people of faith who wish to manifest their faith 
            in the creation of their civil partnership will be able to request 
            that their minister of religion be appointed as a registrar for the 
            sole purpose of conducting that ceremony.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8248</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what the average total fees charged by a registrar 
            will be (a) for attending a place outside a registry office, including 
            the costs of approving that place, to conduct a marriage ceremony 
            and otherwise processing the marriage application and (b) for authorising 
            a minister of religion to be an authorised celebrant of marriages 
            in Scotland and processing an application for a couple to be married 
            by that minister of religion.</P>

            by legal ownership, for the purpose of controlling the movement of 
            wildlife, in order to avoid contravening the access provisions of 
            the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 and what legal restrictions exist
