<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3808</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 be extended to 24 April 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3807</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>A Lasting Legacy for Lanarkshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, from 3 to 7 August 2011, 1,500 young athletes aged 12 to 15 and 500 officials and coaches from over 70 countries will head to Lanarkshire for the 45th International Children&rsquo;s Games; welcomes the fantastic opportunity that this presents for the area to showcase to the world its wide range of world-class sporting facilities and the rich historical, cultural and natural heritage it has to offer; believes that the Games will deliver massive benefits for Lanarkshire and leave a lasting legacy that communities throughout the region will be able to enjoy for years to come, and commends the work undertaken by North and South Lanarkshire councils to encourage schools throughout Lanarkshire to use the Games as an opportunity for project-based learning and their efforts to ensure that it will be the most eco-friendly International Children&rsquo;s Games to date.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3806</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Greater Transparency in Global Financial Transactions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the opportunity that the Group of Twenty (G20) summit presents to reform the global financial system; notes the current lack of transparency, which, Christian Aid estimates, deprives developing countries of $160 billion per year&nbsp;due to two forms of corporate tax evasion; believes that Christian Aid is correct in calling for an accounting standard requiring country-by-country reporting, which would equip developed and developing countries with the information that they need&nbsp;to identify quickly where tax is being evaded; believes that&nbsp;the G20 should implement a global agreement that requires&nbsp;all jurisdictions&nbsp;to share tax information automatically, with strong sanctions for non-cooperative jurisdictions, and considers that this would equip developed and developing countries with information on companies and individuals shifting profits offshore.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3805</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Sweet 16? One Year On - Is Life Any Sweeter?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland (SCCYP) of <em>Sweet 16? One Year On - Is life any sweeter?</em>, a follow-up report to the SCCYP&rsquo;s 2008 report, <em>Sweet 16? The Age of Leaving Care in Scotland</em>; recognises the Scottish Government&rsquo;s interest and willingness to consider the issues raised in the Sweet 16 report but expresses concern that significant further action is still required by central and local government to implement fully the original report&rsquo;s 23 recommendations; fully supports the establishment of a system of care that ensures that young people can successfully make the difficult transition from care to independent living; supports the report&rsquo;s recommendations that the Scottish Government should set a timetable for prohibiting the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for care leavers, consider adding registered social landlords to the list of those required to cooperate with local authorities in discharging their responsibilities towards children and young people, introduce a system of classification for hostels for the homeless that indicates their suitability for care leavers, consider seeking a power to order local authorities to fulfil their statutory duties and continue to monitor implementation and provide appropriate challenge to local authorities; shares the SCCYP&rsquo;s belief that, in times of financial distress, we need to make sure that children and young people are the first to receive support and that this issue must remain high on the political agenda, and therefore urges the Scottish Government and local authorities to continue to ensure that the original Sweet 16 recommendations are fully implemented as quickly as possible to ensure that all young people in care in Scotland receive the best possible information, guidance, advice and support.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3804</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Boroughmuir High School on Winning the Scottish Final of Young Consumer of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Boroughmuir High School from Edinburgh on winning the Scottish final of the Young Consumer of the Year competition 2009; notes the school&rsquo;s proud record in the competition, having won the UK final in 2006 and finished as runner-up in 2008; further notes the excellent contributions of the other Scottish finalists, Dingwall Academy from Highland, Linlithgow Academy from West Lothian and Kyle Academy from South Ayrshire, and wishes the Boroughmuir team all the best as it represents Scotland at this year&rsquo;s UK final.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3803</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Ofgem Proposals and Prepayment Meters</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes proposals by Ofgem to limit the scope of energy companies to charge unjustified prices; notes that the poorest and most vulnerable groups continue to pay higher prices for electricity and gas, particularly those with prepayment meters where charges amount to an average differential of &pound;118 compared to customers paying by direct debit, and that a significant percentage of some groups at risk of fuel poverty use prepayment meters, including 22% of households with an income of less than &pound;10,000; calls for tighter regulatory laws in the future, including windfall taxes or fines as a tool of regulation for utility companies that fail to comply, and believes that Ofgem could go further by insisting that energy companies absorb the comparatively small operational costs for prepayment meters and standard credit payment methods in order to achieve a more level and fairer system of pricing.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3799</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>EHRC Helpline Advice Service Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the Equality and Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s (EHRC) proposal to cut 50 posts from its helpline advice service, including the restructuring of its Scotland office resulting in the loss of four full-time equivalent posts; believes that this decision is ill timed with the number of calls to the EHRC helpline increasing due to the recession; is further concerned that women, people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, disabled people and carers will be particularly disadvantaged by this decision, and calls on the EHRC to review its plans and to do more to promote this service so that those people already at a disadvantage are not further disadvantaged by these inopportune cutbacks.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3796.1</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>The NHS and the Independent Sector</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3796) in the name of Mary Scanlon, leave out from &quot;and pays&quot; to end and insert &quot;with its high level of patient approval and welcomes the Scottish Regional Treatment Centre&rsquo;s contribution to maintaining Stracathro Hospital as both a local and regional resource; notes the success of the nationalisation of the HCI hospital in Clydebank, now the Golden Jubilee National Hospital, and recognises the contribution of both these units and their staff in achieving the continuing reduction in waiting times.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3796.2</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>The NHS and the Independent Sector</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3796) in the name of Mary Scanlon, insert at end&nbsp;&quot;, while ensuring that the use of the private sector does not destabilise local NHS provision or undermine the recruitment and retention of NHS staff.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3796.3</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>The NHS and the Independent Sector</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3796) in the name of Mary Scanlon, leave out from &quot;success&quot; to end and insert &quot;Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to a mutual NHS in Scotland and its decision only to use the private sector for health provision at the margins where necessary; further welcomes the fact that there has been a 37% drop in private sector acute activity, excluding Stracathro, between 2006 and 2008 and congratulates NHS staff for achieving this reduction; notes the role of the private treatment centre pilot at Stracathro, established by the last administration, and awaits the final evaluation of this pilot, and commends the Scottish Government policy to direct investment into the NHS rather than divert scarce resources into private sector health provision.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3778.1</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Alcohol Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3778) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from &quot;any changes&quot; to end and insert &quot;tackling Scotland&rsquo;s complex relationship with alcohol will require significant and long-term cultural change, and believes that any proposals for reform of the law should be targeted and evidence-based, introduced on the basis of strong public support and following meaningful consultation with all relevant interests and stakeholders to ensure that measures to address problematic alcohol consumption do not unfairly penalise the majority of individuals who enjoy alcohol responsibly.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3778.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Alcohol Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3778) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from &quot;binge drinking&quot; to end and insert &quot;harmful drinking and under-age drinking must be workable and properly targeted so that, while the responsible, sensible majority of moderate drinkers are not unnecessarily penalised, wider issues of excess consumption contributing to huge costs to Scottish society are effectively addressed.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3752</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Eating Out with Coeliac Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that people with coeliac disease have an autoimmune disease for which the only treatment is a lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet; considers that *59%* of people diagnosed with coeliac disease are most concerned about the lack of safe gluten-free options offered in restaurants and similar places; urges chefs and caterers to improve the availability of gluten-free choices, and commends and supports Coeliac UK for its eating out campaign to make eating out possible for people with the condition, which will significantly improve their quality of life and create more business for the hospitality sector.</p>
