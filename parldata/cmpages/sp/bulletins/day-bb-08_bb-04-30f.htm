<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#END">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1814</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>The Impact of the UK Budget on Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disappointed with some of the decisions taken in the 2008 UK Budget and their damaging impact on the Scottish economy and households; in particular regrets that action was not taken to reverse the 2007 decision to abolish the 10p tax rate; notes with concern the increase in the small companies&rsquo; rate of corporation tax; believes that the blanket approach taken in setting alcohol duty is too simplistic and does not address the wider social and health issues around alcohol; regrets that the measures aimed at tackling fuel poverty are insufficient, and further regrets the lack of appropriate measures to moderate the impact of rising fuel prices.</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1813</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Union Learning Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish Union Learning Academy which will provide a renewed focus on and a better platform for union-supported workers&rsquo; education; congratulates the initiative shown by the STUC in allocating the &pound;1.4 million of resources it has received from the Scottish Government, &pound;800,000 to the Scottish Union Learning Fund and &pound;600,000 to the STUC&rsquo;s Skills and Lifelong Learning Team, and looks forward to seeing workers taking advantage of the opportunities afforded them.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1812</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the failure of the Scottish Government to actively pursue and promote housing stock transfer by local authorities to community-based housing associations and thereby obtain a debt write-off from HM Treasury of over &pound;2 billion; believes that the role of social landlords is best undertaken by housing associations and other not-for-profit, co-operative bodies, and deplores the introduction of any further restrictions on the right to buy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1811#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Passport Office</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the plans to stop passport-processing services in Glasgow, resulting in the loss of over 100 jobs and leaving Scotland without a fully operational passport service; notes with further concern what appears to have been a deliberate run-down of the service in the lead-up to this announcement; believes that this streamlining process will see a further three or four passport offices throughout the United Kingdom affected, and further believes that concise information as to the effect of these changes should be issued immediately in order to remove the doubt and uncertainty surrounding the plans.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1810&diams;</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Community Radio</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the valuable and unique role of Scottish community radio in delivering small-scale, not-for-profit radio stations operated for the benefit of the general public and of particular communities; congratulates Leith FM, which celebrates its first year of broadcasting in May 2008 and which has epitomised the spirit of community radio by actively engaging with community groups and building relationships with other community stations, including Sunny Govan, Radio Awaz in Glasgow and Black Diamond Radio in Midlothian, and welcomes the continued expansion of the network of Scottish community radio stations across the country in providing a voice for Scotland&rsquo;s culturally, linguistically and geographically diverse communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1809</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Stop Bickering and Start Building</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that there are currently 45 school building contracts under way across Scotland; notes that the Minister for Schools and Skills, Maureen Watt MSP, accepts that all 45 contracts were under negotiation prior to May 2007; condemns the fact that not a single new school has been initiated by the SNP government in the last 12 months and is very concerned about the lack of progress in Liberal Democrat/SNP-led City of Edinburgh Council; avers that Edinburgh&rsquo;s Lib Dem councillors and SNP ministers consistently blame each other for the lack of progress while the city&rsquo;s 12 SNP councillors remain silent; believes that the City of Edinburgh Council Education Convener&rsquo;s plan to demand more money from the SNP government will be fruitless and worries that unless rapid progress is made soon, not a single new school initiated since May 2007 will open its doors before the next election; further believes that the Scottish Futures Trust is a white elephant and ill-thought through; hopes that ministers will see sense and put the needs of Scotland&rsquo;s parents and pupils ahead of grandstanding, and calls on the SNP to start building schools again.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1804</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
<p>Groups 1 to 3: 40 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1803</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Food Security</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the potential for global food shortages; notes the recent cost increases in many basic food products here in Scotland, with food price inflation now exceeding 6%; further notes that many developing countries are experiencing growing social unrest as a result of food pressures, and calls on the Scottish Government, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government, the European Union and other relevant bodies to work closely, and with the appropriate urgency, to seek solutions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1802</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Isle of Arran Wildlife Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament strongly supports the Isle of Arran Wildlife Festival, being held this year from 14 to 21 May; notes the hard work put in by the community of Arran, in association with VisitArran, RSPB Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage with 14 other partners ranging from CalMac and Stagecoach to Arran Natural History Society and the Community of Arran Seabed Trust; is aware that scores of interesting and exciting events will take place during the festival including walks, talks, boat explorations, minibus safaris, bird, squirrel, bat, reptile, butterfly, deer and seal watching, beach cleaning, kayaking, ceramic tile painting, art exhibitions, films, distillery tours, an optics demonstration, lino cutting and t-shirt printing; is aware that the vast majority of events are free, suitable for people of all ages and not too physically demanding; knows that a warm welcome awaits visitors to Arran and the festival in particular, and invites people to visit the beautiful island of Arran during the festival, enjoy themselves and return again soon.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1801&diams;</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Towards an Inclusive Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by Lintel Trust, Glasgow, of <em>A Resource Guide For Housing Associations In Promoting Black And Minority Ethnic Participation In Governance Structures</em> building upon the findings of the previous report <em>From Rhetoric to Reality</em> which identified that, despite the existence of guidance regarding their involvement in governance arrangements, BME people were still excluded from or under-represented in such bodies, and believes that this excellent resource effectively brings together the many strands of guidance and good practice available and will serve to aid inclusive living leading to stronger local communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1800</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Dutch Organic Foods Public Procurement Standards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, in addition to encouraging consumers to buy organic products, the Dutch Government will play its own part in boosting demand for organic products by ensuring that all government procurement must be sustainably sourced from 2010 onward with a minimum of 40% organic content and that the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture has agreed to source 75% of food at its canteens from organic suppliers; further notes that the previous administration agreed an organic farming action plan in 2003, and calls on the Scottish Government to set the same standards in public procurement across Scotland as are now being set in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-1798</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Membership of Commission on Scottish Devolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with disappointment the membership of the Commission on Scottish Devolution; is aware that the commission purports to comprise &quot;the range of pro-Union opinion in Scotland&quot;, according to the Scotland Office; notes that of 15 members on the commission, five are members of the House of Lords and two are knights of the realm, hardly a cross-section of Scottish society, and believes that the National Conversation, which welcomes input from Scots of all opinions and from all walks of life, is a better vehicle for addressing Scotland&rsquo;s constitutional future than the hand-picked unionist clique who form the commission.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1798.1</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Membership of Commission on Scottish Devolution</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1798) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the historic first meeting of the Commission on Scottish Devolution, with its wide-ranging membership, representative both of political parties who support effective Home Rule for Scotland within the United Kingdom and of wider civic society; wishes the commission well in its important work of reviewing the powers of the Parliament against the background of the success of the Home Rule settlement, and believes that the commission is solidly based on a resolution of the Scottish Parliament and the support of a substantial majority of MSPs, unlike the National Conversation set up by the current Scottish Government which has no parliamentary or popular mandate.&quot;</p>
