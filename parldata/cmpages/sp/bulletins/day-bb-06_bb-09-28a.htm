<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish National Party Debate: Trident&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4864</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Trident</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that there is no justification for the renewal or replacement of the Trident nuclear weapons system. </p>
<p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4864.5</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4864) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert&nbsp;&quot;notes that decisions pertaining to national defence, such as any future replacement of Trident, are reserved to the Westminster&nbsp;parliament; notes that the United Nations Security Council plays a vital role in working for peace and security on a global basis; welcomes the United Kingdom&rsquo;s role within both the United Nations and NATO; notes that the General Election manifestos for 2005 of the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties called for the retention of an independent nuclear deterrent; believes that there should be the widest possible debate on the future security of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the wider world, covering all options on Trident, including non-replacement; notes the comments of the UK Government that no decisions on replacing Trident have yet been taken; welcomes the significant reductions in the&nbsp;UK&rsquo;s nuclear weapons arsenal; is committed to the goal of the global elimination of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, and wishes to see the United Kingdom continue to work both bilaterally and through the United Nations to urge states not yet party to non-proliferation instruments to become so, to remain committed to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and to make further progress toward significant reductions in the nuclear arsenals of the major nuclear powers.&quot; </p>
<p> <strong>S2M-4864.3</strong> <strong>Euan Robson: Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4864) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;wishes to see the worldwide elimination of nuclear weapons; notes the UK Government&rsquo;s commitment, made in June 2005, to reach a decision on the replacement of the Trident system by the end of the current Westminster Parliament; further notes that the Secretary of State for Defence stated in June 2005 that &quot;no decision on any replacement for Trident has been taken, either in principle or otherwise&quot;; calls on the UK Government to ensure that there is a full public debate on the issue; further calls on the UK Government to press for a new round of multilateral arms reduction talks, and believes that the United Kingdom&rsquo;s current minimum nuclear deterrent should be retained for the foreseeable future until sufficient progress has been made towards the global elimination of nuclear weapons.&quot; </p>
<p> <strong>S2M-4864.4</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance: Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4864) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, insert at end &quot;but also recognises the concerns of workforce unions, such as the GMB, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to prepare Scotland for a weapons of mass destruction-free future by producing a plan for the redeployment of workers, such as at Faslane and Coulport, for peaceful purposes.&quot; </p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish National Party Debate: Small Businesses&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4863</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Small Businesses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the critically important role that small businesses play in delivering economic growth and local services and confirms the need to deliver specific tangible measures to bolster the competitiveness of Scottish small businesses, such as the SNP&rsquo;s recent Small Business Bonus Scheme which would result in 120,000 small businesses being freed from the burden of business rates, and also recognises that, in implementing such schemes, it will help to increase the viability of individual small businesses and contribute to creating the growth that would allow Scotland&rsquo;s living standards to converge on the higher living standards enjoyed elsewhere, thereby encouraging yet more small business start-ups, creating many more jobs, widening the tax base, increasing local economic vibrancy and improving local services and confidence across Scotland. </p>
<p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4863.2</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson: Small Businesses</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4863) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;critically important&quot; to end and insert &quot;central role that small businesses play in delivering both economic growth and local services and welcomes the success that the Scottish Executive has had in supporting the growth in the total employment and overall number of small businesses and new business start-ups in Scotland since 1999; welcomes the benefit that small firms gain from a range of grant schemes that encourage the development of new products and processes, the creation or safeguarding of jobs and becoming more energy efficient, and also welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s Small Business Rates Relief Scheme that results in around 70% of non-domestic rate subjects in Scotland receiving rates relief of up to 50% and the decision to equalise the poundage with England from 1 April 2007, which demonstrates our determination to deliver the right conditions for all businesses to grow by encouraging yet more small business start-ups, creating more jobs, widening the tax base, increasing local economic activity and improving local services across Scotland.&quot; </p>
<p> <strong>S2M-4863.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Small Businesses</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4863) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;confirms&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that there is a need for government to create a business environment which will improve the competitiveness of Scottish small businesses; further believes that any detailed proposals to reduce the business rate burden for small businesses should be properly costed and the source of such monies identified; notes the impact of excessive regulation and poor levels of investment in infrastructure on the capacity of small businesses to grow; calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward policies to create a more business-friendly environment in Scotland, and notes that the introduction of a local income tax as proposed by the SNP and the Liberal Democrats would directly penalise hundreds of thousands of unincorporated small businesses throughout Scotland.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<p> Debate on the Subject of&mdash; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-4742</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Withdrawal of Alimta for Mesothelioma Patients</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&rsquo;s (NICE) final appraisal determination on Alimta does not recommend Alimta for the treatment of mesothelioma except as part of ongoing or new clinical trials; is concerned that the drug could potentially be withdrawn if NICE repeats that opinion in its final report due to be published in October 2006; realises that, in practice, NICE&rsquo;s decisions ordinarily supersede Scottish advice which could lead to the withdrawal of this drug for Scottish sufferers; recognises that such a move would have a devastating effect on mesothelioma sufferers here in Scotland given that Alimta has been shown to be effective in increasing life expectancy and improving the quality of life of patients; is aware that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) will be reviewing its decision to offer the drug in Scotland in light of the NICE recommendation; therefore urges NHS QIS to recognise the contextual differences in Scotland, such as in epidemiology, with a large concentration of mesothelioma cases in Dundee and other post-industrial areas of Scotland; furthermore recognises the existing advice from the Scottish Medicines Consortium that Alimta should be freely available in Scotland, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should guarantee the availability of Alimta to existing and future sufferers of mesothelioma in Scotland. </p>
