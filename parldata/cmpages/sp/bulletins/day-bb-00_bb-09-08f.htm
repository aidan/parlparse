            Trafficking of Women</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its deep concern 
            at the trafficking of an estimated 300,000 young women into Central 
            Europe and the European Union (EU) each year; is alarmed that hundreds 
            of these women are murdered and thousands are coerced into debt bondage 
            and prostitution; notes that false promises of legitimate employment 
            and a better life are used by smuggling gangs to lure women from communities 
            submerged in desperate poverty; calls for a common penalty for trafficking 
            to be adopted across the EU; recognises the need to provide additional 
            resources for the United Nations body <i>The International Organisation 
            for Migration</i> for its campaign to educate women and girls on the 
            risks of trafficking and to provide medical and psychiatric help, 
            witness protection and safe houses for those fleeing pimps, and acknowledges 
            that the problem of trafficking can only be solved by addressing the 
            disproportionate impact of poverty on women in the former Soviet Union 
            which feeds the supply of this traffic in human misery.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1160#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: 
            Permitted Telecommunications Developments</strong>-That the Parliament 
            expresses its concern over the proliferation of &quot;permitted development&quot; 
            notices which local authorities have received on behalf of telecommunications 
            companies since the report of the Transport and the Environment Committee 
            on telecommunications developments; views the inability of local authorities 
            to control the siting of these &quot;permitted developments&quot; 
            as a temporary loophole in the planning process and asks that the 
            telecommunications companies involved, specifically those who have 
            served notices to erect three masts near Stepps Primary School in 
            the Coatbridge &amp; Chryston constituency, conduct meaningful consultation 
            with the local communities affected on the siting of these masts and, 
            where agreement cannot be reached, impose a voluntary moratorium on 
            their siting until such times as new planning legislation is brought 
            forward.</font></p>

            The Seed Potatoes (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (SSI 2000/201)</strong>-That

            under The Seed Potatoes (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (SSI 2000/201).

            recommends that nothing further be done under the Prisons and Young 
            Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Amendment Rules 2000 (SSI 2000/187).</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1156#</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: 
            Common Fisheries Policy Reform and Zonal Management</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the importance to Shetland of its fishing industry which 
            supports vital employment in the fish catching, processing and ancillary 
            sectors; notes that to provide a stable future a complete review of 
            fisheries conservation and management policies is urgently needed, 
            and commends to the Scottish Executive the proposals for zonal management 
            put forward by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1155</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: 
            Greenwich Dome</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the profligate waste 
            of public money on the Greenwich Dome; calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to make urgent representations to Her Majesty's Government and the 
            National Lottery authorities in support of an immediate moratorium 
            on any future funding and the immediate closure of the Dome, and notes 
            that this ill conceived and wasteful project has been constantly opposed 
            by the majority of Scots since its inception and that the effect of 
            its vast lottery funding has been to cruelly deprive numerous good 
            causes of desperately needed financial support. </font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1154</strong> <strong>Des McNulty: 
            Third World Debt</strong>-That the Parliament notes the widespread support 
            amongst the people of Scotland for the Jubilee 2000 Campaign to cancel 
            unpayable Third World Debt; appreciates that the Chancellor of the 
            Exchequer and the Secretary of State for International Development 
            have led the way in moves for debt relief, and urges the international 
            community to set an accelerated timetable at the IMF/World Bank meeting 
            in Prague for releasing the world's heavily indebted poor countries 
            from the burden of debt repayments, while ensuring that the benefits 
            of debt relief reach the poor.</font></p>

            Gulf War Related Illnesses</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continuing 
            concern being expressed by veterans of the Gulf War that multiple 
            vaccines given to Gulf War troops, oil-fire related pollution, depleted 
            uranium used in shells and possible pollution from destroyed Iraqi 
            chemical and biological weapon sites may be responsible for the illnesses 
            known as Gulf War related illnesses; further notes the evidence from 
            the British Medical Journal and research undertaken by the Gulf War 
            Research Unit at Kings College, London to this effect, and asks the 
            Scottish Executive to ensure that each NHS health board, Trust and 
            local authority is provided with appropriate advice and guidance recognising 
            the existence of the &quot;related illnesses&quot; and instructing 
            them to ensure that proper and adequate resources are allocated to 
            improving the quality of life for those Gulf War veterans who are

            same local call charge, considers that the existence of its 0845 number 
            as an option for phoning its exchange should be publicised more vigorously, 
            and requests the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to examine 
            whether the Parliament should go over to an 0345 or 0845 number so 
            that all calls to it are at the local call rate.</font></p>
