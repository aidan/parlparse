            of a British football team to replace the English, Northern Irish, 
            Scottish and Welsh teams and agrees that such a team should be formed 
            with the following provisos: that the &quot;all Britain&quot; team 
            be named &quot;Scotland&quot;; holds all home matches in Scotland; 
            plays in dark blue; is managed by Craig Brown; ensures positive discrimination

            one has been convicted of his murder; believes that this case highlights 
            the institutional racism within the legal system in Scotland, and 
            supports the call from the Chhokar family for a full and independent

            as a whole; notes that since 1993 Balnain House has hosted over 500 
            concerts, has provided an intensive education programme of 15 different 
            classes which run throughout 36 weeks of the year, has been used as 
            an education outreach centre for 12 local schools, has developed as 
            a meeting point, and has generally come to be regarded as a unique 
            centre of Highland and Scottish culture; notes that Balnain House 
            has received little financial support from the Scottish Arts Council 
            (SAC), and urges both the SAC and the Scottish Executive to give immediate 
            consideration to finding a means to ensure that Balnain House can
