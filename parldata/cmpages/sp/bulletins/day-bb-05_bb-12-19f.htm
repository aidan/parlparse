<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3747</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>HMV/Waterstone&rsquo;s Acquisition of Ottakar&rsquo;s plc Referred to the Competition Commission</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about  loss of competition in the large book retailer market; congratulates the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for referring the acquisition of Ottakar&rsquo;s Bookstores by the HMV Group to the Competition Commission; agrees with the OFT that &quot;UK book-buyers value the fruits of this competition, which this merger would eliminate&quot;, and calls on the Competition Commission to prevent the merger.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3746</strong> <strong>Des McNulty on behalf of the Finance Committee:</strong> <strong>5th Report (Session 2) of the Finance Committee, Stage 2 of the 2006-07 Budget Process</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 5th Report 2005 (Session 2) of the Finance Committee on Stage 2 of the 2006-07 Budget Process (SP Paper 471) and refers the report and its recommendations to the Scottish Executive for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3745</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>ChildLine Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates ChildLine, who last year helped over 30,000 vulnerable children; notes that it was unable to answer another 22,500 calls from vulnerable and lonely children; recognises the need for both financial and practical aid; further notes the plans for ChildLine to join the NSPCC next year and for ChildLine Scotland to join the NSPCC&rsquo;s sister organisation, Children 1ST; notes, however, that in Scotland, of the 170 children that call each day, counsellors can help only a little over half of these threatened young people; supports the proposal for ChildLine Scotland to join Children 1ST, and agrees that everything should be done to support those of our children who are lonely and vulnerable, especially at Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3744#</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the many opportunities to improve community safety provided under the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 and other initiatives, such as Safer Routes to School; congratulates community safety partnerships, such as that in Fife, for the innovative ways in which they have developed local schemes; notes that initiatives, such as Fife&rsquo;s Time2Act Safer Neighbourhoods campaign, cover a wide range of community safety matters such as safety of older people, women&rsquo;s personal safety, reduction in domestic violence, drink driving and drunk pedestrians, safety of children and young people, safer town centres and neighbourhoods and support for victims of crime and anti-social behaviour; acknowledges the work done by public sector staff, uniformed services and many members of local communities to develop and support such schemes; believes that there is further scope for developments in this area, and considers that all concerned should continue to work together to make Scotland&rsquo;s communities safer.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3743</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Welcome Decision of Edinburgh Council Tenants to Reject Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of City of Edinburgh Council tenants to vote against housing stock transfer; believes the decision of 53% against to 47% for the transfer represents a victory for people power against all the odds and is a hammer blow against the privatisation of public housing provision throughout Britain, and demands that the &pound;1 billion, which was apparently available for privatisation, should now be available to write off the council&rsquo;s housing debt, to invest in improvements to the existing housing stock and to build 6,000 affordable, quality, publicly owned houses that the city badly needs.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3742</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Northfield Girls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Emma Thomson, Lynsey White, Krista Cairns and Kimberley Ingles from Northfield in Aberdeen for their great achievement in winning first prize at the National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Awards, sponsored by Kids Club Direct and Scottish Power Learning, in Glasgow on 10 December 2005 and recognises the excellent work carried out by the young girls who provide the Northfield Community Disco and play at various community venues on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3740</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Climate Change College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Edinburgh University Students&rsquo; Association President, Ruth Cameron, has won a competition organised by WWF, ice-cream makers Ben and Jerry, and polar explorer, Marc Cornelissen, to become an international speaker on climate change; further notes that Ms Cameron beat more than 1,000 other candidates from across Europe to win one of the six places at the &quot;Climate Change College&quot;; congratulates Ms Cameron on her success, and wishes her well at her training session in Greenland in the spring.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3739</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Home Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that some local education authorities in Scotland are not adhering to the statutory guidance on the circumstances in which parents may choose to educate their children at home which was issued by the Scottish Executive in March 2004 with the aim of improving relationships between local authorities and home-educating families; notes that, while the majority of councils have changed their policies, procedures and practices to reflect the statutory guidance, many others have delayed or refused consent to parents wishing to withdraw their children from school, despite those parents having provided adequate information about their home-based education provision; notes that in England and Wales the law allows for the deregistration of a pupil from any school upon written demand, whereas in Scotland parents require council consent to remove their child from a state, but not a private, school; commends the majority of councils in Scotland for engaging positively with home-educating families and making the guidance work, and supports Schoolhouse and the home education community in Scotland in their call for an amendment to section 35 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 so that children attending state schools in Scotland may be withdrawn from state schools upon written notification to the local authority.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3737</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Tackling Child Obesity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is shocked by the new figures indicating that one third of children in Scotland are overweight; notes that the figures are constantly increasing; believes that free healthy school meals for all of Scotland&rsquo;s children would be a major weapon in the battle to promote healthy eating and to establish healthy eating habits from a young age; notes that time is not on our side and that Finland implemented this policy over 20 years ago and saw huge health improvements within a generation, and considers that Scotland has no time to lose.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3736</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Iraq: 1,000 Days Under Occupation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the passing of the 1,000th day since the invasion of Iraq by US and British military forces on 20 March 2003; notes that, despite President Bush declaring that major hostilities were over on 1 May 2003, 183,000 British and American troops remain in action at the end of 2005; further notes that the United States of America has spent over $204 billion on the war so far but has totally failed in its promise to reconstruct Iraq after the war; recognises that the biggest issue facing Iraqis today is personal safety, with criminal gangs and death squads bringing a complete breakdown in law and order; notes that many Iraqis who initially welcomed the overthrow of Saddam Hussein have been humiliated and brutalised by the occupying forces who have conducted full body searches of Muslim women in front of men and in their own bedrooms, have entered mosques without removing their boots, have used mass arrests of young men and held them without charge for months on end and have routinely used torture in prisons such as Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca; further notes reports from Iraq that show that the occupying forces are using air strikes, tanks and artillery against civilian targets, including the use of white phosphorus during the actions in Fallujah, which have been described as war crimes; believes that it is the actions of the US and British military forces that are driving Iraqis to resist the occupation politically, physically and through trade union action; notes the magnificent work of Iraqi non-governmental organisations, such as International Peace Angels, who bring medical and humanitarian aid to Iraqis who find themselves caught up in the fighting, and believes that the situation in Iraq can come to a positive outcome if the occupying forces are withdrawn immediately and Iraqis are able to determine the future of their country, free from foreign occupation.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3735#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Closure of Six Post Offices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern over Post Office Ltd&rsquo;s announcement that it will be closing six town centre post offices, including the main post office in Dumfries, replacing them with franchises in SPAR shops; notes that SPAR itself is a franchise; is concerned over the implications for staff numbers and terms and conditions of employment; believes that in cases such as Dumfries the new location is less convenient for customers; further believes that the proposed arrangements may not offer a sustainable and long-term future for these post offices; expresses concern that the announcement was made less than two weeks before Christmas and considers that Post Office Ltd should extend the consultation period beyond the current seven weeks to ensure that all customers get the opportunity to express their views, and believes that no irreversible decisions should be made without paying full consideration and attention to the views of customers and staff.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3734</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Central Heating</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the coming winter is predicted to be one of the coldest in recent years; further notes that many pensioners and people on low incomes in Scotland have already had their central heating systems upgraded, paid for and installed as part of the Warm Deal and the central heating programme but is concerned that a significant number of people are having to wait many months for inspections, surveys or work relating to the schemes to be carried out; believes that at least some of the delays are due to work only being able to be carried out by companies approved and contracted to Eaga Partnership Ltd and further believes that more work could be carried out by local contractors, thus reducing some of the waiting times, and calls on the Scottish Executive to look at the possibility of local companies playing a larger role in installations and also in the delivery of the scheme in general to ensure that those entitled elderly or vulnerable people in Scotland get the heating system they desperately need.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3733</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Support Mehmet Tarhan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports and sends solidarity to Mehmet Tarhan, a gay Turkish conscientious objector, who was sentenced to four years&rsquo; custody in a Turkish prison for &quot;refusing orders in front of the (military) unit&quot;; is gravely concerned that Mr Tarhan has been on hunger strike for a month in protest at being brutally beaten and cut by prison officers; notes that he has refused to join the army and is one of the 350,000 to 500,000 draft refusers in Turkey, many of whom are Kurds who refuse to join the army which attacks Kurdish people in the south east; notes that in June 2005 a judge offered to release Mr Tarhan on the grounds of his homosexuality, which he refused; is extremely concerned that the &quot;evidence&quot; demanded by the military to prove homosexuality includes an anal examination; demands an end to the torture of Mehmet Tarhan, and further demands his immediate release from the Turkish army.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3732#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Childhood Obesity in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at recent findings published by NHS Scotland which suggest that the proportion of Scottish children who are overweight, obese and severely obese is far higher than anticipated in all age groups and is twice that of the expected UK average; recognises this means that more than a third of our 12-year-olds were considered to be overweight last year, 19.4% were considered to be obese and 11.2% severely obese; accepts that these figures represent a potential time bomb for the NHS in terms of the future costs of the treatment of obesity and related illness; acknowledges the commitment by the Scottish Executive to tackle this problem; considers that more robust measures are needed, such as investing further in the promotion of breastfeeding as the healthiest start in life, removing unhealthy dietary choices from our school environments and increasing the focus and commitment to physical activity in our schools; acknowledges that examples of best practice exist, such as South Coatbridge&rsquo;s Healthy Lifestyle Project, and believes that, in light of these findings, a national debate is needed to re-examine all possible options and means of making progress on this issue.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3728#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Loss of Teaching Posts in Glasgow Nursery Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns proposals from Glasgow City Council to transfer qualified nursery teachers out of nursery school education and into mainstream primary education, thereby leaving the city&rsquo;s pre-five education in the hands of less qualified staff, as part of the savings options for Glasgow Education Services&rsquo; budget proposals; recognises the high level of commitment displayed whereby a nursery teacher must first attain a full teaching qualification followed by a further specialist qualification; recognises also that with the experience gained a nursery teacher will identify educational and behavioural difficulties which can be corrected at an early stage thereby benefiting the child and society as a whole, and believes that a duty of care is owed to at least maintain present levels of provision of nursery teachers as the bedrock for all levels of educational services.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Matheson</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3719</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>UNISON Supports More Powers for the Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes <em>Devolution - The Next Stage, </em>published by UNISON&rsquo;s Scottish Committee; welcomes its support for more powers for the Parliament in areas such as equal opportunities, energy, council tax benefit, firearms, drugs, immigration and broadcasting, believing that such powers would be used more progressively by the Scottish Parliament than Westminster; congratulates UNISON on its open-minded and flexible approach to more powers for the people of Scotland and their Parliament; agrees with the statement that devolution is a &quot;process not an event&quot;; further believes that this process will not stop at devolution and that independence for Scotland is inevitable, and looks forward to that day when the people of Scotland flex their right to self-determination and assume all the powers currently vested in Westminster and the Crown for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3718</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Councils in Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that COSLA and individual local authorities have declared that the local government finance settlement is insufficient to secure public services, jobs, terms and conditions or to achieve long-overdue settlement of equal pay; notes that Glasgow City Council has already announced cuts in services to vulnerable members of the community and job losses, whilst offering inadequate compensation for years of pay discrimination against women; further notes that Falkirk Council has indicated that it will be facing a shortfall of at least &pound;2 million in the next financial year and has warned about cuts to services, such as emergency home care, even before any payments are made in relation to equal pay; believes that councils up and down the country may well follow suit, leading to disruption as trade unionists rightly mobilise to defend their members and services; believes that in no way should underpaid women be forced to choose between equal pay and the jobs and terms and conditions of their colleagues; affirms the responsibility of government and employers to implement equal pay by making adequate resources available, and believes that the Scottish Executive should convene a meeting, or meetings, between COSLA, individual local authorities and the trade unions to achieve a solution to this brewing crisis with the intention of delivering on equal pay, protecting public services and securing the jobs and terms and conditions of all local authority employees.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3717</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No. 18) (Scotland) Order 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No. 18) (Scotland) Order 2005 (SSI 2005/626) be approved.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3715#</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Hill of Brathens, Banchory</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by the Natural Environment Research Council to close the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) at Hill of Brathens, Banchory; notes that the research carried out at the facility is consistently of the highest quality; considers that, at a time when climate change is of huge concern in Scotland, research operations such as CEH should be expanded rather than rationalised, and further considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Natural Environment Research Council opposing the proposal.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3714</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Strike Action by Irish Trade Unions Against Irish Ferries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that over 100,000 workers marched in Ireland on Friday 9 December 2005, with 60,000 in Dublin alone, to protest against attempts by the Irish Ferries company to re-flag their ships to Cyprus in an attempt to slash the conditions of the ferry workers and undermine the basic minimum wage; congratulates the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for organising the protest which resulted in the widest industrial action seen in Ireland for 20 years; believes that this action exposes the real agenda of the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot; economy and proves that working class solidarity can take on big business and at the same time cut across racist sentiments against immigrant workers, and gives its full support to workers on Scottish ferries who may face similar attacks on their wages and conditions in future.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3699.1</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Scotch Beef</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3699) in the name of Mr Andrew Arbuckle, insert at end &quot;and believes that Liberal Democrat and Labour ministers could and should have acted sooner to alleviate the plight of Scottish beef farmers.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3698#</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Gas Work Notification Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the introduction by CORGI of a mandatory notification scheme for all new gas installations in April of this year; further notes that, whilst supporting all measures which genuinely improve gas safety standards, the Gas Work Notification Scheme does not serve to improve standards or to tackle cowboy traders, that it was conceived around the requirements of the Home Information Pack which will apply only in England and Wales and that it places a wholly unnecessary time and cost burden on Scottish registered gas installers, which in turn places an additional cost burden on their major customers, such as Scottish housing associations and local authorities, with no benefit to the Scottish customer; is concerned at the implications of the scheme for gas installers and consumers in Angus; is further concerned that the scheme was introduced by CORGI without due consultation with Scottish member organisations, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that this scheme is withdrawn from Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3648.1</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Happy Birthday Sweet 16?</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3648) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;charitable work&quot; to end and insert &quot;work providing grants to families with disabled or seriously ill children up to the age of 16 for items that are not the responsibility of a statutory agency; agrees that the stresses and strains placed on families caring for a disabled or ill child do not disappear on the young person&rsquo;s 16th birthday and that the loss of this grant has a severe impact on the quality of life for these children and their families, and calls for the funding of the Family Fund to be increased in proportion to needs in Scotland to allow the organisation to extend its remit to help families with children over 16, recognising that the state should be providing far more support and resources for these vulnerable families.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3407#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Earthquake in Kashmir</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deepest sympathy for the victims of the earthquake affecting Kashmir and Pakistan&rsquo;s North-West Frontier Province which took place on Saturday 8 October 2005; recognises that many families *in the west of Scotland and across Scotland as a whole* will have lost relatives and friends as a result of the tragedy or are awaiting information about those who are missing; congratulates Islamic Relief and other charitable organisations on their swift response, and welcomes the steps taken by the UK Government to provide urgent assistance to the affected areas.</p>
