<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3386</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>The Local Government Finance Act 1992 (Scotland) Order 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government Finance Act 1992 (Scotland) Order 2009 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3385</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Early Years Framework</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that getting the early years right is key to delivering improved outcomes for children and young people and a key opportunity to shape a more successful Scotland; notes the publication of&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;Early&nbsp;Years&nbsp;Framework</em> and the vision it sets out for giving children the best start in life, including a focus on parenting, early intervention, meeting the needs of children and parents and play; further recognises the challenges in shifting to prevention and early intervention while also supporting children who need help now, and calls on national and local government to work together to address these challenges in partnership during the&nbsp;implementation of the framework.</p>
<p>Supported by: Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3384</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Finance Sector Jobs Taskforce</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of the financial services industry to the Scottish economy; believes that the Financial Services Advisory Board (FiSAB), set up to be the custodian and advocate of the strategy for the industry in Scotland during a time of economic boom, should now be given more powers and a new purpose to focus on protection for this major Scottish industry during the current banking crisis and recession; notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment that FiSAB should be adapted to deal with the challenges in the sector and should meet more frequently than the present position of twice a year, and calls for the urgent formation of a finance sector jobs taskforce within FiSAB to work proactively to help the staff with essential skills who are losing their jobs and for ministers to report to the Parliament on its work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3383</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Borrowing Powers for the Scottish Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the acquisition of borrowing powers would enhance the autonomy and accountability of the Scottish Parliament and improve the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ability to respond to changing economic circumstances; notes that borrowing powers would allow the Scottish Government to phase the funding of major capital projects such as the new Forth Replacement Crossing sensibly and efficiently, and therefore welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to give permission for civil servants to engage fully with the Commission on Scottish Devolution to assist the delivery of borrowing powers for the Scottish Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3382</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Better Representation of Easterhouse and Castlemilk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the unfavourable and inaccurate description of Easterhouse and Castlemilk as &quot;beautiful names, scummy estates&quot; by <em>Spectator</em> journalist Fraser Nelson on Coffee House, the <em>Spectator</em> blog, on 30 January 2009; regrets that areas in the east end of Glasgow rarely feature positively in the national press; calls for journalists to address the exemplary voluntary service and commitment of local residents and the hard work of teachers and community organisations that contribute to the development and regeneration of this part of Glasgow, and acknowledges that, while there are many problems to be overcome, the area would benefit from a less dismissive response from high-profile journalists and greater accolades for its achievements.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3381</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Budget (Scotland) (No.3) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Budget (Scotland) (No.3) Bill be treated as an Emergency Bill.</p>

<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3371&diams; </strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Bicentenary of Louis Braille</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 200th anniversary of the birth of Louis Braille, inventor of the unique communication system for blind people that has been instrumental in unlocking knowledge and potential, creating opportunities and supporting independent action from the time of its invention to the present day; notes the importance of providing braille and other forms of accessible information to people with visual impairments across all sectors and in all areas of activity to create a fair and inclusive society; also notes the potential of modern technology to give full effect to Louise Braille&rsquo;s vision of effective communication for blind and visually impaired people, and considers that the Scottish Government has an important role as an exemplar of best practice in relation to the accessibility to visually impaired people of public services and information provision across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3370</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Irvine Burns Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Irvine Burns Club on its work in promoting the works and philosophy of Robert Burns since its establishment in 1826, in particular its holding of annual wits&rsquo; dinners to raise funds for capital projects, and congratulates the club on the unveiling of a magnificent bronze of Burns and Wallace on 25 January 2009 to mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3369</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Guant&aacute;namo Bay and Diego Garcia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by President Obama to close the Guant&aacute;namo Bay detention facility; considers that, while this goes some way to restoring the reputation of the United States of America for upholding justice and human rights, the US Government should also close Camp Justice on Diego Garcia and, together with the UK Government, assist the repatriation of those who were forcibly displaced by the latter, should they wish to return, and further calls on both governments to offer the former inhabitants of Diego Garcia and their descendants meaningful compensation for their suffering.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3368</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Supporting Young People in Art</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Tramway for the Street Art Project in Pollokshields, the Village Storytelling Centre for the Sharing Stories project in Pollok and Clydebank Housing Association for securing funding for art projects that aim to encourage vulnerable young people to participate in a variety of art forms; notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s CashBack for Communities scheme matched private sector funding for these projects pound for pound, and believes that such a diverse range of projects will engage disadvantaged young people from across Glasgow and help them find a voice and express difficult emotions through a variety of different art forms.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3367</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>World Cancer Day 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Wednesday 4 February is World Cancer Day 2009; acknowledges that the World Health Organisation predicts that 84 million people will die from cancer worldwide between 2005 and 2015; is aware that one of the deadliest cancers is lung cancer; recognises that the overwhelming majority of lung cancer deaths are smoking related; believes that the best way to reduce lung cancer mortality over the long term is to reduce the number of young people who become addicted to tobacco, and congratulates the work of ASH Scotland, a leading Scottish charity campaigning for effective tobacco control, and the work of many other charities and organisations working to prevent, treat and research cancer and those which provide palliative care and support both for sufferers and their families.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3349*#*</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Earth Hour 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports WWF&rsquo;s Earth Hour 2009, which aims to encourage millions of people worldwide and across Scotland to switch off their lights for an hour at 8.30 pm on Saturday 28 March 2009, to send a powerful global message that we care enough about climate change to take action and demonstrate widespread public support for an equitable, binding and scientifically credible global deal on climate change and, in Scotland, strong Scottish climate change legislation; considers that 2009 is a critical year for action on climate change with a new global deal to be agreed in Copenhagen in December; acknowledges the opportunity for Scotland to take a global lead with the most progressive legislation in the world through a strong Climate Change (Scotland) Bill; recognises that the global deal must address the historical responsibility of the United Kingdom and other developed countries, as major contributors to climate change; commends local government in Edinburgh alongside the many individuals who are early signatories to support WWF&rsquo;s Earth Hour in Scotland, and further considers that the Scottish and UK governments are in an ideal position to take a proactive, progressive and leading role throughout the 2009 negotiations.</p>
