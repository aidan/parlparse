<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5008</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Coastal and Marine National Parks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to manage Scotland&rsquo;s coastline and seas in a sustainable way; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s public consultation on proposals to establish Scotland&rsquo;s first Coastal and Marine National Park, and notes that the Executive will take account of the views expressed in response to the consultation before taking decisions on how to progress the proposals.</p>
<p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5007</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Support for Traditional Farming</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the replacement of traditional farming methods with intensive farming initiatives with devastating impacts on both the environment and the local community; notes that in many areas in the developing world farming communities have followed low-impact traditional farming practices successfully for many years; further notes that traditional methods, including mixed cropping, provide a nutritionally diverse diet to the local community and greater resilience to pests and local weather conditions; notes with concern, however, that in many countries traditional farming methods are under threat from intensive farming methods with their emphasis on high yields, the use of agri-chemicals, high-yielding hybrids, mechanisation and monocultures, which are detrimental to both the environment and local communities, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do all it can to encourage traditional farming methods, both at home and abroad, and to seek to aid farmers in the developing world in their attempts to resist changes to their faming methods and allow them to keep control of their farming and their communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5006</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Clydesdale Bank&rsquo;s Sponsorship of the Scottish Premier League</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Clydesdale Bank on its sponsorship of the Scottish Premier League beginning in July 2007, which represents a total investment of &pound;8 million over four years with additional investments to extend the value of the sponsorship to staff, customers and communities, helping to provide a solid foundation for the league for the next four years and contributing to the potential for success by Scottish footballers, their clubs, the national team and the sport in general.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5005</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Climate Change and Road Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes growing public and parliamentary recognition of the threat posed by climate change; notes that cuts in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions of 60% to 90% are necessary to stabilise climate change within a generation; notes that transport, excluding aviation, accounts for 19% of Scotland&rsquo;s climate change emissions, over 97% of which comes from road transport, and that road traffic is predicted to grow a further 27% by 2021; recognises that without reducing traffic levels it will be impossible to reduce Scottish greenhouse gas emissions to a level consistent with the need to address climate change; further recognises the need for urgent political action within the next four years to achieve year-on-year reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to set year-on-year overall greenhouse gas reduction targets and interim targets to reduce road traffic levels.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5004</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Drug Treatments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the recent announcement by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) that it has rejected all appeals and that drugs to treat Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease will in future only be available on the NHS to people with moderate Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; recognises that this means that people with mild Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease will no longer be eligible for treatment; notes that the current cost of the treatments is less than 0.3% of the total NHS Scotland drugs budget; is aware, however, that these treatments have been assessed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network as clinically effective at all stages of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; notes that memantine, currently widely prescribed across Europe and the United States of America for the treatment of severe Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, is also not being recommended for use; acknowledges that the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Royal College of General Practitioners also believe that these drugs are effective treatments in improving quality of life for people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; is concerned that NICE&rsquo;s appraisal focused solely on statistical, clinical and cost-effectiveness information and did not take into account the wider positive impact that these drugs can have on the lives of people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and their families, including maintaining independence for longer and alleviating the impact of the disease on carers&rsquo; own health and quality of life; notes that NICE&rsquo;s decision applies in England and Wales and takes effect on 22 November 2006; is aware that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) will publish its comment on the guidance on that date, which will then set the rules for NHS boards in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to listen to the views of patients, carers and clinicians alike, as well as any guidance from NHS QIS, and consider adopting a different position in Scotland to allow people at all stages of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease to continue receiving the medication that their GP or consultant recommends.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5003</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1 be completed by 12 January 2007.</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5000</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees under Rule 11.2.4 of Standing Orders that Decision Time on Thursday 2 November 2006 shall begin at 5.30 pm.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4999</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Young People and Families</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that children and young people are shaped by their relationships and experiences at home, in their schools and communities, by the physical space they find themselves in and by their economic circumstances; understands the absolute importance of these factors at the centre of healthy development; acknowledges that families and young people need support from time to time and that communities, public services, local authorities and the Scottish Executive share a responsibility to meet this need; regrets, however, that public debate in Scotland has increasingly reduced children and young people to simplistic stereotypes, either as innocents to be protected or as problems to be contained; in particular regrets that the tone of debate on antisocial behaviour has distracted attention and resources from the need to address the wider issues in young people&rsquo;s lives; believes that where problems such as youth disorder have arisen local communities are best placed to decide on the appropriate response; therefore rejects the idea of forcing local authorities to use specific antisocial behaviour measures against their better judgement, and calls on the Executive to develop a comprehensive strategy for supporting families and young people.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4998</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Donation Box for the Homeless Initiative in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the initiative in Aberdeen to install donation boxes for the homeless in the city centre and, in particular, commends the work of Aberdeen Cyrenians in the city; encourages citizens to favour this form of donation above giving money directly to homeless people, and regrets that Aberdeen City Council has yet to submit evidence to the Scottish Executive in support of a bye-law prohibiting street-begging.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4997</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Gretna Football Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Gretna Football Club on its continued success, both on the field and in its work in community-based projects with young people all over south-west Scotland and beyond; notes that the club has fulfilled a crucial and important role in providing a range of services to the community, free of charge, which include school visits, health visits, access for rural schools, festivals, work experience, youth club visits, environmental projects, a girls&rsquo; and women&rsquo;s project, a disability programme and an education programme, and that it has worked closely with the Dumfries-based First Base drugs group in delivering crucial advice to children and young people; notes that the recent decision by Dumfries and Galloway Council to grant planning permission to build two new 3,000 seat stands at its Raydale Stadium would help facilitate Gretna&rsquo;s entry into the Scottish Premier League if it is successful in securing the Scottish First Division title, and recognises that this would represent a tremendous and unique achievement for a small team from the south of Scotland which has prided itself on being a local community-based football club.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4996</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Closure of Scottish Gas Rebate Scheme for Vulnerable Senior Citizens and Others</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that Scottish Gas closed its commendable rebate scheme for vulnerable senior citizens and others on Friday 20 October 2006 due to 300,000 places being allocated under the scheme; notes that the scheme made up to &pound;90 available as a rebate on winter fuel bills, and deplores the fact that this ill-considered act will put added pressure on many pensioner households and exacerbate the situation with regard to winter-related deaths, because cold kills.</p>
<p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4995</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Living Planet Report 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes WWF&rsquo;s statement on the state of the natural world, <em>The Living Planet Report 2006, </em>which reveals that Scotland ranks 15th in the global league of ecological footprints, meaning that Scots are consuming resources at three times the rate that the planet can renew them, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to make sustainable development its top priority.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4994</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Euan Robson be appointed to replace Mr Jamie Stone on the Subordinate Legislation Committee.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4993</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mr Jamie Stone be appointed to replace Euan Robson on the Communities Committee.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4992</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4991</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Female Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that women in sub-Saharan Africa are more than 1.5 times as likely as men to contract HIV and that millions of women in Africa have difficulty understanding practical health information; further notes that more than 10,000 girls per day will get married before they turn 15 and that 60% of the 110 million children out of school are girls; notes that one in three women and girls in the developing world live on less than $2 per day; recognises that educated girls and women are less vulnerable to HIV infection, human trafficking and other forms of exploitation and are more likely to marry later, raise fewer children who are in turn more likely to go to school, and make important contributions to family income; further recognises the role that girls&rsquo; and women&rsquo;s education plays in reducing risk of infection and exploitation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that female education is raised at the highest levels of talks with leaders in sub-Saharan countries.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4990</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Use of Phosphorous Shells by Israel in Southern Lebanon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament utterly condemns the use of phosphorous shells by Israel in its recent campaign against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon; notes that Israel has justified its use of phosphorous shells as not contravening international norms; believes that use of such weapons in civilian areas of southern Lebanon is not in line with international norms and is, in fact, a clear breach of the Geneva Convention, thereby making Israel complicit in war crimes, and calls on the UK Government to use its best efforts to prevent all further supply of weapons and military equipment to Israel.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4989</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Link Between Racist Comments and Racially Motivated Attacks on Muslims</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament utterly condemns the racist attacks on Muslim citizens which are increasing both in Scotland and south of the border; further condemns the attacks on four worshippers at Eccles Mosque in Salford and on Imam Mohammed Shamsuddin at his mosque in Hillhead, Glasgow; believes that such attacks are a direct consequence of anti-Muslim hysteria whipped up by elements of the press and headline-seeking politicians, and calls on all those in public life to stop giving comfort and encouragement to racist thugs.</p>
