          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>S1M-1548</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie 
            McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Fisheries</strong>—That the Parliament notes the failure 
            of the Scottish Executive to take the lead in producing an appropriate 
            cod recovery plan for presentation as a United Kingdom submission 
            to the European Commission; believes that this failure has led to 
            European proposals for the North Sea which would seriously disadvantage 
            the Scottish fishing fleet; notes that the plan, unless altered, will 
            cause tremendous economic damage to Scotland’s fishing communities, 
            and calls for an alternative plan, devised in co-operation with the 
            Scottish fishing industry, to be promoted immediately, which will 
            lead to the revival of fish stocks and ensure a long-term future for 
            Scotland’s fishing industry. </font></p>

            to end and insert &quot;that the Scottish Executive, as part of the

            plan with the European Commission, is aiming to secure the best possible 
            deal for Scottish fishermen whilst ensuring a sustainable fishing 
            industry, and is fully involving the industry in these discussions.

            other European Member States provide generous financial support for 
            their fishing industries, Scotland’s industry receives minimal support, 
            and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to announce an appropriate 
            level of new investment in the industry given that such additional 
            support for our fishing communities in their hour of need will ensure 
            that they continue to make an enormous contribution to Scotland.&quot;

            of the ports of Stranraer and Cairnryan and the A75 corridor, in linking 
            Northern Ireland and Scotland with the rest of the United Kingdom 
            and the Republic of Ireland and in developing priority Trans-European 
            Network links; applauds the efforts of Dumfries and Galloway Council 
            and the North Channel Partnership to highlight the strategic importance 
            of the corridor as well as its economic importance to South West Scotland; 
            notes the concern of the Council and the Partnership that the Executive’s 
            current proposals for the A75 will neither ensure improvements to 
            the standards required for a Trans-European Networks road link, nor 
            deliver agreed improvements within a timescale which would allow Stranraer 
            and Cairnryan to compete effectively with the A55-Holyhead corridor, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive, in recognition of the strategic 
            importance of the A75 corridor, to work with all relevant partners 
            to reassess the A75 Route Action Plan proposals, with a view to promoting 
            a more comprehensive upgrading of the route and bringing forward firm 
            funding proposals. </font></p>
