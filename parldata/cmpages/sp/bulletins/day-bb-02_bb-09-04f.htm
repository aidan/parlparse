          <p><strong>*S1M-3351</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Throughcare and 
            Aftercare of Looked After Children</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            that young people leaving care need effective support to make a successful 
            transition to independent, adult living; welcomes publication of the 
            report by the Throughcare and Aftercare Working Group and the Executive's 
            intention to consult on its recommendations, and believes that the 
            policy initiatives led by the Executive will close the opportunity 
            gap for these young people and lead to real improvements in their 
            lives.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Nicol Stephen<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3350</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran: Scottish

            Executive for its Fuel Poverty Statement and its pledge to work in 
            partnership with Her Majesty's Government at Westminster and a range 
            of organisations; welcomes the milestones for achieving its overall 
            objective to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that people 
            are not living in fuel poverty by November 2016; recognises the substantial 
            investment that is being made in the Central Heating Programme and 
            the Warm Deal and in improving Scotland's housing stock, and further 
            recognises that the Statement affirms the Executive's commitment to 
            tackling fuel poverty and meeting its objective.</p>

            the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) 
            Bill, agrees to any increase in the sums payable out of the Scottish

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3348</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Opposition to

            of Iraq by USA forces and calls on the Prime Minister to try to dissuade 
            President Bush from such action, which would do incalculable damage 
            to the cause of peace in the Middle East and would almost certainly 
            destroy the lives of many innocent Iraqi people who are victims of 
            the oppressive regime of Saddam Hussein.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3347#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler: Iraq</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that a war against Iraq would result in an 
            enormous loss of innocent lives and could provoke a wider war in the 
            Middle East; is of the view that public opinion, both at home and 
            abroad, is overwhelmingly against such a war, and believes that the 
            Scottish Executive should make representations to the Prime Minister 
            to urge him to dissociate himself and Her Majesty's Government from 
            military action against Iraq, which is not sanctioned by the United 
            Nations Security Council. </p>

          <p><strong>*S1M-3343</strong> <strong> Elaine Smith: Abolition of the 
            Record of Needs System</strong>-That the Parliament notes the genuine 
            fears of parents and organisations over the proposed abolition of 
            the Record of Needs system for children with special educational needs; 
            expresses concern that the alternative proposal of a &quot;Co-ordinated

            &quot;Co-ordinated Support Plan&quot; will result in a reduction of 
            legal rights for children and their parents; further expresses concern 
            that local authorities are not required to carry out a fully comprehensive 
            series of assessments and that &quot;Co-ordinated Support Plans&quot; 
            can only be reviewed every three years, and proposes that consideration

          <p><strong>*S1M-3342</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: The Gaming

          <p><strong>*S1M-3340#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Unauthorised Transfer

            who are erroneously transferred from their chosen energy supplier 
            without their consent; recognises the distress and financial detriment 
            this can cause; welcomes energywatch's Stop Now campaign, aimed at 
            introducing solutions to this problem; further welcomes the action 
            already taken by the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government 
            on this matter, and believes that it would be beneficial to consumers 
            if a system is introduced which protects consumers from being transferred 
            without their prior knowledge and explicit consent and that individuals 
            affected by erroneous transfers should receive compensation from the 
            energy supplier.</p>

            to Mr Billy Connolly for his magnificent effort in raising funds for

            free to play the SECC on three successive nights to packed audiences 
            and how his gesture raised not only funds but also the hearts of people 
            in Glasgow left with no possessions after devastating flooding, and 
            salutes this international star as a true son of Glasgow, who returned

            Scotland's citizens to have access to a clean and safe water supply 
            to ensure that public health is not compromised; requests the Transport 
            and the Environment Committee to initiate an inquiry into the extent 
            of contamination of water supplies from cryptosporidium, trihalomethanes 
            and lead, or other sources of contamination, and into whether the 
            investment programme currently planned by Scottish water is adequate 
            to ensure these clean and safe supplies and to restore public confidence 
            in the water that people drink and use; further requests the Transport 
            and the Environment Committee to consider whether the current regulatory 
            regime with separate offices for the Water Commissioner and the Water 
            Regulator acts in the best interests of the consumer; believes that 
            legislation concerning the supply of water contaminated by cryptosporidium 
            should be introduced bringing the level of protection afforded to 
            consumers in Scotland to at least the level in England, and has serious 
            reservations about the inept handling of the recent cryptosporidium 
            outbreak in Glasgow by the Minister for Environment and Rural Development 
            and Scottish Water, in particular the failure to fully implement the 
            findings of the report produced by the Outbreak Control Team in November 
            2001 and to adequately and accurately inform the public about the

            in terms of monitoring, reporting and assessment of water quality, 
            and regrets the Executive's handling, through Scottish Water, of Scotland's
