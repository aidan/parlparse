<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3745</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Renfrewshire Education Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views with serious concern the decision taken by Renfrewshire Council to make savings in its educational budget for 2009-10 of some &pound;2.5 million and that as part of the reduction it plans to cut music tuition from weekly to once per fortnight; congratulates those pupils who expressed their deep anger over this decision by protesting outside Paisley Town Hall before the annual Renfrewshire schools spring concert; further notes with concern that Renfrewshire has already suffered the sharpest proportionate reduction in teacher numbers in Scotland; deplores the council&rsquo;s stated objective of eliminating a further 81 educational posts; believes that it is reprehensible that teachers are afraid to voice their concerns because of fear of disciplinary measures, and calls on Renfrewshire Council to withdraw the damaging education cuts to music tuition in order to encourage and support those pupils who wish to study music after school.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3744</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Post Bank</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposal for a new post bank to be run as part of the post office network that was launched on Tuesday 17 March 2009 by a coalition of trade unions, businesses, pensioner and pressure groups and charities; notes that the proposed model would strengthen the role of the post office network making it more viable, creating new job opportunities and securing its role for the future; further notes that it would mark a return to the form of relationship banking abandoned by our biggest banks and ensure a stable source of finance in the heart of communities that could provide financial services to three million people still not using banks, including the most disadvantaged people, pensioners, people who live in very remote rural areas and the many small businesses that are looking for alternative sources of finance, of which two out of five would consider banking with a post bank; recognises that the post office network is a unique national resource on which communities, businesses and individuals depend, and believes that setting up a post bank provides a unique opportunity to answer both concerns around secure and equitable finance and the future of the post office network.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3743</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Cuban Women on Tour</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Carolina Amador Perez, international relations officer of the federation of Cuban women, the FMC, and Gilda Chac&oacute;n Bravo, of the international department of Cuba&rsquo;s trade union congress, the CTC, who are visiting Scotland from 12 March to 4 April 2009 as part of a tour of the United Kingdom; is pleased that, as Cuba celebrates 50 years of its revolution, this tour offers the opportunity to discuss what this has meant for women in that country; notes that the FMC is one of the largest women&rsquo;s organisations in the world, with more than three million members aged 14 and above; congratulates the FMC on its work, which has contributed to the fact that women now make up 42% of elected parliamentary positions in Cuba, the third largest representation of women in any parliament in the world, and congratulates women of the CTC who have leading roles in Cuba&rsquo;s trade union movement.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3742</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Maryhill Housing Association and the Lintel Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Maryhill Housing Association&rsquo;s team, Vamos Maryhill, on its victory in the annual charity tennis event for the Lintel Trust; commends both Maryhill Housing Association and the Lintel Trust for the excellent work they do in helping people in housing need; acknowledges the contribution of the other teams that took part in the successful event, raising &pound;1,500 for the Lintel Trust, and recognises that this victory for Maryhill Housing Association proves that its team excels across the range of its endeavours.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3741&diams; </strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Inadequate Infertility Treatment in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that couples seeking fertility treatment in the NHS have to wait for 20 months in Glasgow, 13 months in Lanarkshire, 13 months in Ayrshire and Arran, 15 months in Dumfries and Galloway, three years in Lothian, six months for Lothian self-funding, up to 18 months in Grampian, up to 14 months in Highland, 12 months in Tayside, up to two years in Fife and up to two years in Forth Valley and that Orkney decides on a case-by-case basis; is pleased to learn that Shetland has no waiting restrictions; is extremely disturbed to note that Fife NHS board ranks among the worst providers of the service in Scotland in that each frozen embryo is counted as a cycle, when other NHS boards require fresh and frozen embryo(s) to count as a cycle and that Fife NHS board only provides two cycles whereas other NHS boards provide three, thereby effectively giving Fife couples a third of the opportunity for this treatment that some other couples in Scotland have; expresses particular concerned that when a woman is in a relationship with a partner who has a child from a previous relationship that she is denied access to any form of NHS provision in this area of specialism, and considers that NHS Lothian provides an example in increasing the age at which it accepts prospective fertility treatment candidates in consideration of the fact that many couples will not know that they need fertility treatment until their late 30s and are subsequently restricted by the unacceptable waiting times.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3740</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>North Glasgow Housing Association Completes 900th New Build Home</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the completion of the 65-house development at Mireton Street in Possilpark; recognises the important contribution that this development makes to the regeneration of Possilpark; notes that this development brings the total number of houses built by North Glasgow Housing Association to 900, and congratulates the management committee, staff and tenants on reaching this milestone.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3739</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>No Support for Local Businesses, Greener Government</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern that the Scottish Government, in expanding the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s (COPFS) bike-to-work scheme, has chosen to enrich only Halfords, a major multi-national company, rather than permitting the employees of COPFS to opt to purchase and support a local and small business of their choice, such as Sandy Wallace Cycles in Inverkeithing, and expresses serious disappointment that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s words on policy are not reflected by actions on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3738</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Infobase North Lanarkshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent launch of Infobase North Lanarkshire (INL), a new comprehensive information resource for and about the voluntary sector in North Lanarkshire; notes that the resource will be managed by CVS North Lanarkshire and funded by North Lanarkshire Partnership and NHS Lanarkshire; further notes that INL will provide a one-stop-shop for accurate and up-to-date information on North Lanarkshire&rsquo;s voluntary and community organisations, and believes that INL will be a real asset to partnership working and an invaluable resource for everyone working and living in North Lanarkshire.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3732</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Bike Belles</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Bike Belles initiative, recently lauched by Sustrans, that seeks to persuade more women to take up cycling; notes that less than one in 10 women cycle more than once a month and that women in Scotland are among the least likely in the United Kingdom to cycle; further notes the many health benefits that cycling brings at comparatively low cost compared with many other methods of staying in shape, and therefore encourages more women to visit the Bike Belles website to see whether cycling could be right for them.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3727.1</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3727) in the name of Sarah Boyack, insert at end &quot;and considers that, to maximise the contribution that forestry can make to addressing climate change challenges, the Scottish Government should work with all forestry interests, with saw mills and the building and construction industries towards the long-term aim of deploying timber frame and massive timber construction techniques as standard practice where possible in future building in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3727.2</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3727) in the name of Sarah Boyack, insert at end &quot;and considers that all forestry proposals in future must be part of an integrated land-use strategy.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3726.2</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Police Numbers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3726) in the name of Richard Baker, insert at end &quot;; notes the Police Force Projection Study carried out by the Scottish Government estimating that police officer numbers are likely to be between 17,275 and 17,484 by 31 March 2011; notes that the SNP&rsquo;s attempt to alter its commitment to the delivery of the equivalent of 1,000 officers would not have achieved this result; welcomes the fact that the Scottish Government was forced by opposition parties and public opinion to firm up its commitment; regrets the Scottish Government&rsquo;s repeated efforts to confuse and obfuscate the figures, noting that, as recently as 3 March 2009, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice cast further doubt on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s intention and ability to achieve the target, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland to retain skills and expertise in the police force through appropriate workforce planning and ensure that police officers are working effectively and visibly in Scotland&rsquo;s local communities.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3699 *#*</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that retained firefighters provide an invaluable service to communities across Scotland, particularly those in remote and rural areas, such as the north east and Highlands and Islands; believes that setting a 48-hour maximum to the working week as currently proposed in relation to retained firefighters could greatly reduce the hours for which they would be available for duty, to the detriment of fire services in many remote and rural communities; recognises the concerns raised by the Retained Firefighters Union in relation to the recent European Parliament vote to end the UK opt-out to the EU working time directive; agrees with the STUC and Fire Brigades Union that, as the issue is now subject to negotiations at European level, there is no immediate threat to fire provision, and hopes that the mature and responsible joint efforts by the Scottish and UK governments will ensure that any future changes to the EU working time directive ensure the flexibility required to allow the continuation of retained firefighters and the protection of workers&rsquo; rights.</p>
