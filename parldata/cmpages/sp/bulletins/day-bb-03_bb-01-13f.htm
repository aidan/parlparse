          <p><strong>*S1M-3761</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Firefighters' 
            Strike</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the insulting offer to 
            the firefighters of 4% funded by the loss of 4,500 jobs and 150 fire 
            stations; believes that this offer shows that the Parliament was correct 
            when it rejected the Scottish Executive's attempt to amend the Fire 
            Services Act 1947 to allow the speedy closure of fire stations, and 
            calls on the Executive to call on Her Majesty's Government to fund 
            fully local authorities to enable them to settle the firefighters' 
            just claim.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3760</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: The Current International 
            Situation</strong>-That the Parliament endorses United Nations Security 
            Council Resolution 1441 on the basis that it provides a mandate for 
            weapons inspection in Iraq; welcomes the legal opinion of Matrix Chambers 
            on behalf of CND which concluded that Resolution 1441 does not provide 
            an authorisation for military action in Iraq and that any such use 
            of force would breach international law; believes that UN weapons 
            inspectors must be afforded total freedom of access in Iraq and to 
            all evidence in the possession of other states, together with sufficient 
            time in order to produce a comprehensive report for the consideration 
            of the Security Council on the state of Iraqi compliance with the 
            resolution; believes that no commitment of UK forces should be made 
            without a specific mandate for military action in Iraq in the form 
            of a further Security Council resolution based on clear, published 
            and compelling evidence provided by the UN inspectorate of a material 
            breach of Resolution 1441, and expresses its deep and serious concern 
            that Her Majesty's Government is currently pursuing an inevitable 
            path to war.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3759#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Dealing with 
            Young Offenders</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the Audit 
            Scotland report, <em>Dealing with offending by young people</em>, makes 
            38 recommendations for action in dealing with young people who offend; 
            in particular, notes the report's statements that (a) the system for 
            dealing with young people is slow, taking on average five and a half 
            months for a child to reach a children's hearing and around eight 
            months to get a court decision on a young person, (b) young people 
            are dealt with unevenly across Scotland, (c) large numbers of young 
            people, 2,300 or 16% of those convicted, are imprisoned and that 60% 
            of those re-offend within two years of release, (d) more money, around 
            60% of the total spending on youth justice, is spent on prosecuting 
            and reaching decisions about young offenders than on services to tackle 
            offending behaviour, (e) there is a chronic shortage of social workers 
            in children's services and 13% of posts for children's services social 
            workers were vacant and (f) information about offending and about 
            the quality of services is inadequate, and considers this thorough 
            report a damning indictment of the Scottish Executive's youth crime 
            policies and that after nearly four years in office, these policies 
            have failed Scotland's young, their parents, their communities and 
            Scotland at large.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3758#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Glasgow to 
            Barra Air Link Public Service Obligation</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the decision to announce a one year contract for 
            the Glasgow to Barra air link; recognises that such contracts are 
            normally awarded for the three years of a public service obligation 
            (PSO) order; recognises the unanimous view of the community that any 
            loss of the direct air link would result in damage to the local economy 
            and tourism and create hardship for those attending hospital and receiving 
            life-saving treatment in Glasgow and beyond; notes that the Deputy 
            Minister for Transport, Lewis Macdonald MSP, attended a meeting on 
            the island of Barra and assured islanders that their genuine concerns 
            would be taken seriously and fed into the Scottish Executive review; 
            further recognises that this proposal is undermining confidence in 
            the long-term viability of the air service, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should ensure that the review is completed on or 
            before the end of March.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3757</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran: Building (Scotland) 
            Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the Building (Scotland) 
            Bill be passed.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3756#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: UNICEF Report, The 
            State of the World's Children 2003</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the publication of the report <em>The State of the World's Children 
            2003</em>; commends UNICEF's commitment to monitoring children's rights 
            and development internationally and congratulates it for its contribution 
            for achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals: is 
            concerned that the report shows that children's participation in society 
            is largely undeveloped and that millions of children and young people 
            have doubts about the usefulness of voting as a method of improving 
            their lives and often do not see government leaders as role models; 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should take all possible action 
            to assist Her Majesty's Government in achieving the Millennium Development 
            Goals, and supports the creation of a protective environment to allow 
            children world-wide to grow up free from poverty, abuse, neglect and 
            exploitation.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3754 Bristow Muldoon on behalf of the Transport and the 
            Environment Committee: Report on Inquiry into the Rail Industry in 
            Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 15th Report 2002 of 
            the Transport and Environment Committee, <em>Report on Inquiry into 
            the Rail Industry in Scotland</em> (SP Paper 674). </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3753#</strong> <strong>Gordon Jackson: Regeneration of 
            the Clyde</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance to 
            Scotland of efforts to regenerate the Clyde; considers that the Scottish 
            Executive and Scottish Enterprise should establish and resource a 
            development framework for the Clyde which encourages joined-up thinking 
            and action; further considers that the respective councils, enterprise 
            companies, regeneration agencies and private developers should work 
            co-operatively in reclaiming derelict land, ensuring adequate flood 
            protection and improving the transport infrastructure, and believes 
            that ministers should make the regeneration of the Clyde one of the 
            top economic, environmental and social justice priorities for Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3752</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Dumping of Salmon</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the recent decision of the European 
            Commission to allow the EU/Norway agreement on the minimum import 
            price of salmon to lapse and to terminate its investigation of the 
            anti-dumping complaints against salmon farmers in Chile and the Faeroe 
            Islands without imposing any anti-dumping measures; condemns the Commission 
            for making the announcement over the Christmas and New Year holiday 
            period, effectively leaving Scottish salmon farmers less than a week 
            to make a detailed submission in response to its disclosure document; 
            recognises the importance of the salmon farming industry to Scotland, 
            particularly in the Highlands and Islands, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to support calls for an extension of the deadline for responses 
            to the Commission's disclosure document and to ensure that the case 
            put to the Commission by the EU Salmon Producers Group is given full 
            and proper consideration.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone, John Farquhar Munro, Robin Harper</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3751#</strong> <strong>George Lyon: Rural Communities 
            and Renewable Energy</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the ambitious 
            targets set by the Scottish Executive for renewable energy generation; 
            recognises the potential job benefits to be gained from a Scottish 
            manufacturing support base for renewable energy; further recognises 
            the crucial importance of communities benefiting from wind farms and 
            other renewable energy developments in their areas;<font color="#808000"> 
            </font>notes the growing<font color="#0000ff"> </font>number of wind 
            farm planning applications across rural Scotland; notes with concern 
            the hostile reception such applications have received from members 
            of the local community, who perceive no benefit to the community; 
            further notes that benefits can be delivered through community ownership, 
            rental income, reduced electricity bills or other methods, and considers 
            that the Executive should ensure that the Scottish economy and affected 
            communities benefit from the expansion of renewable energy.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3750#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Ageism in the Labour 
            Market</strong>-That the Parliament believes that it is both absurd 
            and hypocritical to advocate the need for longer working lives when 
            the labour market is infected so heavily with ageism, meaning that 
            many individuals in their 40s and 50s are denied the opportunity to 
            engage in full-time, or even part-time, work or voluntary participation 
            in their local communities; further believes that measures must be 
            adopted in the public and private sectors to deal with this economic 
            and social problem, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            set a good example by ensuring that the civil service and public bodies 
            are free of the pernicious problem of ageism in personnel principles, 
            policies and practices.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3742</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe: Lord Jenkins of 
            Hillhead</strong>-That the Parliament notes with sadness the death 
            of the Rt Hon Lord Jenkins of Hillhead; recalls his political service 
            as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and President of the 
            European Commission; recognises that, in his fight for human rights 
            and against bigotry, racism, sexism, xenophobia and prejudice of all 
            kinds, Roy Jenkins was far ahead of his time; further notes, in particular, 
            his success as a liberal Home Secretary, in areas from prison reform 
            to the reform of laws about homosexuality; appreciates his tenure 
            as a distinguished representative of a Scottish constituency in Glasgow 
            Hillhead, and expresses gratitude for his life of outstanding public 
            service with a radical and reforming spirit.</p>

            industry; recognises that the Inverclyde economy has, in common with 
            the wider Scottish economy, already been affected by job losses at 
            companies such as NEC, Motorola and Compaq, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive and Scottish Enterprise to make every effort to respond 
            to this serious situation and minimise the impact of the announcement

            benefit; further notes the stark contrast between the obligations 
            placed on landlords in the social rented sector and landlords in the 
            private rented sector; believes that private sector landlords who 
            are in receipt of public funding should be expected to meet minimum 
            standards and procedures in the way that their properties are managed, 
            in order to protect the rights of private sector tenants and their 
            neighbours and to ensure probity in the distribution of public funds, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should address these serious 
            matters as a matter of priority.</p>
