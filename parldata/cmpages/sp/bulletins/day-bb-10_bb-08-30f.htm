<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at  <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6880 Jamie Hepburn: Vigil to highlight Freedom of Religion and Imprisonment of Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s in Iran</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its support to the organisers of a vigil, to be held in St Mungo Museum in Cathedral Square, Glasgow, on Saturday 28 August 2010 from 3 pm until 10 pm, to highlight freedom of religion in Iran and the plight of seven prominent Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s, who were this month sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by the Iranian authorities; agrees with the comments of Foreign Secretary William Hague that the sentencing is &quot;a shocking example of the Iranian state&rsquo;s continued discrimination against the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s&quot;; believes that people across Scotland should show their support for the vigil as a means of showing solidarity with the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community and their commitment to the right of freedom of religious expression, and joins Foreign Secretary William Hague&rsquo;s in calling on the Iranian authorities to consider any appeal against this sentencing of these seven individuals and to immediately cease discrimination against the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6879 Bill Kidd: The UK June 2010 Budget and Equality Assessments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern, following remarks by the Equality and Human Rights Commission that the UK Government must consider the effect of budget cuts on vulnerable groups and that &quot;Under equality legislation, the Treasury, like all public bodies, has a legal duty to pay &quot;due regard&quot; to equality and consider any disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups when making decisions, including decisions about the budget&quot;, at the apparent failure by the UK Government to carry out assessments of the effects of the June 2010 Budget on vulnerable groups and considers in particular that the severe cut-backs on disability living allowance, expressly to save money rather than based on the principle of fairness, would appear to fall disproportionably heavily on disabled people as a vulnerable group.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6872 Bill Kidd: UK Government Hits Poorest Hardest, New IFS Research</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that research by the Institute of Fiscal Studies has indicated that the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government&rsquo;s June 2010 UK Budget is regressive as it &quot;shows that, once all of the benefit cuts are considered, the tax and benefit changes announced in the emergency Budget are clearly regressive&quot; and that &quot;Low-income households of working age lose the most as a proportion of income from the tax and benefit reforms announced in the emergency Budget&quot;.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6871 Des McNulty: International Literacy Day 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes International Literacy Day 2010, which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday 8 September 2010; notes that it forms part of the UNESCO <em>Literacy Decade 2003-13</em>,which has the aim of raising awareness of the importance of literacy across the globe; further notes that the Scottish Survey of Adult Literacies (SSAL) 2009 showed that 73.3% of the Scottish working age population have a level of skills recognised internationally as appropriate for a contemporary society while 26.7% may face occasional challenges and constrained opportunities due to their literacy skills and that, within that group, 3.6% face serious challenges in their literacy practices; considers that this means the literacy level of a sizeable minority of people acts as a barrier that prevents them from making the most of their opportunities and believes that there are still far too many people who are excluded from full participation in activities as a result of the literacy challenges that they face; agrees with the Literacy Commission report published in December 2009 that Scotland should have a zero tolerance approach to illiteracy, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the forthcoming Literacy Action Plan takes forward all the main recommendations of the Literacy Commission.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6870 Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell: International Day of the Disappeared, 30 August 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the British Red Cross and the other organisations involved in tracing those people who are missing and in trying to restore family links across the world; recognises that every year people go missing as a result of conflicts and natural disasters and sombrely notes how enforced disappearances can arise through abduction or imprisonment; remembers those who are missing and the family and friends trying to trace their loved ones, and believes that on 30 August 2010, the International Day of the Disappeared, we should remember those who are missing and support the work in tracing them in any we can.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6867 John Scott: Potential Disadvantage for Scottish Egg Producers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that EU animal welfare legislation introducing a ban on the use of conventional cages for laying hens might not be enforced equally across the EU member states from 1 January 2012; believes that this will be disadvantageous to the Scottish and British egg industry, which has already incurred significant costs in meeting the requirements of the legislation by investing in enriched cages or non-cage systems of egg production; notes that the United Kingdom is already the largest free-range egg producer in the EU; further notes that eggs produced to a lower animal welfare standard are cheaper to produce and might be allowed access to Scottish and British markets post-2012, and is of the view that, once again, Scottish and UK farmers will be put at a competitive disadvantage by producing eggs to the highest EU-agreed animal welfare standards while farmers in other member states are unlikely to be able to meet the deadline and that they might be allowed additional time to phase-out the use of conventional cages post-2012.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-6866 Bill Wilson: Importance of FCO Human Rights Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is considering cutting the costs of its <em>Annual Human Rights Report</em>; applauds, however, the statement on its website that &quot;It is not in our character as a nation to have a foreign policy without a conscience or to repudiate our obligation to help those less fortunate&quot;, and calls on the FCO to cut costs only with regard to the physical format of the report and not its compass and rigour.</p>
