                        notes with concern and anger the crisis in the rail network

                        the control and legislative powers over the rail industry 
                        in Scotland remain primarily reserved matters for Her 
                        Majesty’s Government, and calls for all the powers over 
                        the rail industry in Scotland to be transferred to the 
                        Parliament, for the Scottish Executive to be given Scotland’s 
                        share of new investment in transport infrastructure and 
                        for a mechanism to be established so that Scotland’s interests
