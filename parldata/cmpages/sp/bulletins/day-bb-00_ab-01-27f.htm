    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-468</b> <strong>Hugh Henry: Nelson Mandela Tribute</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament welcomes the establishment of a web site to record tributes to Nelson Mandela
    and the contribution of the Prime Minister and other members of the UK Parliament to this
    celebration of the life, so far, of Nelson Mandela; asks that the First Minister should
    co-ordinate a similar tribute from the Scottish Parliament members to mark the unique and
    selfless contribution of Nelson Mandela to the civil and human rights movement, and calls
    upon the Scottish Executive to encourage schools and civic institutions across Scotland to
    participate in this project.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-467</b> <strong>Rhoda Grant: Scallops Fishing Industry</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with deep concern the plight of scallop fishermen and farmers faced
    with the current closures under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, and urges
    the Scottish Executive to implement a temporary regime of end product testing as a matter
    of urgency and to come forward with a regime of both monitoring and end product testing,
    along the lines of that proposed by the Association of Scottish Shellfish Growers, in
    order to ensure that the industry can continue to operate during periods of amnesic
    shellfish poisoning, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning and paralytic shellfish poisoning
    outbreaks and to protect the live scallop market when there are no outbreaks.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-466</b> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: Raising of the Solway Harvester by the
    Manx Parliament</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the Manx Government, the
    Tynwald and all other Isle of Man services on the speedy and efficient way in which they
    have dealt with the aftermath of the tragic loss of the Solway Harvester and commends the
    generosity of the Tynwald in its decision to fund the recovery of the vessel.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-465#</b> <strong>Scott Barrie: Positive Discipline of Children</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament believes that in a modern Scotland concerned with social justice for all
    there is no place for the concept of &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot; of children; that
    children should have the same protection under the law as adults from being hit; that a
    new, modern legislative framework would be the best basis from which to promote positive
    discipline; that such policies would keep more children safe, support families and assist
    in the development of a less violent, more caring society, and that failing to scrap the
    Victorian defence of &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot; and trying to define where a
    child can be hit, how a child can be hit and with what a child can be hit, is a recipe for
    confusion and fear for parents and fails children in the new millennium.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Irene McGugan<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-464</b> <strong>David Mundell: Necessity of Cross Border Study</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the geographic reality that some students in the South of
    Scotland have no option but to study in the North of England through either the
    practicality of transport links or a social need to stay at home and attend the university
    course available at the place most conveniently near to their home; recognises that the
    choice of the place of study for these students is not simply an academic choice but is
    one of practicality and necessity, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to produce
    proposals which ensure that those students in the South of Scotland who require to study
    in the North of England out of geographic or social necessity rather than academic choice
    can do so on the same financial basis as students resident in Scotland studying in
    Scotland.</p>

    &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;resolves that the principle of free access to
    higher education must be restored; calls upon the Scottish Executive to abolish tuition
    fees for all Scottish students at UK universities and opposes the proposals for a Scottish
    Graduate Endowment as tuition fees by another name, and demands the implementation in full
    of the other recommendations of the Independent Inquiry into Student Finance.&quot;<i><strong> </strong></i></p>

    &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets the failure of the Scottish
    Executive&#146;s proposals to deal effectively with the depth of student poverty
    highlighted in the Cubie Report and believes that only a free higher education system,
    funded by progressive income tax with no tuition fees either open or hidden, can address
    this problem, that student grants should be restored to the level recommended by the Cubie
    Report to reflect the cost of higher education of £6,000 a year and that students should
    be entitled to housing benefit and income support during vacations.&quot;</p>

    amendment to motion (S1M-461) in the name of Henry McLeish, leave out from
    &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;rejects the Scottish Executive&#146;s
    framework for its failure to abolish unconditionally tuition fees for all Scottish
    students and its introduction of a new tuition tax which together with the reduction in
    loan entitlement for a significant number of applicants puts many Scottish students in a
    worse position than before.&quot;<i><strong> </strong></i></p>
