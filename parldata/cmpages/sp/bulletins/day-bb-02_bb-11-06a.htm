greater local flexibility for schools in delivery of the National Priorities in 
Education; welcomes the contribution made by innovative projects in the Future

seems unable to take on board ideas which will make a real difference in the medium 
and long term such as the need for a substantial lowering in class sizes, particularly 
in the early years of primary, the simplification of the Scottish exam system, 
the review of 5-14 with the aim of creating more flexibility and less pressure, 
the building and development of a collective and collegiate view of school management 
as envisaged in the McCrone agreement (which should also involve parents and young 
people), and other major topics, but instead seeks to apply spin and hype to a 
First Minister&#146;s vision of education that is lacking in vision and depth 
and does not constructively address the main issue of providing the best education 
possible for every child in Scotland.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3536.3</STRONG>
