<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1448</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following revision to the programme of business for Thursday 6 March 2008&mdash;</p>
<p>after</p>
<p>Thursday 6 March 2008</p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p>insert</p>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Ministerial Statement: Redevelopment of the State Hospital</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1447</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Renfrewshire Recycling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the valuable contribution made by Renfrewshire Recycling to environmental improvement, helping poorer families and assisting the unemployed into work; notes that Renfrewshire Council commended the project for its work and that the council spent over &pound;20 million last year on recycling initiatives; further notes that &pound;500,000 per year would keep the project alive, and calls on the Scottish Executive and Renfrewshire Council to provide funds to enable the Wise Group to sustain this valuable project.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1446</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>General Education Department at Coatbridge College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposal to close the General Education Department at Coatbridge College; believes that this would be a retrograde step in the provision of further education to the communities served by the college, many of whom suffer from high levels of deprivation; further notes that redundancy packages have been offered to the staff despite assurances that a consultation period was underway, and believes that the whole proposal should be shelved immediately to allow proper consultation and debate, reflecting on the long-term impact of removing these crucial learning opportunities from the communities that the college serves.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1445</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>A Berry Good Solution for Scottish Public Health</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the parallels between diet-related public health problems in Scotland and those formerly prevalent in Finland; notes the practical and successful health initiatives put forward by the Finnish Government to support and encourage dietary changes, in particular the consumption of locally grown soft fruits; expresses support and encouragement for small businesses in this sector, such as Ella Drinks Ltd in Alloa; applauds the work of Berry Scotland in advocating these policies in Scotland but notes concerns existing at grassroots in the berry sector at other bodies in the industry having an excessively UK-wide focus that impairs the ability to promote their sector in the particular Scottish health context and that does not compare favourably with well-supported representative bodies in related sectors such as Quality Meat Scotland; acknowledges that the scale of enterprises in this sector means that solutions to this imbalance such as a levy-based trade organisation would almost certainly require central co-ordination and support; welcomes existing support for soft fruit businesses delivered through the Scottish Government&rsquo;s enterprise arms, and encourages the Scottish Government to build on this by entering a dialogue with the sector to establish how further critical support could also be delivered from a health standpoint so that the sector can be recognised for and release its potential to help address many of Scotland&rsquo;s underlying health problems.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1444&diams; </strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that 23 March 2008 marks the first anniversary of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s signing of the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings; notes that this convention is yet to be ratified in order to enshrine the rights of victims of trafficking in domestic law; further notes that there are substantial responsibilities for the Scottish Government under this convention, including the identification of trafficking victims in line with services to victims of trafficking, the investigation and prosecution of trafficking and the non-prosecution of crimes that trafficking victims have been coerced into; believes that a lead should be taken in the UK in the implementation of the parts of the convention for which it has responsibility, and considers that all measures should be taken to stop this modern-day form of slavery.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1443</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>MSP of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Malcolm Chisholm MSP on being named MSP of the Year, following a ballot of its member organisations by the Scottish Association on Mental Health, and continues to support voluntary sector organisations who do so much to promote the issues of mental health, particularly in areas of disadvantage, such as the Positive Mental Attitudes Group which has contributed significantly to the development of local services in the east end of Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1442</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Cuts in Highland Council Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the planned cuts in vital council and voluntary sector services being made by Highland Council as a result of the SNP government&rsquo;s priorities for spending; notes that these cuts are taking place at a time when the Scottish Government has the largest budget for public services since devolution and twice that which Donald Dewar had only a few short years ago; further notes in particular that Highland Council plans to build up financial reserves while cutting services and shedding jobs; questions whether the single outcome agreement with Highland Council to deliver SNP manifesto commitments will now do so, in particular with regard to class-size reductions, and urges the SNP government and SNP/Independent-led Highland Council to reverse the planned cuts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1441</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>West Dunbartonshire Citizen of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Anna Hemphill and Thomas Nimmo for their awards as citizens of the year 2008 for Dumbarton and the Vale of Leven; applauds their tireless work for communities and organisations in the area; notes that Mr Nimmo has been a key member of the West Dunbartonshire Care Forum and a founding member of both the Levenvale Older People&rsquo;s Welfare Association and the Vale of Leven Remembrance Day Association; further notes that Ms Hemphill has been a volunteer for the Citizens Advice Bureau for 30 years and in a professional capacity has helped hundreds of unemployed people get back into employment through ONTO Work in Alexandria, and celebrates the efforts of all our local heroes who work instinctually on behalf of our communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1440</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>The Whole of the UK Should Celebrate the Bravery of Scots</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the George Medal and George Cross were both introduced in 1940 by King George VI to recognise the bravery of civilians during the Second World War; also acknowledges that the George Medal carries the head of King George IV on one side and the name of the awardee on the other; urges SNP MSPs to acknowledge that there are three medals for civilian bravery and gallantry and encourages these MSPs to note the difference between them; believes that attempts by nationalist MSPs to introduce a St Andrew&rsquo;s Medal are an insult to a whole generation of Scots who fought and died to protect the United Kingdom; believes that the sole intention of Christine Grahame&rsquo;s motion, S3M-1420, is to peddle narrow nationalism; remembers that one of the most recent medals for gallantry awarded to a Scot was to John Smeaton, and believes the whole of the United Kingdom is grateful to him for the unflinching bravery and selflessness that he demonstrated during the attacks on Glasgow Airport.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1439</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Handle With Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes <em>Handle With Care: A report on the moving and handling of children and young people with disabilities</em>, laid before the Parliament by Scotland&rsquo;s Commissioner for Children and Young People; recognises that moving and handling issues can cause significant disruption to the lives of children and young people and their families; notes that poor practice may result in breaches of children&rsquo;s rights, be detrimental to their welfare and limit their enjoyment of life, while good practice contributes to children&rsquo;s physical and emotional welfare, helping to maximise their mobility and independence; congratulates the young people who worked with the commissioner on the report for their courage in helping to bring this important issue to the attention of the Parliament, and urges central and local government and all service providers to note the findings of the report and explore how they can contribute to the wellbeing of children and young people with disabilities by considering how they can take forward the recommendations set out in the report.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1438</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Derogatory Remarks about Lockerbie and Sir Tom Hunter</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns remarks made by Christopher Harvie MSP at the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee on 20 February 2008 regarding the town of Lockerbie (<em>Official Report</em>, c. 460-461); condemns also his comments about young people and about one of Scotland&rsquo;s most successful entrepreneurs, Sir Tom Hunter; believes that Sir Tom is a good role model for young people and applauds his initiatives to address the effects of disadvantage on young people; notes that the problems of empty properties in Lockerbie long precede the presence of Tesco in the town; believes that further investment by both the public and private sector is required to regenerate town centres such as Lockerbie, and believes that the Scottish Government should consider introducing specific government funding directed towards addressing the problems of Scotland&rsquo;s town centres.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1437</strong> <strong>Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>Tackling Sectarianism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils of Croftfoot Primary School and St Mirin&rsquo;s Primary School, Glasgow, on their inspirational joint work to combat sectarianism, which has been ongoing for three years and which has been recognised by the devolved governments of Scotland and Northern Ireland and by the government of the Irish Republic.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1434.1</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Improving Accountability</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1434) in the name of Jackie Baillie, insert at end &quot;and further believes that the best way of ensuring independent oversight is for the Parliament to appoint a person independent of government to investigate alleged breaches of the Scottish Ministerial Code.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1434.2</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Improving Accountability</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1434) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from &quot;oversight of the Scottish Ministerial code&quot; to end and insert &quot;authority to direct ministers in the appropriate arrangements for ensuring that their conduct as ministers is in accordance with the Scottish Ministerial Code to avoid conflict or potential conflict of interest, and to oversee its administration, and to bring forward a statement to the Parliament on this when the review is concluded.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1432.1</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Children</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1432) in the name of Paul Martin, leave out from &quot;the crucial role&quot; to end and insert &quot;that appropriate utilisation of DNA samples and fingerprints can play an important role in identifying offenders but that it is vital to strike the right balance between prosecuting criminals and protecting the innocent and notes the review that the Scottish Government has commissioned from Professor James Fraser; recognises the extensive powers already available to the police in monitoring sex offenders and ensuring public safety, and notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s liaison with the Home Office as disclosure pilots progress in four English police areas and the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposal to monitor the outcomes of these pilots to determine what lessons there might be for Scotland, and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposal to write to the Convener of the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Justice Committee to report progress on each of the 33 recommendations made by the Justice 2 Sub-committee report J2SC/S2/06/R1.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1367.1</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1367) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, insert at end &quot;and, in so doing, notes that the Scottish Government is no longer pledged to abolish graduate loan debt and acknowledges also the inadequate increase in the Young Students&rsquo; Bursary and, as the Scottish Government has a responsibility to develop a system of student funding to provide sufficient financial support to students while they study, believes that an independent commission should be established on further and higher education in Scotland whose remit shall include consideration of structures and future funding of the sector and student support.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1367.1.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-1367.1) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;and whose remit and membership shall be agreed in partnership with the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee and which shall be set up by the end of June 2008 and shall report to the Scottish Government and the Parliament by the end of 2009.&quot;</p>
