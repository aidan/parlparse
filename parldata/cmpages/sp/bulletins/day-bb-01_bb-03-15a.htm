                        welcomes the record £27 million package for the fishing

                        on 8 March 2001; notes that the joint objective of the 
                        Executive and the industry is the conservation of fish 
                        stocks and a sustainable long-term future for the fishing 
                        industry; further notes that best scientific advice is 
                        that these objectives are most effectively achieved through 
                        a targeted decommissioning scheme and immediate technical 
                        conservation measures; welcomes further research into 
                        these practical measures intended to reduce the number 
                        of discards and protect stocks of fish, and welcomes the 
                        fact that the Executive, taking into account the view 
                        expressed by the Parliament on 8 March 2001, is engaged 
                        in continuing discussion with the fishing industry to 
                        explore a degree of re-balancing of the £27 million package

                        recognises that credit unions are a valuable provider

                        for the credit union movement in Scotland, and supports 
                        its implementation and the objective of building a vibrant 
                        self-sustaining credit union movement in Scotland, accessible 
                        to all, with credit unions as broad based, community owned 
                        financial institutions operating in a sound commercial
