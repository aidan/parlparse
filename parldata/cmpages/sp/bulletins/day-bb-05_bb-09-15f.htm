          <p><strong>*S2M-3285</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>An Impartial Service?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the implications of the opening of National Archives of Scotland file, SEP 10/556, for the perception of an impartial civil service; notes that for 30 years the British state concealed a report by Professor Gavin McCrone that strongly supported the economic case for independence, and calls for an assurance from the Scottish Executive that it has never used the civil service to try&nbsp;and undermine any political party or movement in the partisan way that the Scottish Office and Cabinet Office used the civil service to try and undermine the Scottish National Party in 1975.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3284</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>A Warneing to England</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the England cricket side on their success in regaining the Ashes from Australia; notes that Australian generosity will not begrudge them a win once in 18 years, but expresses every confidence that Australia will regain the Ashes at the next meeting between the two countries.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3283</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Christine&rsquo;s Wide Ball</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments of Christine Grahame MSP that cricket is a sport of &quot;only marginal interest in Scotland&quot;; believes that her comments ignore the facts that cricket is celebrating the 220th anniversary of the first-recorded match in Scotland in 1785, that there are an estimated 12,000 active cricketers of all ages in Scotland, that a sell-out crowd of 4,500 paid to see Scotland play Australia earlier this summer and that it is estimated that three times that number could have packed the Grange in Edinburgh had there been capacity for them and that the BBC considered interest in the match to be sufficient to show the game live, that eight of the 20 players from the smaller countries which qualified for the ICC World Cup invited to a pre-World Cup training camp are Scottish and three are Scots-born Asians, and celebrates Scottish cricket&rsquo;s proud record in helping people from across the world integrate into their local communities in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3282#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Drumchapel High School Pupils&rsquo; Support for the Vucaj Family</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its admiration for the pupils of Drumchapel High School in Glasgow who have organised a petition which has already attracted hundreds of signatures in support of their friends and fellow pupils, Nimet, aged 16, and Saida Vucaj, aged 13, who were taken from their home in Scotstoun at 7.00 am on Tuesday 13 September 2005 following the rejection of their family&rsquo;s asylum application; conveys concern at the apparently heavy-handed nature of the family&rsquo;s eviction which saw Elvis Vucaj handcuffed by one of several immigration officials drafted in to extract the family from their home and the youngest child, Saida Vucaj, removed in her pyjamas; hopes that the pupils&rsquo; petition will play an important part in attempting to convince the Home Office to grant the family a stay of removal pending a case review; agrees that these acts of solidarity and support, including staff members at Drumchapel High School writing to Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary, in support of the Vucaj family&rsquo;s case, not only exemplify the goodwill which exists towards asylum seekers in Scotland but also demonstrate the philosophy behind the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s &quot;One Scotland, Many Cultures&quot; campaign, and considers that the pupils should be congratulated for their stance.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3281</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Scottish Medicines Consortium - Breast Cancer Drug, Arimidex, Approved Ahead of the Rest of the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) for backing, ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom, the use in Scotland of the breast cancer drug, anastrazole (Arimidex) for first-line therapy in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive early invasive breast cancer; notes that in trials this drug cut the risk of cancer returning in older woman to less than one in four, and further notes that the backing is ahead of the appraisal by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) who may not be appraising this drug until November 2006 due to funding cuts of &pound;3.5 million.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3280</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Congratulations on a Great Summer for British Cricket</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates England&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s cricket team on winning the Ashes for the first time in 18 years, England&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s team for winning their Ashes series against Australia for the first time in over 40 years and Scotland&rsquo;s cricketers for winning the ICC Trophy and qualifying for the 2007 Cricket World Cup; further congratulates both the Australian men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s cricket teams for playing their part in exciting Ashes series, and hopes that what was a superb summer for British cricket will help the further development of the game in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3279</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>NHS Greater Glasgow - Bed Review Consultation Time Should Be Longer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament urges NHS Greater Glasgow to reconsider the consultation period for the future of acute in-patient beds in greater Glasgow; notes that the bed-modelling document was only made public at a NHS Greater Glasgow board meeting on 26 July 2005, with views and comments to be received by mid-September 2005; further notes that a consultation of this magnitude needs more that seven weeks, especially given that the consultation started during the summer, and believes that NHS Greater Glasgow&rsquo;s own statement that &quot;developing proposals for service redesign and the related requirement for in-patient beds for a decade in advance is a difficult and challenging endeavour&quot; should reinforce the call for a longer consultation period so that all interested parties and members of the public should be able to have their views considered.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-3278.2</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Quality Teachers for the 21st Century</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3278) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;the significant&quot; to end and insert &quot;that Scottish teachers are the key drivers for excellence in our education system; further recognises that there will be a continuing need for significant investment in teacher recruitment and induction, initial teacher education and continuous professional development; notes the challenging nature of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s pledge to increase teacher numbers to 53,000 by 2007, given that 40% of Scottish teachers are due to retire in the next 10 years; is concerned that the recruitment of mathematics teachers is falling behind targets, threatening promised class-size reductions; commends the work of the General Teaching Council for Scotland in developing quality teaching, and calls on the Executive to fully fund the initial part of the chartered teacher programme for all Scottish teachers&quot;.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3278.3</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Quality Teachers for the 21st Century</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3278) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;significant&quot; to end and insert &quot;shortage of certain subject teachers in the secondary education sector; acknowledges that teacher morale has declined significantly due to recent changes in promoted post structures, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement a national strategy on promoted posts structures in conjunction with professional teaching organisations.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3274.1</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>It&rsquo;s Simply Not Cricket</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3274) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and inserts &quot;believes that the English victory in the Ashes Test, coupled with Scotland&rsquo;s 10th place in the world rankings, is helping to deliver a resurgence of interest in playing cricket in Scotland; further believes that there is something truly civilised about cricket, from the dulcet tones of Richie Benaud to the Yorkshire drawl of Geoffrey Boycott, the sense of fair play and sportsmanship between competing participants, the inclusive mixture of accents of all classes and regional accents and the physical bravery of facing a hard ball travelling at over 90 mph, to the skill of delivering a googly and the chess-like tactical fielding so that batsmen will play straight to silly point, all of which were on display during the Ashes Test; accepts that one group&rsquo;s minority sport is another community&rsquo;s central interest and that all should be given their place in the sun with excellence in any sport being reported by public service and commercial broadcasters; notes that this year&rsquo;s Ashes Test brought a tear to many an eye, including many Scots&rsquo;, and, in a world full of doom and gloom, made many people the world over feel proud to be British, and calls on members of the Scottish National Party to display greater generosity of spirit and for them to acknowledge that British sporting achievements which encourage young people to become physically active are to be welcomed rather than cheaply disparaged.&quot;</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2911#</strong> <strong>John Home Robertson:</strong> <strong>Affordable Rented Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the shortage of affordable rented housing in *East Lothian and* many communities and the fact that some applicants in overcrowded or unsuitable accommodation can be stuck on waiting lists for years, while others may be compelled to buy or rent housing that they cannot afford; suggests that there is a need for a clearer definition of affordability for the purposes of housing policy; welcomes initiatives by the Scottish Executive to help councils and registered social landlords to increase the supply of affordable housing, including prudential borrowing to fund new building; recognises that the high cost of development land is hindering that policy, and believes that there is a case for further measures to help local authorities to acquire and secure land for affordable housing in the Executive&rsquo;s proposed Planning Bill.</p>
