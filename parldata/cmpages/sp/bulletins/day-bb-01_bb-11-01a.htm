          <p>debate on the subject&#151;</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2142</strong> <strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing:</strong> <strong>Inverness 
            Airport and Links with Hub Airports</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the huge significance of direct links between Inverness Airport and 
            London hub airports to the economic and social well-being of the Highlands 
            and Islands, particularly in relation to tourism, exports, the business 
            economy and employment; expresses its grave concern at the possible 
            loss of landing slots at Gatwick; seeks not only to have such links 
            preserved but also to have similar slots at Heathrow restored, and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should pursue these matters vigorously 
            with the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions 
            and the European Commission. </p>
