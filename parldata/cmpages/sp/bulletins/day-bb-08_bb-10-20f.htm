<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2734</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Girlguiding UK - Girls Plus Action Equals Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Girlguiding UK on its Changing the World project; notes that 18 charities have teamed up with Girlguiding UK to offer members of the organisation support and suggestions to raise awareness, money or take direct action to make the world a better place; further notes that, as guiding nears its centenary in 2010, over 4,000 girls in Scotland and 50,000 across the United Kingdom are on waiting lists to join this great organisation and that, without the commitment of its leaders and volunteers, many girls and young women would not have the opportunity to enjoy guiding by making new friends, having fun, being challenged by new experiences, thinking for themselves and working as part of a team, and wishes the 3,460 members in Glasgow all success in making a difference in society today.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2733</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Proposed Increase in Charge to RNLI for Radio Channel Use</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by Ofcom that the annual charge paid by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) for the use of radio channels should be increased from &pound;40,000 to &pound;260,000; notes that the RNLI is a charitable organisation, whose lifeboats are staffed by volunteers who over the last year have rescued almost 8,000 individuals; believes that the increase in charge proposed has the potential to impact damagingly on the service provided by the RNLI, and urges Ofcom to abandon this proposed charge increase.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2732</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Energy Saving Week Campaign 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Energy Saving Trust for organising its 12th annual Energy Saving Week from 20 to 26 October 2008; recognises that energy efficiency is the cleanest, safest and cheapest way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions; notes that energy efficiency can play a key role in tackling fuel poverty but acknowledges that the Energy Saving Trust&rsquo;s independent research shows that people believe that a lack of time is a barrier to them taking energy saving measures; further notes that many actions, such as installing low energy lightbulbs or boiling only the amount of water that you need for a hot drink, actually take very little time; urges all MSPs to show leadership in their constituencies and regions by supporting Energy Saving Week and encouraging constituents to contact their local Energy Saving Scotland advice centre on 0800 512 012 for free, independent, home energy efficiency advice, and notes that since the Energy Saving Trust was established it has funded or influenced measures giving lifetime savings of over 100 million tonnes of CO2.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2731</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Universal Service Obligation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Communication Workers Union for its ongoing campaign to save the universal service obligation (USO) for the benefit of Royal Mail, its customers and its employees; looks forward to the final report from the review of the UK postal services sector, an independent panel headed by Richard Hooper, formerly Deputy Chairman of the Office of Communications (Ofcom), to be published in the autumn; notes that the review team&rsquo;s initial response in May 2008 stated that competition within the sector had &quot;brought no significant benefits&quot; to either the public or small businesses and went on to express its view that &quot;there is now a substantial threat to Royal Mail&rsquo;s financial stability and therefore, the universal service obligation&hellip;the status quo is not tenable.  It will not deliver our shared vision for the postal sector and there is a strong case for action&quot;; considers that the UK Government rushed into market liberalisation too quickly &ndash; some five years earlier than required by European Union legislation and some way ahead of the rest of the continent; believes that the decision to advance liberalisation together with the pro-competition brief given to industry regulator Postcomm and the operating restrictions that it has imposed on Royal Mail have combined to create a fundamentally skewed UK postal market, which unfairly advantages new competitor companies at the expense of the incumbent; is concerned that, while Royal Mail is obliged by law to provide a universal service and is subject to crippling price and product innovation restrictions, new market entrants are allowed, even encouraged, to cherry-pick business from the more profitable parts of the industry therefore eating into Royal Mail&rsquo;s traditional revenues while adding zero value to the service as a whole; is alarmed that the universal service recorded a loss of the first time in 2007-08 of around &pound;100 million compared to a profit of &pound;2 million the previous year, that Royal Mail&rsquo;s regulated business, which includes the USO, made a loss of over &pound;200 million in 2007-08 compared to a loss of &pound;69 million the previous year and that the Royal Mail&rsquo;s overall letter business also made a loss last year of &pound;3 million, down from a profit of &pound;136 million the previous year; understands that the USO is vital for Scotland, particularly with regard to the many rural and remote areas where communities are dependent on reliable postal services; concurs with the view that it is absolutely crucial that the Royal Mail remains a wholly publicly-owned, integrated company and that any moves towards privatisation, share flotation or joint venture with private capital or any separation of Post Office Limited from the Royal Mail Group by the UK Government must be resisted, and calls for Postcomm and its remit to be fundamentally reformed to refocus on defending the UK&rsquo;s postal services to the public, for USO to be supported, ensuring that it is funded by all who use the service so that it can then be protected and extended to cover small to medium-sized businesses and to preserve our post office network, and for the Royal Mail to be able to exercise more freedom over pricing and new product and service innovation in order to operate successfully and, in particular, to take advantage of the expanding parcels and packages market while understanding that modernisation must not become a code word for cuts and terminal decline.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2730</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Ofcom Charges for the RNLI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern Ofcom&rsquo;s consultation document, <em>Applying spectrum pricing to the Maritime and Aeronautical sectors</em>, which proposes cost increases for the use of VHF radio frequencies; further notes with particular concern section 1.18 of the consultation, which states that &quot;we are inviting views on whether charities whose objective is the safety of human life in an emergency should receive a discount&quot;; understands that the annual charge to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) could increase from &pound;40,000 to &pound;260,000; recognises that the RNLI is a national charity, supported and financed by volunteers, which provides a vital life-saving service; further recognises that the proposed cost increases will certainly threaten both local and national sea and mountain search and rescue charities across the country; believes that all charities whose objective is the safety of human life should receive a 100% discount on using radio frequencies, and calls on Ofcom to reject its current proposals and enter into a process to introduce a 100% discount for these vital life-saving services.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2725</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>This is Not an Invitation to Rape Me</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Rape Crisis Scotland&rsquo;s new campaign, This is Not an Invitation to Rape Me, which aims to tackle women-blaming attitudes towards rape in a nationwide advertising campaign; notes that many Scots still believe that women are in some way responsible for being raped if they are dressed in revealing clothing, are drunk, are flirting, or are known to have had many sexual partners; further notes that although rape within marriage was made a crime in Scotland from 1989, the myth persists that women are only raped by strangers and not their partners; believes that social attitudes continue to play a significant role in limiting justice for women who have experienced rape, with a Scottish conviction rate of only 2.9%, and in central Scotland as low as one conviction from seven prosecutions and 45 allegations, with an estimated 40% of rapes unreported, and congratulates the campaign for its use of distinctive images featuring women in everyday settings, challenging people&rsquo;s attitudes towards rape and tackling the myths and prejudices that undermine women&rsquo;s right to say no.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2724</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Support the Lessons from Auschwitz Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 16 October 2008 marks the last visit to Auschwitz organised and subsidised by the Holocaust Educational Trust and supporting school pupils to fly directly from Scotland; recognises the importance of successive generations learning about one of the most horrific crimes in human history; appreciates the impact that such trips have had on young people across Scotland, including those from Fife who organised the Anne Frank and You festival in Kirkcaldy marking Holocaust Memorial Day 2007; notes the renewed funding granted by UK ministers to allow two pupils from every school in England and Wales to continue to benefit from this moving and memorable experience, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider its approach to Holocaust education and to match the UK Government&rsquo;s funding in this devolved area of responsibility so that Scottish pupils can also continue to learn the &quot;Lessons from Auschwitz&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2723</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Borland&rsquo;s Delicatessen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Stewarton business Borland&rsquo;s Delicatessen, also known as Deli on the Corner, and partners Lyndsey Phillips and Dawn Borland and their team, on being named Scotland&rsquo;s Most Promising New Business in the British Chambers of Commerce Awards 2008; notes that the success of Borland&rsquo;s Delicatessen is based on the determination of the partners to bring good quality affordable products to consumers and to support local suppliers; commends this business model to others, and wishes Lyndsey Phillips and Dawn Borland well when they compete in the UK Awards at London&rsquo;s Natural History Museum on 27 November 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2722</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Eddy Gemmell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Eddy Gemmell, a North Ayrshire careers advisor and developer of radio programme The Careers Show in partnership with Community Learning and Development, on being selected for a 2008 National Career Award presented by the Institute of Careers Guidance (ICG); recognises that Mr Gemmell&rsquo;s award is for outstanding achievement in the area of social inclusion; notes that Mr Gemmell will be presented with his award at a prestigious ceremony on 14 November 2008, as part of the ICG Annual Career Guidance Conference and Exhibition to be held at the Mercure Holland House Hotel, Cardiff, on 13 and 14 November 2008; is aware that The Careers Show, which is produced and presented by Mr Gemmell with support from Careers Scotland, has continued to grow in popularity since it was first aired in June 2006; acknowledges that the show highlights a variety of careers with music in an entertaining manner, and understands that The Careers Show will soon be syndicated to other broadcasting networksthroughoutScotland to benefit a wider community audience.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2719</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Unemployment and Work-for-Dole Proposals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that, in the light of an increase in unemployment to 1.79 million, the UK Government proposes work-for-dole measures in its welfare reform green paper, <em>No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility</em>; considers that this amounts to punishing the victims of economic circumstance, and believes that positive measures would be both more just and more effective.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2716</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Secrecy Over Real Nuclear Threat Revealed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns secrecy and misinformation surrounding the nuclear industry as illustrated by documents only released after freedom of information requests revealed that key radiation alarms at Burghfield in England, where Britain&rsquo;s Trident warheads are dismantled and reassembled for maintenance, designed to detect an impending nuclear accident were disabled by last year&rsquo;s floods; regrets that, despite the consortium that runs Burghfield describing the risk of a critical nuclear event as incredible, the full details were deliberately kept from the public and local authorities, with UK defence ministers telling MPs that there had been only minor disruption, and believes that such manipulation by UK Government officials and the nuclear industry aimed at concealing the true dangers of nuclear weapons and energy offer further proof as to why the Parliament is justified in asserting opposition to nuclear energy and weapons.</p>

Scotland will now be unable to realise the &pound;75,000 fundraising target it hoped to achieve from the gala dinner; further notes that the loss of this potential income will impact directly on the future service and support available to young people, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that Who Cares? Scotland has adequate core funding to cover all of its planned work in the coming year, including those elements that the proceeds from the Gala Dinner would have financed.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2713</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>HBOS Takeover</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament gives a general welcome to the measures taken by the UK and other governments to tackle the current banking crisis but calls on the UK Government to reverse its decision to make the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS a condition of its bail-out funding; considers that the promises of the Lloyds TSB management that only the Scottish headquarters of the merged bank would be retained in Edinburgh are a totally inadequate response to Scottish demands and would result in a huge loss of jobs and decision-making powers in Scotland, particularly in Edinburgh and Fife, and calls on the UK Government to use its stakeholding in HBOS to retain it as an independent bank with its corporate headquarters in Edinburgh and to make this a condition of funding for HBOS.</p>
