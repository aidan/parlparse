          <P>The clerk has been advised of the topics of the following Scottish 
            Green Party business</P>
          <p>9.30 am&#9;Scottish Green Party Debate on Zero Waste-</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1089</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Zero 
            Waste</strong>-That the Parliament notes that, despite a small increase 
            in recycling and composting, the Scottish Executive is yet to achieve 
            any reduction in the overall production of waste; urges the Executive 
            to adopt a &quot;zero waste&quot; approach, which has the potential 
            to dramatically reduce waste from the design, production and use of 
            materials and products, to boost reuse, recycling and composting rates 
            and to cut costs for business, stimulate innovation and create more 
            &quot;green&quot; jobs in Scotland, and recommends that the Executive 
            produces a strategy for reaching a target of zero waste and reports 
            back to the Parliament on the potential of that policy for Scotland. 
          </P>

              <p><strong>S2M-1089.4</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald: Zero Waste</strong>-As 
                an amendment to motion (S2M-1089) in the name of Shiona Baird, 
                leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes 
                the recent increase in recycling and composting; notes paragraph 
                7.3.3 of the National Waste Plan 2003 which states that zero waste 
                &quot;provides a platform for challenging our current systems 
                and radically reducing waste beyond even the best current levels 
                of achievement&quot; and the aim in the National Waste Plan to 
                stop growth in the amount of municipal waste produced by 2010; 
                further notes the work being carried out by the Waste and Resources 
                Action Programme, Envirowise, the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency and others to minimise business and household waste; recognises 
                the Scottish Executive's commitment to increasing packaging recovery 
                targets from 59% to 70% by 2008, and calls on the Executive to 
                continue its work to prevent and minimise waste, to increase recycling 
                and to divert waste from landfill.&quot; </P>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1089.3</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Zero Waste</strong>-As 
                an amendment to motion (S2M-1089) in the name of Shiona Baird, 
                insert at end &quot;and further notes that many of the powers 
                required to reduce waste and achieve a sustainable Scotland reside 
                with Her Majesty's Government and that such powers should be transferred 
                to the Scottish Parliament.&quot; </P>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1089.2</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Zero Waste</strong>-As 
                an amendment to motion (S2M-1089) in the name of Shiona Baird, 
                leave out from &quot;urges&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes 
                that Scottish local authorities need to improve their recycling 
                performance by 15.4% over the next two years, three times the 
                figure they have achieved in the last four, to meet the Executive's 
                target of 25% of waste recycled by 2006; calls on the Executive 
                to admit that its top-down approach is not working, and, as an 
                alternative to a zero waste policy, urges it to allow local authorities 
                the flexibility to deliver the best solutions for their areas 
                in the long term.&quot; </P>

          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Green Party Debate on GM Crops-</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1091</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>GM 
            Crops</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the preliminary 
            legal opinion of independent counsel that the Scottish Executive had 
            discretion to use legal powers to refuse the next stage of GM maize 
            commercialisation which it chose not to exercise; calls for the Executive 
            to review its own legal advice on which its decision over GM maize 
            was based and to reassess the extent of its discretion accordingly, 
            and calls on the Executive to put on hold the decision on final consent 
            to the placement of GM maize on the UK National Seed List, at least 
            until it has reported back to the Parliament on the outcome of such 
            a legal review and satisfied the Parliament that the most legally-restrictive 
            policy possible toward GM commercialisation has been used. </P>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1091.1</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson: GM Crops</strong>-As

            that at present there is little support for commercialisation of GM 
            crops; further acknowledges the European and UK legislative framework 
            for GM; notes the legal advice provided by the parliamentary solicitor 
            to the Transport and the Environment Committee and the European and 
            External Relations Committee that the Scottish Executive is not permitted 
            by EU law to impose a blanket ban on, or blanket approval for, GM 
            crops; understands that decisions are required on a case by case basis; 
            welcomes the Executive's decision to reject the commercial growing 
            of spring GM oil seed rape and beet; notes that the Executive does 
            not have scientific evidence nor the powers to ban the cultivation 
            of GM maize; supports the Executive's decision to seek amendment to 
            the EU approval for Chardon LL maize to restrict its cultivation; 
            supports the Executive's decision not to agree seed listing for Chardon 
            LL unless and until such EU changes are made; welcomes the Executive's 
            commitment to consult on coexistence measures that will protect farmers 
            who wish to grow conventional or organic crops, give consumers the 
            choice not to consume GM foods, and introduce compensation and liability 
            measures; supports the Executive's initiative with the farming industry 
            to ensure consumer confidence and consumer choice in Scottish produce, 
            and welcomes the continuing commitment in the Partnership Agreement 
            to apply the precautionary principle.&quot; </P>

            the Parliament considers the continuing modernisation of the criminal 
            justice system to be an important priority; notes the progress made 
            to date to improve the delivery of a fair, efficient and accessible 
            service for victims, witnesses and the accused; welcomes the recent 
            report by Sheriff Principal McInnes into the operation of summary

          <p><strong>S2M-1003</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Crisis 
            for Borders Schools</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the proposed closure of the following Borders schools: Cranshaws, 
            Teviothead, Eccles/Leitholm, Hutton, Roberton, Ednam, Channelkirk, 
            Newlands, Oxnam, Glen Douglas, Heriot and Fountainhall; further notes 
            that Scottish Borders Council in its consultation document <em>Management 
            Review of the School Estate in the Scottish Borders</em>, in particular 
            the chart describing the factors that may be considered when making 
            decisions on the schools' long-term viability, did not include the 
            &quot;importance of the local school to the community&quot; which 
            had been included in the first stage evaluation; reminds the Scottish 
            Executive of its commitment in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> 
            to &quot;continued reform so that our public services are designed 
            and delivered around the needs of individuals and the community within 
            which they live&quot; and also its commitment in <em>Building our 
            Future Scotland's School Estate</em> to place &quot;the child at the 
            centre, meeting the needs of the individual&quot; and &quot;the school 
            at the heart of the community, meeting the needs of the communities&quot;; 
            believes that the proposed closures, against the expressed wishes 
            of many communities, are driven by the requirements of proposed PPP/PFI 
            school building programmes, and therefore believes that the Executive 
            should adhere to its aforesaid commitments and reject rural school 
            closure proposals which, if they proceed, will permanently damage 
            fragile communities. </P>
