<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4377</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>MOBO&rsquo;s Boost for Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the projection that the prestigious Music of Black Origin (MOBO) urban music awards ceremony will deliver a boost of around &pound;3.6 million to the Glasgow economy; notes that this figure takes into account the success of the MTV Europe Music Awards in Edinburgh in 2003; further notes that this is the first time that this major awards ceremony, which will be held at the SECC on 30 September 2009, has been staged outside London in its 13-year history, and recognises Glasgow&rsquo;s renowned status as a UNESCO City of Music.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4376</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Unelected Members of the UK Cabinet</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that as a result of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s recent reshuffle no fewer than seven members of the House of Lords are now entitled to attend meetings of the UK Cabinet; considers that this is the highest number since Winston Churchill was Prime Minister in 1951 and is more than the total number of Cabinet Secretaries in the Scottish Government; believes that this development reduces the democratic accountability of the UK Cabinet as well as reflecting the increasingly isolated position of the Prime Minister in his parliamentary party, and further believes that as the UK Government looks at reform of the Westminster Parliament it would do well to learn from the system by which Scottish Government ministers are subject to approval by the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4375</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Labour&rsquo;s Cut Exposed by Channel 4&rsquo;s FactCheck</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the most recent distinction of the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP, having been awarded one of the worst possible scores by Channel 4&rsquo;s FactCheck for factual accuracy in responses during Prime Minister&rsquo;s Questions on 10 June 2009; is of the view that such a marked achievement was accomplished through misrepresentation, exaggeration and massaging of statistics; believes that the Prime Minister could not resist attempting to hide the fact that his budget mimics Tory plans for future cuts in public services though billions have flowed to city bankers; questions the Prime Minister&rsquo;s resolve to undertake parliamentary reform when it appears that he is unable to control a seemingly never-ending need for fabrication; sees this exhibition of illusion as a befitting embodiment of Labour&rsquo;s UK leadership whereby results are massaged to show gain but, in real terms, we have lost; wishes to remind the Prime Minister that no amount of spin can hide that &pound;500 million will be cut from vital Scottish services in financial year 2010-11; looks forward to a time when Westminster can have grown-up discussions on how to protect frontline services, and hopes that the Prime Minister will emulate the SNP government&rsquo;s example of transparency, honesty and delivery, which seemingly, as experienced so often under Labour, has been disregarded.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4374</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Dig for Victory in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Edinburgh Community Backgreen Association&rsquo;s Dig for Victory in Edinburgh campaign to encourage people to come together and convert their tenement backgreens into allotments; congratulates the association on its exemplary work in providing people with tools and support to convert their backgreens into vibrant and working green spaces; sees the association&rsquo;s activities as a positive step towards encouraging people to source their food locally and engage with environmental issues in Edinburgh, and supports its &quot;backgreen blitz&quot; efforts to recruit 100 people in each community to revive local backgreens in the city.</p>
