          <p><strong>*S1M-2815</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow University 
            Student Accomodation Sell Off</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the plans of the University of Glasgow to sell off over half 
            of its student accommodation to a private housing association; further 
            notes the concerns of students with regard to resulting rent increases, 
            the lack of consultation with student bodies on campus and their exclusion 
            from key talks on the issue; believes that this can only result in 
            increased hardship for students already burdened with debt from loans 
            and tuition fees, and therefore calls on the University of Glasgow 
            to reconsider the decision to sell off its student accommodation.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2814</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Sun-Tanning Parlours</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern recent reports linking the operation 
            of sun-tanning parlours with criminal activities; further notes the 
            recent proliferation of such parlours particularly in Glasgow, and 
            urges the Scottish Executive to instigate an immediate moratorium 
            on the operation of sun-tanning parlours until such an investigation 
            has been completed.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2813</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: New Housing Partnership</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the motion passed by Labour-controlled Renfrewshire 
            Council whereby the council fully supports the retention of its housing 
            stock, supports the tenants' position that debt associated with the 
            council's houses should be written off without the need to transfer 
            ownership of housing stock, endorses the recommendations contained 
            within the Board Report and seeks an early meeting with Ministers 
            in order to develop options for retaining the housing stock within 
            council ownership with affordable rent levels, whilst delivering the 
            repairs and improvements identified within its consultant's report; 
            congratulates Renfrewshire Council for adopting SNP policy, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's 
            Government in order to ensure that funds are available to write off 
            the housing debt for councils that do not opt for housing stock transfer 
            in order to ensure that they are able to carry out any repairs needed.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2812</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil: Euro 2008</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the announcement that the Scottish Football 
            Association and the Football Association of Ireland are to launch 
            a joint bid to host the Euro 2008 football championships; notes that 
            every major party in the Parliament has, at least in the past if not 
            at present, supported such a joint bid; further notes the potential 
            of the bid to bring all the benefits for tourism and the economy that 
            would have resulted from a solo bid by Scotland without burdening 
            the country with four expensive and unneeded 30,000-seater stadiums; 
            looks forward to the opportunity of working and renewing ties with 
            our Irish neighbours, and urges the whole country to back the bid.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2811</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Spike Milligan 
            1918-2002</strong>-That the Parliament notes with sadness the death 
            of Spike Milligan at the age of 83; recognises his extraordinary contribution 
            to the development of satire, the extensive contribution he made in 
            support of a large number of charities and campaigning organisations 
            including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and the Society for the 
            Preservation of Victorian Lamposts; further notes that he was fiercely 
            against fox hunting, and conveys its sympathy to all of his family.<strong><em> 
            R</em></strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2810</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Code of Conduct 
            for Members of the Scottish Parliament: Confidentiality</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees to amend the <em>Code of Conduct for Members 
            of the Scottish Parliament</em> by replacing Section 9.4 with Section 
            9.4 as set out in Annex D of the Standards Committee's 8th Report 
            2001, <em>Report on the Investigation of Unauthorised Disclosures</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2809</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Sport for Disabled 
            People in the Scottish Borders and the Waterside Fitness Club, Jedburgh</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the representatives from the Scottish 
            Borders who will be taking part in the World Special Olympics in Dublin 
            in 2003, namely badminton players Ronald Young, Graeme Lang and Steven 
            George, swimmer Alan German, Gordon Yule the UK badminton coach and 
            Jed Renilson the Assistant Head of Delegation; notes with concern 
            that Jedburgh swimming pool is currently under threat of closure due 
            to the £5.9 million cuts by Scottish Borders Council's administration 
            at a time when athletes from all over the Borders attend the pool 
            for Special Olympics Regional Squad sessions on a weekly basis and 
            that the pool is essential not only for those athletes, but the entire 
            community, with swimming lessons taking place Monday to Saturday with 
            16 classes and 10 pupils to a class, disabled lessons with 1 to 1 
            tuition and waiting lists for all swimming lessons, parent and baby 
            classes, fun sessions for children and crash swimming courses; further 
            notes that the pool is used by over 600 pupils per week from the primary 
            schools Parkside, Howdenburn, Hobkirk, Keilder/Bryness, Glendouglas, 
            Jedburgh Grammar, Earlston High and Howdenburn School House Special 
            Needs with disabled dippers' groups, community education group canoeing, 
            Jedburgh Rugby Football Club and Women's Borders Aid also as user 
            groups, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that this 
            essential community facility does not close. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2808</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Ratification of 
            the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 
            on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes that Her Majesty's Government has not yet ratified 
            the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 
            on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict; notes the interest 
            of this Parliament in protecting the rights of children; believes 
            that children under 18 are entitled to the protection of the safeguards 
            in the Protocol, and urges Her Majesty's Government to ratify the 
            Protocol as soon as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2807</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Lack of General 
            Practitioner in Helmsdale</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText" id="MotionText">regrets 
            the recent decision by Highland NHS Board not to seek a replacement 
            general practitioner for Helmsdale; notes the negative impact which 
            this will have on the local community; condemns the Board's consultation 
            process as deeply flawed; deplores the fact that some residents must 
            now have to travel up to fifty miles for the services of a GP, and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to do all it can to ensure that 
            a GP is appointed in Helmsdale as soon as possible.</a></p>

            Rhino with pornographic websites featuring the drugging, abduction 
            and rape of women, and therefore *believes that* the Scottish Executive 
            *should* investigate this matter urgently and take whatever action
