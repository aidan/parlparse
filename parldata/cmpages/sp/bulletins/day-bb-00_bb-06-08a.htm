                        Thomson:</strong> <strong>Women's Pay - 30 Years on from the Equal 
                        Pay Act</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that 
                        30 years after the introduction of the Equal Pay Act women 
                        earn only 73.3% of average male earnings; notes further 
                        that Aberdeen has the widest discrepancy between men and 
                        women's earnings in Scotland, with women in Aberdeen earning 
                        only 64.2% of men's earnings; believes that these figures 
                        clearly show that legislation in itself has failed to 
                        deliver parity in the labour market; believes that the 
                        Scottish Executive and its economic development agencies 
                        should pursue policies that would assist in the equalisation 
                        of pay between the genders, and asks the Scottish Executive, 
                        whilst pursuing the creation of a knowledge economy, to 
                        put in place adequate monitoring and evaluation to ensure 
                        that women will become equal players in the labour market.
