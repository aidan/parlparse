<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7189 Robin Harper: Save Crags Sports Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the reported decision by Edinburgh Leisure to close the Crags Sports Centre in the Southside of Edinburgh unless another operator can be found; understands that this closure is in response to recent cuts in Edinburgh Leisure&rsquo;s funding by City of Edinburgh Council and that other closures may follow, including Dalry Swim Centre, Kirkliston Leisure Centre and Portobello Golf Course; considers that the Crags Sports Centre was opened in 2003 after years of campaigning and fundraising by local people and that it boasts a large sports hall with a well-equipped gym and an all-weather pitch; understands that the Crags Sports Centre is a well-used centre situated beside one of the most deprived areas of the city and that, in addition to the centre serving local people, the Active Schools Programme of neighbouring schools and the locally based Canongate Youth Project depend on the centre for its facilities, and calls on City of Edinburgh Council to ensure that the Crags Sports Centre is kept open.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7188 Murdo Fraser: 2010 Rally of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes to Perth and Kinross and to Stirling the 2010 Rally of Scotland, which is scheduled to takes place from 15 to 17 October 2010; notes that Scone Palace will host the ceremonial start of the rally and Stirling Castle will hold the traditional champagne ceremony to mark the end; believes that what is considered the beauty and challenge of the landscape of Perthshire and Stirlingshire will make the perfect setting for the 2010 rally; notes that some of those considered to be among the world&rsquo;s top rally drivers will follow a route that will take them through what it believes are some of Britain&rsquo;s best rallying courses, including Craigvinean, Drummond Hill, Errochty, Achray and Loch Ard, and believes that the event will provide spectators and competitors with a thrilling and exciting experience and that the rally will be a tremendous boost to the local economy, underlining that Perthshire and Stirlingshire are ideal locations for prestigious events.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7187 Patrick Harvie: Fossil Fuel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament shares the ambition of the current administration that Scotland should meet 100% of its electricity demand from renewables by 2025 and considers this an achievable goal; deeply regrets, however, that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s wider energy policy appears to contradict this objective; is concerned at the support that has been given for what it considers a dramatic expansion of open-cast coal extraction and the current support being expressed for exploratory deep-water oil drilling at the Lagavulin prospect; expresses dismay that MEPs voted against a moratorium on exploratory drilling on 6 October 2010; considers that carbon emissions will not be reduced simply by renewable electricity generation but by the reduction and ultimate elimination of the burning of fossil fuels; understands that the world already has sufficient fossil fuel reserves to make the generally agreed goal of limiting climate change to two degrees impossible to achieve; therefore considers that there is no justification for further exploration in search of new reserves, and calls on the Scottish Government to oppose the continued hunt for new fossil fuels by every means at its disposal.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7186 Pauline McNeill: National Poetry Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates National Poetry Day, 7 October 2010; remembers with sadness the death of the Scottish Makar, Edwin Morgan; recognizes the work of Robert Burns, Carol Ann Duffy and Liz Lochhead, whom it considers to be great Scottish poets; believes poetry to be a great art form, and will continue to promote it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7185 Margaret Mitchell: The Commonwealth Orchard</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St John the Baptist Primary School in Uddingston for being the only school thus far in Central Scotland to participate in the Commonwealth Orchard programme, which helps and encourages school pupils and members of the wider community to plant fruit trees and soft-fruit plants in the hope that they will bear fruit ripe for the picking for use at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow; acknowledges that the pupils of P5 and P6 of the school planted apple trees with the help of friends, teachers, parents and the local group, Uddingston Pride, and hopes that more schools and communities will participate in the scheme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7184 Patricia Ferguson: Recognising Glasgow&rsquo;s Community Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the finalists and winners of the Evening Times Community Champion Awards following the grand final ceremony held in Glasgow City Chambers on 6 October 2010; notes the contribution made to the communities throughout Glasgow over many years by those celebrated at the ceremony; thanks them for their hard work and wishes them well for the future, and also congratulates the <em>Evening Times</em> and Glasgow City Council for providing a forum whereby previously unsung heroes of Scotland&rsquo;s local communities can be recognised.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7183 Cathy Jamieson: 10 Years of yipworld.com</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates yipworld.com, based in Cumnock, on its 10th anniversary; considers that Janice Hendry and her dedicated team of staff and volunteers have carried out innovative work; recognises the contribution made by yipworld.com&rsquo;s board of directors and East Ayrshire Council; notes that yipworld.com has been successful in securing funding to run a men into childcare course, and wishes the project every success in its future work with young people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7182 Rob Gibson: F&agrave;ilte gu Mod Ghallaibh, Welcome to Caithness Mod</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates enthusiasts in Caithness and North Sutherland for being successful in their bid to mount this year&rsquo;s festival of Gaelic culture, Mod Ghallaibh 2010; looks to a hearty Caithness welcome for the competitors and participants at this year&rsquo;s event, from 8 to 16 October, in Wick and Thurso; believes that what is considered to be the multiple linguistic heritage of Caithness should be enhanced by a heightened awareness of the Gaelic strand of that heritage; seeks to realise a legacy from the Mod of increasing cultural confidence in the far north as its economy transfers its focus onto renewable energy sources from wind, wave and tidal power as well as the sustainable produce of land and sea, and seeks both public and private sector commitment to maintain and increase the connection between a healthy economy and confident rooted communities, which it believes that a successful Mod can underpin.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7181 Kenneth Gibson: Heritage Lottery Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the reported proposal to merge the Heritage Lottery Fund with English Heritage; considers that such a merger would result in grant applicants from Scotland having to contact the English body; believes that, as an England-only advisory body, English Heritage has a very different remit from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which is a UK-wide lottery distributor that does not give grants to private owners; welcomes what it considers the vital funding that the Heritage Lottery Fund provides for a wide range of projects and institutions throughout Scotland; considers that, with every grant that the Heritage Lottery Fund gives, numerous jobs and training placements are created and other people are provided with the opportunity to learn about heritage and develop a wide range of skills and knowledge; believes that failure to consult heritage bodies and communities throughout the UK represents exactly the sort of public and local disenfranchisement that the UK coalition government supposedly wanted to overturn, and is apprehensive about the implications that such a merger could have, with thousands of jobs and millions of pounds-worth of essential funding potentially lost.</p>

<p>Supported by: Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7179 Liam McArthur: St Andrew&rsquo;s School Green Flag Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that St Andrew&rsquo;s Primary school in Orkney, which provides nursery and primary education for the children of Deerness, Holm, St Mary&rsquo;s, Tankerness and Toab, raised the flag for its first Green Flag award on 7 October 2010; believes that the school community has worked hard to recycle waste and to develop its grounds by planting bulbs, trees and bushes and developing a pond and wetland area; further notes that the award adds to what is considered the excellent record of Orkney schools in the Green Flag awards, and congratulates the St Andrew&rsquo;s School staff, pupils and parents on their Green Flag award, which recognises their hard work to develop a green school that matches what is seen as the pristine Orkney environment in which it sits.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7178 Kenneth Gibson: Dairy Prices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the current trading relationship between supermarkets and Scotland&rsquo;s dairy farmers; believes that Scottish dairy farmers are being squeezed into financially unviable situations by supermarkets intent on profiteering at the expense of fair treatment and equitable trade; points to the findings of DairyCo&rsquo;s annual <em>Dairy Supply Chain Margins</em> report, which shows that, in the financial year ending March 2010, supermarkets managed to increase their margins on all three dairy products, fresh milk, mild and mature cheddar, despite only marginal changes in the retail prices being charged to consumers; notes that, in the same 12-month period, margins for those processing milk were squeezed and the average price paid to farmers for their milk fell by 2p to 23.8p per litre; finds it incomprehensible and unscrupulous that supermarkets should pay this price to dairy farmers considering that the cost of producing milk on a farm was estimated at this time to be between 26p and 27p per litre; is shocked to note reports that, while dairy farmers make a loss of 2p to 3p on every litre that they produce, supermarkets make a profit of between 15p and 18p on every litre that they sell; understands that individual major retailers sell between 400 million and 1 billion litres of milk annually, thus making profits of between &pound;60 million and &pound;180 million every year; believes that Scottish dairy farmers are being exploited, and considers that they should be paid a fair rate for their produce.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7177 Elizabeth Smith: The Education (Lower Primary Class Sizes) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Education (Lower Primary Class Sizes) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2010 (SSI 2010/326).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7174 Ms Wendy Alexander: Voices in Paisley 2010 Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Voices in Paisley 2010 Music Festival for organising what is considered a successful choral programme for the seventh year running; notes that Aled Jones will perform in Paisley for the first time ever supporting the Festival Chorus at Paisley Abbey;considers the festival to be a significant contribution to arts and culture through its ability to attract a wide range of national and international performers, and commends all voluntary, civic and public bodies working to promote Paisley as Scotland&rsquo;s choir town.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7062.1 Johann Lamont: Monitoring Poverty and Social Exclusion in Scotland 2010</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7062) in the name of John Wilson, insert at end &quot;; notes with particular concern the finding that the child poverty rate in Scotland rose during the recession, whereas it fell in England, reversing the pattern of preceding years and that, having gone into recession in a better position on unemployment than England, this advantage has now been lost, with Scottish unemployment higher than at any point since 1996; notes with similar concern that the report identified gaps and weaknesses in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s programme, and considers that this underlines the case for the swift return, at both Holyrood and Westminster, of governments that make the eradication of poverty and social exclusion a national priority.&quot;</p>
