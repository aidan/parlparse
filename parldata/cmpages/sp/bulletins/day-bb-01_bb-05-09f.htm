            May 2001; notes that changes in the way that babies are positioned 
            for sleep has helped reduce cot deaths in Scotland by 60%; is concerned 
            by the link between cigarette smoke and cot death, with an estimated 
            seven-fold increase in risk for infants of women who smoke during 
            pregnancy; further notes the Cot Death Trust’s warning that the 100% 
            increase in 15-year-old girls smoking in the past 10 years could result 
            in an alarming rise in the number of cot deaths, and therefore welcomes

            Tourist Board/visitscotland which has undermined efforts to regenerate 
            Scottish tourism following two years of decline; calls upon the Scottish

            of those with ME have difficulty in obtaining benefits to which they

            representatives on the UK Working Group on ME established in 1999, 
            should emphasise these difficulties in order that no-one who is disabled
