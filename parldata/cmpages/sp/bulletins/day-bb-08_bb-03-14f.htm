<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1576</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Grampian Police</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Grampian Police on the news that its officer numbers have passed 1,500 for the first time; believes that this will help boost the fight against crime across the north east, and looks forward to further progress across all police forces toward the Scottish Government&rsquo;s target of 1,000 new police officers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1575</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Lance Corporal Domhnall Phadruig Campbell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the bravery of Lance Corporal Domhnall Phadruig Campbell from South Uist, of the 26th Regiment Royal Engineers, for &quot;an incredible act of pre-meditated bravery&quot; in Helmand province, Afghanistan, and congratulates him for being awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for driving his unarmoured tractor into a war zone under intense fire for a sustained period of time.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1574</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Scott&rsquo;s Porage Oats Green Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the decision of Quaker to invest &pound;6 million pounds in a combined heat and power biomass boiler at Uthrogle Mills, Cupar, home of the world famous Scott&rsquo;s Porage Oats; notes that the boiler will use oat husks, a waste product from processing oats at the mill, making it carbon neutral, reducing direct carbon emissions by 9,000 tonnes and reducing transport of waste oat husks by 170,000 miles a year, equivalent to a further 600 tonnes of carbon emissions, and urges other businesses throughout Scotland to follow the lead of Quaker by examining how to cut waste and carbon emissions in their processes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1573</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Opportunities and Success for Young Women in YWCA Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates YWCA Scotland President, Kirsty Kelly, on her election to the YWCA World Board; notes that Kirsty, from Kinghorn in Fife, is still in her early twenties; recognises that this is a huge personal achievement and honour for Kirsty, as well as recognition for the work of YWCA Scotland in developing young women&rsquo;s leadership; further notes that Kirsty&rsquo;s election means that a member of YWCA Scotland has held a leadership place at world level for three consecutive terms, as her predecessor, Julie Dickson was from Kirkcaldy and served two terms at this level, and considers it particularly relevant, as we celebrate International Women&rsquo;s Day, to recognise these young women who have been great ambassadors for Scotland and exemplars of the life changing opportunities available in the YWCA.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1572</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Dignity and Integrity for All</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the lecture given by the Rt Rev Joseph Devine, Bishop of Motherwell, at St Aloysius&rsquo; College on Tuesday 11 March 2008; condemns his claim that homosexuals were not persecuted during the holocaust and his suggestion that the imprisonment of Oscar Wilde and other homosexuals was appropriate; observes that according to figures of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, 100,000 men were arrested as homosexuals by the Third Reich between 1933 and 1945 and that it is estimated that over 10,000 homosexuals died as a result of the Holocaust; further notes that in many countries homosexuality is today punishable by death or imprisonment, and urges all churches to defend the dignity and integrity of every individual regardless of sexual orientation.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1570</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Local Heroes Exhibition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the <em>Local Heroes </em>exhibition at the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock, which features portraits painted by young artists from Auchinleck Academy and Cumnock Academy and museum displays created by young curators from Netherthird Primary School and schools throughout East Ayrshire; recognises the exciting and innovative work done by cultural co-ordinator Elaine Scott in conjunction with renowned artist Andrew Ratcliffe in bringing about this exhibition which highlights some of the most famous figures in the heritage of East Ayrshire, and commends the work of primary and secondary school pupils from throughout East Ayrshire whose work is featured in the exhibition.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1567&diams; </strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>A Call for Better Epilepsy Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming <em>More specialist nurses, better epilepsy care </em>campaign being run by Epilepsy Scotland for National Epilepsy Week 2008; commends the outstanding support that Epilepsy Scotland gives to the estimated 40,000 people in Scotland with this condition; acknowledges the valuable contribution specialist epilepsy nurses make to patient-centred treatment and epilepsy management; recognises the cost savings that these nurse posts make by reducing hospital stays, decreasing consultants&rsquo; workload and uncovering misdiagnosis and overtreatment; encourages NHS Scotland to address the shortfall in posts which means access to an epilepsy specialist nurse is a postcode lottery; notes that five NHS boards are without either paediatric, adult or learning disability nurses; believes that funding should be provided for additional epilepsy specialist nurses; advises that the recommendation of the Joint Epilepsy Council of the UK and Ireland for one specialist nurse for adult, paediatric and learning disability, per 100,000 of the population be followed in Scotland; acknowledges that resources for medical and administrative support must be available for specialist nurses to allow them to work effectively; suggests that increased specialist nurse provision will contribute towards related HEAT targets for an improved healthcare experience and rates of attendance at accident and emergency departments, and believes that the requests in this motion relate directly to plans contained in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Better Health, Better Care </em>strategy for a healthier Scotland, launched on 12 December 2007.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1566</strong> <strong>Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>Scotch Whisky</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt. Hon Alistair Darling MP, to raise the duty on scotch whisky by a staggering 59 pence; notes that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s own figures show that the increase in duty is likely to reduce revenue; considers that this move is extremely ill-timed and will threaten sales and jobs in the whisky and associated industries, and calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to reverse this decision without delay.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1565</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Un-Christian Remarks of Bishop Devine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the hurt which will be caused to gay people, and gay Catholics in particular, by the unfortunate, outdated and un-Christian remarks of Bishop Devine; believes that all enlightened Catholics reject all forms of prejudice including racism, sectarianism and homophobia, and acknowledges that we must all remember and learn from the past in order to equip ourselves with the tools to tackle prejudice in all its forms which includes acknowledging the rights of the LGBT community to mark Holocaust Memorial Day.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1563</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Homophobia Has No Place in Scottish Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with weary dismay the most recent remarks made by Bishop Joseph Devine which suggest that LGBT communities should not be present at Holocaust memorial events; recognises in particular that many thousands of gay men were arrested, imprisoned and killed by the Nazi regime and that many of these were later rounded up and re-imprisoned by the allies, being seen at the time as &quot;legitimate&quot; targets; welcomes the significant progress which has since been made across Europe toward recognising the equal dignity and worth of all people regardless of sexual orientation or transgender identity; is concerned at further remarks by the Bishop which appear to encourage parents not to tolerate their gay, lesbian or bisexual children; believes that such remarks are homophobic and deeply harmful to society and to young LGBT people who are contemplating coming out to their families, and commits itself to continuing to work toward a society in which prejudice and discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and transgender identity are a thing of the past.</p>
