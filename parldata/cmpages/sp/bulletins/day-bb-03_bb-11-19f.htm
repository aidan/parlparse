          <p><strong>*S2M-628</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Small 
            Business, Energy and the Environment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the <em>Energy and Environment SME Toolkit</em>, produced 
            by the Federation of Small Businesses in association with the Scottish 
            Energy Efficiency Office; notes that it is an example of good practice, 
            demonstrating that addressing environmental concerns saves energy 
            and money and reduces the nation&rsquo;s environmental footprint, 
            and recommends the toolkit to all small businesses in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-627</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Progress 
            in Respect of Fuel Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the new fuel poverty figures from the Scottish House Condition 
            Survey 2002 as good news for Scotland; endorses the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s 
            current fuel poverty programmes, and reaffirms the commitment to eradicate 
            fuel poverty as far as reasonably practicable by 2016.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-626</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>State 
            Visit to Britain by the President of the United States of America</strong>&mdash;That 
            the Parliament notes the inappropriate and insensitive timing of the 
            state visit to Britain by the President of the United States of America, 
            George W Bush; believes, however, that this visit can serve as a reminder 
            of the many military and civilian casualties since the commencement 
            of war in Iraq and the many still suffering in the aftermath; expresses 
            solidarity with the United States citizens who opposed the conflict; 
            notes that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have exacerbated instability 
            worldwide, and calls for an end to such pre-emptive attacks on some 
            of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable peoples and, instead, encourages 
            engagement with the United Nations to promote peace, equality and 
            an end to world poverty.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="625"></a>*S2M-625</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> 
            <strong>Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises 
            that only in an independent socialist Scotland will the obscene poverty 
            and inequality that scars our nation be permanently tackled; recognises, 
            however, that the limited powers available to it currently must be 
            utilised fully to tackle the root causes of poverty as effectively 
            as possible; accepts that it has complete power over pay and conditions 
            in the public sector which involves almost 500,000 workers; resolves, 
            in order to eradicate low pay and improve working conditions, to introduce 
            a public sector minimum wage set at the internationally recognised 
            European decency threshold and a maximum working week of 35 hours 
            to tackle the socially destructive long hours culture which currently 
            pervades too many Scottish workplaces; believes that a &pound;7.50 
            per hour minimum wage and 35 hours a week policy funded by the abolition 
            of Scottish Enterprise and full utilisation of existing block grant 
            will eradicate low pay in the public sector and help increase wages 
            in the private sector, and resolves to continue collectively the push 
            for full independence and democratic control over Scotland&rsquo;s 
            vast wealth and resources to improve the standard and quality of life 
            of all Scotland&rsquo;s citizens.</p>

            subservience of the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who now shares the 
            responsibility for the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqis and dozens 
            of British service personnel; considers that the UK Parliament and 
            the Scottish Parliament were deceived into backing an illegal, immoral 
            and unjustified war; believes that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

            the closure of Stade nuclear power station as the beginning of the 
            end of nuclear power in Germany and looks forward to the impending 
            closure of Chapelcross nuclear power station in Dumfriesshire as the
