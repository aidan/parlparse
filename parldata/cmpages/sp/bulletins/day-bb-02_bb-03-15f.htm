          <p><strong>*S1M-2913</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Skill Force 
            Pilot Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the early success 
            of the pilot scheme &quot;Skill Force&quot; being undertaken in schools 
            in North Lanarkshire in conjunction with retired armed forces instructors; 
            notes the increased attainment and improving attendance and attitude 
            of pupils within the pilot who were previously disengaged from the 
            education system; further notes that the pilot has also been welcomed 
            by pupils themselves, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to give 
            further freedom to Scotland's schools to introduce local initiatives 
            to inspire those pupils to benefit from education who are disengaged 
            from the standardised academic approach.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2912</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Streaming in 
            Schools</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates St. Paul's High 
            School, Pollok, Glasgow on its decision to reverse decades of dogma 
            by reintroducing streaming for its S1 and S2 pupils; welcomes the 
            increased diversity that this brings to Scotland's education system, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to confirm that decisions on streaming 
            and other diverse approaches to improving educational attainment should 
            be a matter for individual schools to determine in order to increase 
            choice for parents within our state school system.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2911</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Stirling's 
            Successful Bid for City Status</strong>-That the Parliament warmly 
            congratulates Stirling on being awarded city status as part of celebrations 
            to mark Her Majesty The Queen's Golden Jubilee, as well as the four 
            other successful applicants from across the UK: Preston, Newport, 
            Lisburn and Newry.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2910</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Transport Infrastructure 
            in Aberdeen</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that Aberdeen 
            is the only city of its size in the UK that does not have a by-pass; 
            further notes that, according to the Aberdeen branch of the Institute 
            of Directors, the cost to the community of Aberdeen's inadequate transport 
            infrastructure is in the region of £20 million per year and that others 
            estimate the cost to be nearer £100 million; recognises that Aberdonians 
            living near the current trunk roads suffer from the effects of air 
            and noise pollution from heavy traffic and have their safety put at 
            risk; notes that the Labour group on Aberdeen City Council have decided 
            to close the Grandholm Bridge from 10 July 2002, which will cause 
            further traffic chaos in the city, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to recognise that Aberdeen and the north east are an economic powerhouse 
            whose future well-being is vital to Scotland and to allocate the resources 
            necessary to construct a western peripheral route, with a third bridge 
            over the River Don. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2909#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Underfunding 
            of Glasgow City Council in Respect of Roads Maintenance, Winter Maintenance 
            and Street Lighting </strong>-That the Parliament believes that Glasgow 
            City Council is badly underfunded in terms of Grant-Aided Expenditure 
            (GAE) in respect of roads maintenance, winter maintenance and street 
            lighting; notes (a) that GAE for roads maintenance is calculated using 
            a standard set of parameters, based on carriageway length without 
            taking account of road width, except in the case of dual carriageways, 
            additional funding also being granted for principal roads and roads 
            constructed over peat, (b) that Glasgow, in common with other cities, 
            has a large number of roads greater in width than is standard, resulting 
            in, for example, a five-lane road such as Hope Street, which is not 
            untypical in the city, receiving the same allocation as a single track 
            road in Argyll, (c) that Glasgow City Council is adversely affected 
            by parameters concerning the lengths of roads classified as principal 
            routes, i.e. routes that link population centres, whereby Glasgow, 
            as a population centre, is linked to other such centres by roads of 
            which the majority of the length lies in other authority areas, such 
            as (i) Perth and Kinross Council area through which principal routes 
            pass in order to link centres outwith the authority area and where 
            433km of such routes account for 18% of total road network and (ii) 
            Western Isles Council area where 333km of principal routes constitute 
            the main road network and account for 28% of total road network, compared 
            with 132km of principal routes in the Glasgow City Council area which 
            account for only 7% of total road network, (d) that the parameters 
            on lengths of principal routes do not result in the calculation of 
            a figure that is fair to urban authorities and, consequently, a secondary 
            factor is applied, based on the number of private light goods vehicle 
            licences registered within the local authority area, which, as an 
            indicator, is also of little use as light goods vehicles and cars 
            do little damage to the structure of the road compared with heavy 
            goods vehicles (HGVs), (e) that the registration of HGVs cannot be 
            used as a measure as, for example, they are registered at the address 
            of the company's headquarters which is not necessarily located in 
            the area in which the vehicles operate, (f) that buses similarly have 
            a more detrimental effect on roads and, whilst roads in rural areas 
            may only see two or three buses a day, 2,780 buses use Hope Street 
            in Glasgow each day, (g) that other factors not considered for the 
            purposes of calculating GAE include (1) commuting, tourism and shopping, 
            which are obviously major issues for Glasgow but for few other authorities 
            and almost none of the rural authorities, (2) drainage of rainwater 
            from roads, which, in Glasgow, necessitates the maintenance of a network 
            of road gullies whilst in rural areas rainwater drains into adjacent 
            fields and ditches, (3) footways, which, in Glasgow, are often wide 
            in order to cope with large numbers of pedestrians<font color="#000080"> 
            </font>whereas there are often no footways on rural roads and (4) 
            the provision of street furniture, such as signs, pedestrian barriers, 
            bollards and traffic control, which is more widespread in Glasgow 
            than in rural areas, (h) that, in cities, there are many more customers 
            for public utilities which, in turn, leads to more excavation of carriageways 
            and subsequent re-instatement to a standard that leads to potholes 
            and general deterioration of the road surface, whilst in rural areas 
            such excavations are few and far between leading to fewer potholes 
            and a more<font color="#000080"> </font>homogeneous surface and (i) 
            that, in Glasgow, almost all roads are lit whilst in rural areas only 
            a small percentage of roads are lit; considers that the combined effect 
            of such factors is such that, in comparison with local authorities 
            that are responsible for rural areas, Glasgow is considerably worse 
            off, and further considers that the method of calculating GAE in respect 
            of roads maintenance, winter maintenance and street lighting should 
            be changed and improved in order to deliver more adequate funding 
            for Glasgow City Council and for other urban authorities.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2908#</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Court of Appeal 
            Opinion on Appeal Against Conviction of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the Opinion of the Appeal Court of 14 March 2002 
            refusing the appeal against conviction of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al 
            Megrahi; commends the hard work and diligence of the Crown Office 
            team in the presentation of the Crown case; acknowledges the sterling 
            public service rendered by the Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd QC, his predecessor 
            the Right Honourable the Lord Hardie, Alastair Campbell QC, Alan Turnbull 
            QC, Jonathan Lake and Morag Armstrong together with the Crown Office, 
            fiscal service, police and investigatory officers and staff and those 
            nationally and internationally who co-operated with and assisted them 
            in the course of the investigation and prosecution of the case, together 
            with the emergency services, church folk, friends and carers who cared 
            for and continue to support the ground survivors, the families and 
            friends of the 270 murder victims of the explosion of Flight Pan Am 
            103 to New York while in flight near to Lockerbie on 21 December 1988, 
            and considers that the Government of Libya should comply fully with 
            the terms of the United Nations Security Council resolution.<strong><em>

            in Glenrothes, Fife, on achieving a very successful report from Her 
            Majesty's Inspectorate of Education, which identified a number of
