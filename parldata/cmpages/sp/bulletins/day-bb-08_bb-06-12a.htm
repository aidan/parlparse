<p><strong>9.15am</strong> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Education Cuts&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2120</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Education Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the lack of confidence expressed by parents, teachers, primary and secondary heads, and directors of education in the SNP government&rsquo;s handling of Scottish education; notes with concern the cuts in education provision across Scotland; calls on the First Minister to clarify the cost and timescale for delivery of his class-sizes pledge, made on 5 September 2007, when he promised the Parliament that his class-sizes pledge on primaries 1 to 3 would be met in the lifetime of this parliament; recognises the growing number of teachers coming to the end of their probationary year who are either unable to find a teaching post or who are forced into taking part-time or temporary employment; worries that if this trend is allowed to continue unchecked, it will undermine the internationally recognised success of the teacher induction scheme, and calls for immediate action from Scottish Ministers to address the impending jobs crisis. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2120.3</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Education Cuts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2120) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from first &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the potential for educational improvement for Scottish pupils offered by the local government settlement which delivered record levels of funding for local authorities and which Labour members voted for; recognises that the Concordat between local and national government is giving local authorities greater scope to improve educational outcomes by freeing them up from unnecessary bureaucracy, as well as giving them greater local accountability, and notes that the new single outcome agreements, which will be finalised shortly, will include specific local and national outcomes which, over time, will deliver real benefits for pupils in every local authority area in Scotland.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2120.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Education Cuts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2120) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;but condemns the decision of the Educational Institute for Scotland at its recent conference to ballot its members on industrial action, and believes that any strike action by teachers will be immensely damaging to educational provision in Scotland and to Scotland&rsquo;s school pupils.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2120.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Education Cuts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2120) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;welcomes the assessment from the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland that implementation of the SNP policy to cut class sizes to 18 in P1-P3 requires &pound;360 million of capital for additional classrooms and &pound;62 million of recurring revenue funding, and therefore calls on the First Minister to confirm to the Parliament whether his government believes that this is an accurate estimate and why.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Labour Party Debate: Bus Transport&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2121</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Bus Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes more effective implementation of regulatory arrangements is needed to improve the quality, affordability and accessibility of bus travel; considers that resources are needed by local authorities and regional transport partnerships to permit them to complete the action points in the Bus Action Plan, vital if more people are to be encouraged to use buses rather than cars; expresses concern about the sharp increase in fares throughout Scotland caused by increasing fuel prices and the SNP government&rsquo;s decision not to increase the Bus Services Operators Grant in line with the rebate provided by the UK Government to bus operators in England and Wales; calls on ministers to promote through-ticketing, to seek a review of the Competition Commission&rsquo;s stance on the level of communication that can occur between public transport operators on issues such as timetabling which would assist greater integration with other forms of public transport and to review penalty clauses in rail and ferry contracts which inhibit multi-modal travel; determines in principle, in the interests of inclusion and social justice, to extend eligibility for concessionary travel to people with learning disabilities and other disabled people in receipt of the lower rate of disability living allowance, and calls on Scottish Ministers not to defer this change until the completion of the three-year review of the National Concessionary Travel Scheme. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2121.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Bus Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2121) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &quot;considers&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that statutory quality partnerships and quality contracts introduced by the previous administration have failed to produce any meaningful results; notes in contrast that voluntary partnerships between bus operators and local authorities are flourishing and delivering an excellent service to passengers across Scotland; congratulates Perth-based Stagecoach and Aberdeen-based First Group on their unparalleled global success, achieved in the de-regulated bus environment; further congratulates Lothian Buses on being named the best bus company in the United Kingdom for 2007 and notes the success that this company has achieved since the de-regulation of municipal bus companies under the provisions of the Transport (Scotland) Act 1989; expresses concern about the sharp increase in fares throughout Scotland caused by increasing fuel prices and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to review the operation and funding of the Bus Services Operators Grant in consultation with the industry; calls on ministers to seek a review of the Competition Commission&rsquo;s stance on the level of communication that can occur between public transport operators on issues such as timetabling which would assist greater integration with other forms of public transport and to review penalty clauses in rail and ferry contracts that inhibit multi-modal travel; notes that Labour and Liberal Democrat ministers in the previous administration chose not to grant eligibility to people with learning disabilities and other disabled people in receipt of the lower rate of disability allowance when they created the National Concessionary Fares Scheme, and supports the review that may lead to improvements in the scheme as drawn up by Labour and Liberal Democrat ministers.&quot; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-2121.1.1</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Bus Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-2121.1) in the name of Alex Johnstone, insert at end &quot;notes that increasing fuel costs presents a significant opportunity for bus transport to demonstrate that it is an efficient and effective alternative for many car journeys, and condemns the failure of the Westminster government to respond to the sudden increases in the price of crude oil which are bringing uncertainty to a wide range of businesses and domestic users of oil and putting at risk the positive developments in the bus industry in recent years.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2121.3</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes: Bus Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2121) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;recognises that, in rural areas, buses are often the only alternative to car use and that rural areas therefore suffer disproportionately from bus fare increases or reduced bus services; considers that the review of the National Concessionary Travel Scheme should extend eligibility to older and disabled people using community transport in rural areas, and believes that the provision of efficient and affordable bus services must be supported with the necessary infrastructure on both local and trunk roads, including expanded park-and-ride schemes, bus passenger priority measures and accurate and accessible timetable information.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2121.2</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie: Bus Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2121) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;recognises the need, beyond the short term, to consider the most appropriate regulatory environment for bus services to operate within, given the mixed impacts of competition in the industry and the positive results that have been achieved in countries and cities which use stronger forms of bus regulation, and calls on the Scottish Government to consult on the full range of options for the future of bus services.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
