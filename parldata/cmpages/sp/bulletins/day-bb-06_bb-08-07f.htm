<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#fend">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4693</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Jet Skis and Dolphins in the Firth of Tay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the dolphin colony in the Firth of Tay has been subjected to harassment by some jet ski users; commends the efforts of Dundee City Council to address this problem; recognises that harassment of marine mammals and swimmers need not be taken as representative of the behaviour of jet ski users as a whole, and further notes that an E-petition on jet ski use is available for signing on the Parliament website until 25 August 2006 at http://epetitions.scottish.parliament.uk/view_petition.asp?PetitionID=98.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4692</strong> <strong>Mr Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>Air Route Development at Glasgow International Airport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the closure by American Airlines of its summer air route from Glasgow International Airport to Chicago, after 12 years of operation; is further concerned that Glasgow International Airport has, in recent years, lost direct routes to London City, Boston, Washington, Frankfurt/Munich, Stockholm and Brussels airports; is also concerned that previously withdrawn routes to Toronto and Prague have only been partially replaced; notes that seasonal routes such as the erstwhile Chicago route and the current Philadelphia route are not eligible for support under the current rules of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Air Route Development Fund, and calls on the Minister for Transport, Tavish Scott, and BAA Scotland to meet urgently to give, together, fresh impetus to route development and surface access to the airport by more flexible application of the Air Route Development Fund, expediting the completion of the M74 motorway and the Glasgow Airport Rail Link and by an irrevocable commitment to Glasgow Crossrail.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4691</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>University of Paisley</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal to change the name of University of Paisley which would completely remove any reference to Paisley; further notes that the proposed new name, the University of the West of Scotland, does not have a direct association with Paisley; appreciates the added value that a university brings to the status of each of Scotland&rsquo;s university towns and cities; believes that the university is a vital part of the culture and the future of Paisley; is concerned that changing the name in this way will undermine the good work done in building the reputation of the University of Paisley and will undermine the desire for city status, and calls on managers of the University of Paisley to open a consultation exercise to allow Paisley to be in the name of the new institution.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4690</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>The Lost Lives of the People of Qana</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled by the brutal deaths of 65 innocent women and children in the Lebanese village of Qana as a result of strikes by Israeli warplanes in the early hours of 30 July 2006; believes that had a ceasefire been negotiated two weeks earlier, as the United Nations and others had proposed, these lives would not have been lost, and further believes that those, such as the British Prime Minister, who oppose the widespread demand to cease hostilities stand condemned alongside those who killed the people at Qana.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4689</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Maternity Services in Aberdeenshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision of NHS Grampian to recommend to the Minister for Health and Community Care the closure of maternity units at Aboyne, Huntly, Fraserburgh and Banff; commends campaigners who have fought to retain these units on the positive way in which they have engaged in the board&rsquo;s consultation process on the issue; continues to agree that these units are an excellent example of health services being delivered locally as advocated by Professor David Kerr in his report, <em>Building a Health Service Fit for the Future</em>; further agrees that expectant mothers should have the option of giving birth locally, at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary or in the home, and calls on the Minister to reject the board&rsquo;s recommendation and retain these units to give expectant mothers a genuine choice.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4688#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Crossrail Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the progress that has been made to modernise Scotland&rsquo;s rail infrastructure, the most recent example of which was the agreement to the general principles of the Bill to establish the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) on 21 June 2006; notes the points contained in the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill Committee&rsquo;s preliminary stage report which highlight the national and local economic and transport benefits of the proposed Glasgow Crossrail scheme if introduced in conjunction with the GARL project; recognises the added value which the proposed crossrail scheme would bring not only to Glasgow but to Scotland&rsquo;s rail transport infrastructure; acknowledges that the establishment of the scheme would bridge the missing link in Scotland&rsquo;s rail network; realises that the scheme would further strengthen Glasgow&rsquo;s bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and believes that the compelling economic and transport case for Glasgow Crossrail is such that the Scottish Executive should commit to the implementation of the project.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4687</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>Prestwick Airport - Supply of Weapons to Israel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the compliance of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government in delivering to Israel munitions supplied by the United States of America; is very concerned that the weapons of mass destruction that have been allowed to pass through Prestwick Airport were subsequently used by Israel to bomb and kill innocent civilians in southern Lebanon; considers that UK Government compliance may well represent a breach of international law, in that it assisted Israel to carry out disproportionate attacks on Lebanon, and is further concerned that by allowing the use of Prestwick Airport to facilitate the supply of weaponry to Israel the UK Government may have increased the possibility that Scotland in general, and Ayrshire in particular, could become a target for reprisal attacks.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4686</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Trans-shipment of US Arms Through Scottish Airports</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses alarm regarding the Israeli military assault on Lebanon; conveys particular concern at the Foreign Office&rsquo;s weak response to the issue of the trans-shipment of US arms to Israel via Prestwick Airport; considers that the consignment of &quot;bunker busting&quot; bombs, which have already passed through Scotland, will likely be used against Lebanese targets, with the potential to injure innocent civilians; recognises findings which show that 61% of Britons do not support the nature of Israel&rsquo;s actions in Lebanon; suggests that the Scottish Executive should liaise with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to ensure the immediate cessation of such arms trans-shipments, and further requests that it expresses support for the demand for an immediate ceasefire as outlined by UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4685</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Corporate Social Responsibility of RBS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Group for its pledge to provide 50 new free-to-use cash machines in some of the poorest and most remote communities in Scotland, providing thousands of people with free access to their money; notes that RBS is already the largest provider of free-to-use cash machines in the United Kingdom and that the bank&rsquo;s newest initiative recognises the need for free cash machines, particularly in poorer communities; welcomes RBS&rsquo;s approach of providing the new bank machines through seeking advice on the location by asking the general public, local authorities, credit unions and community leaders, to ensure that the most appropriate communities in Scotland benefit, and believes that this action by RBS shows that one of Scotland&rsquo;s most successful corporations understands it has a social responsibility for all Scots and is another example of a profitable business applying corporate social responsibility.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4678.1</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Gay Police Association Advertisement</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4678) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;the use of&quot; to end and insert &quot;prejudice and discrimination, including that based on homophobia or religious intolerance; congratulates Scottish police forces for making significant progress in recent years to tackle prejudice within their own ranks and to improve public protection from hate crime; congratulates the Gay Police Association (GPA) in Scotland for its contribution to this progress and for raising public debate on the issue through its advertisement in the 29 June 2006 issue of <em>The Independent</em> newspaper; agrees with the GPA that religion can never be an excuse for homophobic hate crime and condemns those who attempt to use it as such; considers that the timing of the advert was particularly appropriate given that on the same day the Scottish Executive announced its rejection of the headline recommendation from its own working group on hate crime, and urges the Executive to reconsider this decision and ensure that victims of homophobic crimes in Scotland have the same legal protection as religious communities already enjoy.&quot;</p>
