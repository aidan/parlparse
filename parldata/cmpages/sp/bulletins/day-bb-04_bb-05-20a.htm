            skills and learning opportunities that will allow more people to play 
            a full and productive role in the workplace and in the community; 
            recognises the vital contribution that skills and learning make in 
            helping to stimulate sustainable economic growth and to close the 
            opportunity gap, and congratulates all those involved in the Modern 
            Apprenticeship programme, which has exceeded its target of having

                and hosting world-class events and festivals; recognises the great 
                benefits that events and festivals can bring throughout Scotland, 
                such as boosting our economy, promoting the international profile 
                of Scotland as a place to visit and in which to live, work and 
                invest and encouraging Scots, particularly young people, to participate 
                in sport and culture; welcomes the success achieved by EventScotland 
                in its first year of operation in realising the potential of Scotland 
                as a world-class destination for events, and congratulates the 
                many organisers of festivals throughout Scotland in their success 
                in getting communities involved in these festivals and attracting 
                visitors to Scotland. </P>

                national or area tourist boards or private or public bodies; notes 
                that the impediment to further success has been a shortage of 
                funds and that the creation of an additional and unnecessary tier 
                of bureaucracy is not the solution, and calls for the abolition
