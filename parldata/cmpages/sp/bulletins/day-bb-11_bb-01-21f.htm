<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>

<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
  <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7765 Elaine Smith: Breast is Best</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s new strategy to improve maternal and infant nutrition; recognises that the Scottish Government has adopted as its policy the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s guidance recommending exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of an infant&rsquo;s life; believes that the benefits of breastfeeding are well documented for both mother and child and that breast milk provides babies with the essential nutrients that they need for healthy development and contains antibodies that help protect from common childhood illnesses; is concerned that there has been negative publicity surrounding a recent report in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> questioning the best time to introduce solid foods into a baby&rsquo;s diet; understands that Baby Milk Action states on its website that three of the authors of the report in question receive funding from the baby food industry; therefore welcomes the new advertising campaign to promote the benefits of breastfeeding, and urges NHS Lanarkshire to develop a fresh action plan to take forward the implementation of the strategy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7764 Charlie Gordon: Fight to Retain BMI&rsquo;s Glasgow/Heathrow Air Link</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regards the threatened reduction in the frequency, or complete withdrawal, of BMI&rsquo;s air service between Glasgow International and London Heathrow airports as a potentially serious blow to the Scottish economy; notes that the catalyst for doubts over the service&rsquo;s future is the proposed increase in landing charges from April 2011 that has been made by Heathrow&rsquo;s owners, BAA, of around &pound;10 per passenger; further notes BMI&rsquo;s intention to lodge a formal complaint under section 41 of the Airports Act 1986 regarding this; calls on the Scottish Government to add its weight to the efforts of other stakeholders to bolster the service, and calls on BAA to agree to impose a moratorium on its proposed increase in landing charges.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7763 John Scott: Potential Disadvantage for Scottish Egg Producers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that EU animal welfare legislation introducing a ban on the use of conventional cages for laying hens might not be enforced equally across the EU member states from 1 January 2012; believes that this will be disadvantageous to the Scottish and British egg industries, which it understands have already incurred significant costs in meeting the requirements of the legislation by investing in enriched cages or non-cage systems of egg production; notes that the United Kingdom is already the largest free-range egg producer in the EU; further notes that eggs produced to a lower animal welfare standard are cheaper to produce and might be allowed access to Scottish and British markets post-2012, and is of the view that, once again, Scottish and UK farmers will be put at a competitive disadvantage by producing eggs to the highest EU-agreed animal welfare standards while farmers in other member states are unlikely to be able to meet the deadline and that they might be allowed additional time to phase out the use of conventional cages post-2012.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7762 John Wilson: Insecticide Hazard to Bees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the report by the <em>Independent</em> newspaper on 20 January 2011 that raises the potential that honeybee colonies in Britain are being poisoned by the use of neonicotinoid insecticides; further notes that this discovery follows on from research conducted in the US Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Bee Research Laboratory that found that neonicotinoid insecticides may be causing colony collapse disorder throughout the world; acknowledges that more than 1.4 million acres were reported to have been treated with these insecticides in 2008, and calls on the UK and Scottish governments to suspend the use of these chemical compounds as a precautionary measure to allow for further clarity to be sought on their effects.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7761 Mr Frank McAveety: East End Community Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all of the winners of the <em>Evening Times</em> Community Champions awards; welcomes the senior award win for Margaret Miller, who founded the Lightburn WRVS Harmony Club in Shettleston; recognises that the club has offered help to stroke patients for more than 35 years; recognises the value that local champions bring to their area, and welcomes the celebration of these community champions who, it considers, have worked tirelessly to help the people of the east end and the whole city.</p>
<p>Supported by: Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7760 Joe FitzPatrick: 30th Anniversary of the Twinning of Nablus and Dundee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 30th anniversary of the twinning of Nablus in Palestine and Dundee; congratulates Fraser Patrick, the convener of the Dundee Nablus Twinning Association, and the Palestinian students, Rami Issa and Rafiq Zein Eddin, who have been working with the twinning association to stage events commemorating the 30th anniversary of the link with the West Bank city, and considers that those involved in the anniversary celebrations have been actively strengthening the ties between Dundee and Nablus and continuing the tradition of friendship and understanding between the people of Nablus and the people of Dundee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7759 Jackson Carlaw: Proposed Waste Incineration Plant at Loganswell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern in respect of the proposal to establish a waste incineration plant at Loganswell near Newton Mearns in  Eastwood covering some 29 hectares and which is anticipated to burn some 1.5 million tonnes of raw waste a year, a proposal which would arguably turn Eastwood into the ashtray of the west of Scotland; further notes the evidence of Duncan McLaren of Friends of the Earth Scotland who advised the Transport Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee on 23 November 2010 that it &quot;would be insane to build Europe&rsquo;s largest incinerator in East Renfrewshire&quot;; believes that an urgent rethink of this project is essential, and urges the Scottish Government to demonstrate its support for the wider local community, which it considers is resolutely opposed to this proposed development.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7758 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Scotland&rsquo;s Michelin Stars</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the top-rated Scottish restaurants that have retained their Michelin stars in the latest edition of the world-renowned food guide; believes that The Kitchin, Restaurant Martin Wishart and Plumed Horse all fly the flag for quality cuisine in Leith and Edinburgh; notes that the Michelin star awards are recognised worldwide, and believes that such recognition brings with it important business, economic and tourism opportunities for the city.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7757 Brian Adam: Listen to Supporters&rsquo; Views on the Future of the SPL</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the ongoing discussions in the Scottish Premier League (SPL) regarding the future structure of the league; regrets the apparent rush toward a decision before supporters have had the chance to look at and scrutinise the proposals; notes the Supporters Direct survey in which nearly nine out of 10 supporters opposed a 10-team league; believes that, as the paying customers of the SPL, supporters&rsquo; views should be taken onboard, and calls on the SPL and individual clubs to consult fans before a final decision is made.</p>
