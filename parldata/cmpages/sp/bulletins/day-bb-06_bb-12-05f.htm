<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;
  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5269</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Civic Participation - Trade Union Engagement with Scotland&rsquo;s Civic Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the strength and constructive nature of its partnership with civic Scotland; recalls that this began in the Constitutional Convention when a wide range of civic organisations, including trade unions, came together with the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties to develop the blueprint for devolution; notes that this partnership is evolving as the Parliament and civic society work together to achieve social justice, and acknowledges the importance of the Executive working in partnership with organisations such as the Scottish Trades Union Congress, other non-governmental organisations and civic partners in Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5268</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>The Renewal of Trident</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision to renew Trident at a cost of up to &pound;76 billion; recognises that this is an obscene waste of money and will not make Scotland any safer; condemns the First Minister and the Labour Party in Scotland for their failure to stand up for the interests of the people of Scotland, the majority of whom oppose these weapons of mass destruction, and recognises that only an independent nuclear-free Scotland can make us safe.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5267</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Funders&rsquo; Forum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the first Scotland Funders&rsquo; Forum conference; congratulates its members, which include lottery distributors, independent grant-making trusts, Scottish Executive departments and COSLA, on the development of a common evaluation framework, to be unveiled at the conference, which aims to improve consistency and provide an effective approach to evaluation and learning by funders; recognises the importance of collaboration among funders to reduce bureaucracy by lessening the burden on voluntary organisations of repeated and differing requests from each of their funders for information, in different forms and on different dates, by replacing these with a more coherent, focussed and uniform system of scrutiny and reporting, agreed by funding and recipient organisations, to work towards continuous improvement and to increase the capacity of funders and applicants to achieve measurable progress; supports the Scotland Funders&rsquo; Forum in its efforts to improve the appetite for taking managed risks to meet unmet need and to look ahead to opportunities to broker new and different approaches to providing services for communities, and commends the forum for its commitment to achieving improved outcomes for communities in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5266</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Hugo Chavez</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hugo Chavez on his magnificent victory in the presidential elections in Venezuela; believes that this is an endorsement of his Bolivarian road to socialism and a rejection of the neoliberal approach of Bush and Blair, and further recognises that this is part of a movement to the left throughout Latin America.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5265</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>North East Scotland Credit Union Farepak Offer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates North East Scotland Credit Union (NESCU) on its announcement that is willing to provide low-cost loans to everyone in Grampian who has lost money with Farepak; notes that, as with every loan it issues, NESCU will provide free life insurance to cover the loan and that it will waive its usual joining fee, required of all credit union customers, in the case of Farepak families; believes that this is a generous gesture which demonstrates the important role that credit unions can play in helping families affected by events like the Farepak collapse; urges families throughout Grampian and Scotland which have lost money with Farepak to use credit unions rather than alternative forms of moneylending, and hopes that credit unions throughout Scotland will follow NESCU&rsquo;s lead and offer assistance to families affected by Farepak&rsquo;s collapse.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5264</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure or increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in Rule 9.12.3(b)(ii) or (iii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5263&diams; </strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle:</strong> <strong>Towards a Litter-Free Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the work carried out by various agencies involved in the collection of litter from our roads, railway verges, streets, shores and parks; supports initiatives that will reduce the unnecessary expense of employing people to collect litter, and accepts that, despite the incredible efforts of volunteers in removing litter, more than &pound;3 million is spent annually on this non-productive exercise but congratulates the voluntary groups in Fife, Perth, Stirling and Clackmannan for the work they have already carried out.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5262</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to President Chavez on his Re-Election</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hugo Chavez on his re-election as President of Venezuela with a majority, over 60%, of votes on a high turnout; believes that this is a massive vote of confidence by the Venezuelan electors in President Chavez and his &quot;Bolivarian revolution&quot; which consists of a wide-ranging programme of social reforms in health, education and community welfare projects, financed by the revenues from the country&rsquo;s state-owned oil resources; believes that this result demonstrates the empowerment of communities, women and indigenous populations through the political course steered by President Chavez and vindicates the strategy of building a bulwark of popular regimes, such as Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua, on the Latin American continent which now have socialist or left-leaning governments, and hopes that these regimes will build a powerful force for revolutionary change there and send a signal to the US administration that its interference is not welcome in Latin America.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5261&diams; </strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Success of Scots Trad Music Awards 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hands Up For Trad, its founder Simon Toumire of Footstompin&rsquo; Records and the sponsors and supporters who made the 2006 awards ceremony and weekend entertainment in Fort William such a happy and successful gathering; draws particular attention to the staff of the Nevis Centre whose hard work allowed the annual event to move from its Edinburgh base and offer a top-class venue, a friendly Highland welcome and a tremendous warm-up for the major events to be staged there in 2007 during the Scottish Year of Highland Culture; offers congratulations to winners of a wide range of awards, voted on by thousands across the globe, that give significant recognition to the excellence within Scotland&rsquo;s thriving contemporary traditional music scene; encourages the funding bodies to invest in this success which promotes, through composition, performance and enthusiastic audience response, such a positive message about Scottish cultural confidence, and believes that Scotland&rsquo;s television media should build on BBC Radio Scotland&rsquo;s role as the sole consistent champion of our Scottish music and traditions by broadcasting the images and sounds round the world.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5260</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Fife&rsquo;s World Scotch Pie Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Keith Stuart of Stuart&rsquo;s the Bakers in Buckhaven on being crowned world champion at the recent World Scotch Pie Championships 2007; notes that this family business will celebrate its 150th anniversary in October 2007; further notes that the company is now part of the flagship redevelopment and regeneration of Methil docks area from which its state-of-the-art bakery building serves its network of local shops; recognises that this award will be beneficial to the future prospects of the company, giving greater security to the 170 local people employed in the bakery and shops;  commends the company and its staff for the work they do to raise funds for the Scottish Society for Autism; welcomes the first ever National Scotch Pie Week in which 250 shops all over Scotland have participated, and believes that the tradition of good food, prepared using the best Scottish ingredients, is the secret of the success of Stuart&rsquo;s, the family bakers and butchers of Buckhaven, and of many other Scottish food businesses.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5259</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>End of Term Report on Multiple Sclerosis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the <em>End of Term Report on Multiple Sclerosis, </em>published by the Multiple Sclerosis Society; notes with concern that, with around 10,400 people diagnosed, Scotland has the highest prevalence of MS in the world; appreciates that, while some improvements have been made to the care and treatment of MS with drugs such as beta interferon and glatiramer now being generally available on the NHS, much more still needs to be done; is concerned at the slow progress of the development and implementation of standards of care for people affected by neurological conditions, a proposal for which was approved on 2 February 2006; is further concerned that, although there are now 23 MS nurses in Scotland, they have required to be jointly funded by charitable donations rather than through central funding and that there is still considerable inequality of access to such nurses with Lanarkshire, for example, having only one nurse for 1,100 patients; is deeply concerned that the social care framework for people with MS is severely limited due to local authority budget constraints, with services such as respite care not being adequately and appropriately delivered in some areas and the Multiple Sclerosis Society being required to pick up the shortfall to the tune of &pound;700,000 annually, and home adaptations not being available free of charge to patients in all local authority areas, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide adequate resources to the NHS and local authorities to ensure equal access to care and services to all MS patients, regardless of where they live.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5258</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>Council Tax</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recommendations of the Independent Local Government Finance Review Committee report but opposes its central recommendation of a &quot;local property tax&quot;; agrees that the 60% increase in council tax levels since Labour came to power has left those on low incomes struggling to pay their council tax bills, especially our pensioner households, and therefore calls for a 50% discount on council tax for all pensioner households aged 65 and over in Scotland, as proposed by the Scottish Conservatives.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5257</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Clydesdale - Best Bank for Business</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its congratulations to Clydesdale Bank on being named the best bank in Scotland for business customers by the Forum of Private Business and trusts that the other banks in Scotland will continue, with the Clydesdale, to develop strong banking and support networks for Scottish businesses and continue to bolster Scotland&rsquo;s international reputation for financial services that reward clients, no matter where they are based.</p>
