<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3729</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Allow Expatriates Scottish Voting Rights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recommendation by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) calling for UK expatriates to be given the right to vote in devolved elections; notes that UK citizens living abroad are able to vote in UK general and European Parliament elections but are not entitled to vote in local council or devolved parliament elections; further notes the IPPR&rsquo;s findings in 2006 that around 5.5 million UK citizens lived outside Britain; agrees with the IPPR that the freedom to vote would provide Scottish migrants with a way of maintaining a positive link with Scotland and encourage their remigration in the future; hails the Homecoming Scotland 2009 events, which are making efforts to engage with the diaspora of Scots living abroad, and finally calls on the UK Government to transfer the control of Scottish Parliament elections to Scotland so that Scottish expatriates will be given the opportunity to have a say in their country&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3728</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Science in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategic framework for science, <em>Science for Scotland,</em> on 27 November 2008; agrees with its vision for Scotland as a nation of world-class scientific achievement, a magnet for talent and for investment and a powerhouse of technology, innovation, enterprise and increasing sustainable economic growth; supports the strong message that <em>Science for Scotland</em> sends out to Scotland and the world about this vision; agrees that maintaining a strong science base in Scotland is vital because it will underpin economic growth, help improve public services, enhance quality of life and help solve the world&rsquo;s most pressing problems; notes the detailed ambitions and commitments made around the five themes of <em>Science for Scotland</em> about developing individuals, scientific research, economic and business demand, international profile and connections in Scotland and government; further notes that <em>Science for Scotland </em>calls to action many bodies and sectors of the economy and asks them to work with the Scottish Government to help progress the aspirations of <em>Science for Scotland, </em>and asks the Scottish Government to monitor and report to the Parliament on the progress being made.</p>
<p>Supported by: Keith Brown<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3727</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Forestry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the unanimous recommendation of the Rural and Environment Committee that the Scottish Government drop proposals for leasing up to 25% of the Forestry Commission&nbsp;estate for a period of 75 years;&nbsp;welcomes the decision of the Scottish Government to amend the Climate Change Bill to remove the relevant clauses,&nbsp;and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward its review of the operation of the Scotland Rural Development Programme urgently, including reviewing the level awarded for grants, and to pursue proposals for joint ventures to deliver renewables projects in the Forestry Commission estate.</p>
<p>Supported by: Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3726</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Police Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Scottish Government must ensure that there are 17,265 full-time equivalent police officers by March 2011, calculated on the basis currently used by the Chief Statistician in the reporting of the official Police Officer Quarterly Strength Statistics, for the SNP&rsquo;s stated manifesto pledge for 1,000 more police officers to be met.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3725</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Committee Remit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the remit of the Local Government and Communities Committee be amended to&mdash;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3716</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>40th Anniversary of the Loss of the Longhope Lifeboat</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 17 March 2009 marks the 40th anniversary of the capsizing of the Longhope lifeboat<em>,</em> the TGB, in the Pentland Firth with the loss of its crew of eight who together left behind seven widows and 10 fatherless children; further notes that, despite this incredible blow to the small community at Longhope, the lifeboat station remains active to this day with the crew of the current Tamar class lifeboat, the Helen Comrie, continuing the long tradition of seamanship and bravery displayed since the station was first established in 1874; believes that, as one of the smallest communities to support and crew a lifeboat, the Longhope community reflects the highest traditions and values of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), and recognises that, thanks to the service of the crews of the Longhope lifeboats for well over a century, including that of the crew tragically lost in 1969, mariners passing through the Pentland Firth can do so in the confidence that the Longhope lifeboat remains on station ready to come to their aid when required.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3715</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>World Social Work Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament joins with social workers across Scotland in celebrating World Social Work Day on 17 March 2009; notes the enormous contribution that Scotland&rsquo;s social workers and social care workers make to improving the lives of individuals, families and communities across Scotland; recognises that social work services benefit all sections of the community and are likely to touch every one of us at some point in our lives; acknowledges that, despite the difficult environment that many of them work in, social workers and social care workers successfully work with other services to help people find solutions to their own problems, and finally applauds the value and contribution that this workforce makes to Scotland every day.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3698 *#*</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Anne Frank Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 12 June 2009 is Anne Frank Day, the 80th anniversary of the birth of Anne Frank; welcomes the establishment in 2008 of Anne Frank Scotland as the new education programme for the Anne Frank Trust UK; further welcomes the work carried out by Anne Frank Scotland with young people to develop an understanding of positive citizenship and human rights; further notes that the programme is focussed on Glasgow, Edinburgh and Fife and supports the expansion of the programme across the whole of Scotland; looks forward to the opportunity for the Parliament to host the travelling exhibition, Anne Frank: A History for Today, which is the centrepiece of the programme; understands that the exhibition uses Anne Frank&rsquo;s story and the history of the Holocaust to address contemporary challenges and discrimination in Scotland, and hopes that all MSPs sign up to the Anne Frank Declaration to mark this anniversary as a recognition of the millions of children and young people who have been victims of persecution and to challenge the prejudice and hatred that harms us all.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3684</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant:</strong> <strong>Rejection for Proposals for a Separate Quota Management and Licensing System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament rejects the SNP government&rsquo;s proposals for a separate quota management and licensing system, which are potentially damaging to the fishing industry; believes that the proposals create new bureaucracy for fishermen; calls on the Scottish Government to publish any legal advice that it has taken on the competence of the proposals; urges the Scottish Government to take a coordinated approach with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government and the devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland to develop a marine strategy for the benefit of the fishing industry and marine conservation, and calls on the Scottish Government to encourage cooperation across all sectors, including local fishing communities, to enable them to work to develop regional fisheries management and also work with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to ensure reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to enable the devolution of decision making to regional management structures.</p>
