<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p>9.15 am Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Labour Party Business: Transport</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-8177 Charlie Gordon: Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that market failure in the bus industry requires legislation to regulate bus services in the best interests of the travelling public. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-8177.1 Keith Brown: Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8177) in the name of Charlie Gordon, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the Labour proposals for regulation of bus services; recognises the important role that bus services provide to communities across Scotland; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s investment of almost &pound;250 million in the bus network, including funding for the national concessionary travel scheme, the Bus Service Operators Grant, which supports the bus network, investment of &pound;4.4 million in the Scottish Green Bus Fund and over &pound;500,000 in retrofitting particulate traps in buses that help reduce costs, and calls for more practical support for passengers and bus companies including the introduction of a fuel duty regulator, as agreed by the Parliament on 2 March 2011, which would be of genuine help to bus users, reducing costs, unlike Labour proposals on VAT, which can be reclaimed and would make no difference to bus companies or users.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-8177.3 Jackson Carlaw: Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8177) in the name of Charlie Gordon, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that voluntary partnerships between bus operators and local authorities have proved a successful means of delivering quality bus services in many areas of Scotland; congratulates Perth-based Stagecoach and Aberdeen-based FirstGroup on their unparalleled global success; further congratulates Lothian Buses on being named the best bus company in the UK for 2007 and notes the success that this company has achieved since the Transport (Scotland) Act 1989; therefore, in light of the clear evidence, cautions against the inappropriate regulation of bus services, and urges local authorities concerned about services in their area to examine those voluntary partnerships operating outside the statutory framework that have delivered most in terms of results and to consider what lessons can be learned and applied.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-8177.2 Alison McInnes: Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8177) in the name of Charlie Gordon, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the importance of efficient and accessible bus services at a time of high fuel costs and changing travel patterns; welcomes the positive developments in the bus industry in recent years, but believes that more progress can be made in improving access to bus services, encouraging modal shift and reducing congestion; believes that the provision of efficient and affordable bus services must be supported with the necessary infrastructure on both local and trunk roads, including expanded park-and-ride schemes, bus passenger priority measures and accurate and accessible timetable information; supports community transport and demand-responsive transport schemes in areas where public transport availability is limited, and supports the restoration of the Bus Route Development Scheme to aid the development of new and existing registered local bus services that have the potential for growth.&quot; </p>

  <p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-7853 Mary Scanlon: Chronic Pain Services in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that some Scottish patients with chronic pain are being forced to travel to England for treatment, with eight of Scotland&rsquo;s NHS boards sending patients with chronic pain for treatment at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath at a cost of &pound;206,685 in the first six months of 2010-11; understands that since 2008-09 it has cost the NHS over &pound;620,000 to send patients to one hospital in Bath for treatment for chronic pain; understands the difficulties that this extra travel will cause for patients in terms of their own pain through travelling long distances, particularly from the north of Scotland, and also being separated from friends and families, and acknowledges the plight of people with chronic pain in Scotland, where the service across NHS boards is very patchy. </p>
