          <p>The Presiding Officer wishes to announce that subject to the Parliament&#146;s 
            approval of Business Motion S1M-2850 set out below, today&#146;s Business 
            will be as follows:</p>

            <p><strong>S1M-2833</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> 
              <strong>Scotch Whisky Industry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
              notes the publication of A Toast to the Future &#150; working together 
              for Scotch Whisky and the Scottish Executive&#146;s pledge to &quot;support 
              Scottish manufacturers where EU and UK policies have an effect on 
              the competitiveness of Scottish Industry&quot; and &quot;take steps 
              to ensure that the regulatory burden is kept to a sensible minimum&quot;; 
              further notes that Her Majesty&#146;s Government is considering 
              applying tax stamps throughout the UK, a measure described by the 
              Scotch Whisky Association as being &quot;by far the greatest threat 
              that the industry currently faces&quot;, and calls upon the Executive 
              to demonstrate its stated commitment to the industry, to implement 
              its stated pledge and, accordingly, to make representations to Her 
              Majesty's Government against the introduction of tax stamps. </p>
            <dir> 
              <dir> 
                <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
                <p><strong>S1M-2833.2</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Scotch 
                  Whisky Industry</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-2833) 
                  in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; 
                  to end and insert &quot;welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
                  recognition of the importance of the Scotch whisky industry 
                  to the economy, the contribution that the industry makes to 
                  employment across Scotland and the Executive&#146;s commitment 
                  to work with the industry as set out in A Toast to the Future 
                  &#150; working together for Scotch Whisky.&quot; </p>
                <p> <strong>S1M-2833.1</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Scotch Whisky 
                  Industry</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-2833) 
                  in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, insert at end "welcomes 
                  the raising by the Scottish Conservatives of an issue that is 
                  reserved; believes that the taxation imposed on whisky by successive 
                  UK governments has disadvantaged Scotch in the home market, 
                  where whisky is taxed at higher levels than wine or beer, and 
                  has also allowed other countries to seek to justify their own 
                  discriminatory tax regimes by reference to those in the UK; 
                  further believes that a tax stamp system would constitute a 
                  barrier to trade, would be inefficient and ineffective as a 
                  means of combating fraud and illicit trade, will cause many 
                  practical and technical problems in respect of, for example, 
                  labelling and storage and will impose substantial costs on the 
                  industry, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to demand that 
                  all powers relating to the regulation and taxation of the whisky 
                  industry be transferred to the Scottish Parliament. </p>

            </dir>
            <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Debate on Community Care&#151; </p>
            <p><strong>S1M-2839</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Community 
              Care</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the unequal funding 
              support between local authority and independently run care homes; 
              regrets the exceptionally high levels of delayed discharge within 
              Scotland&#146;s hospitals; believes that the action plan to tackle 
              delayed discharge will not solve the problem until health and social 
              work budgets are unified, and urges the Scottish Executive to implement 
              the recommendation of the Royal Commission chaired by Sir Stewart 
              Sutherland to unify these budgets within a single organisation and 
              put in place systems to ensure that funds allocated for community 
              care are actually spent on such services. </p>

              <dir> 
                <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
                <p><strong>S1M-2839.1</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: Community 
                  Care</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-2839) in the 
                  name of Mary Scanlon, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end 
                  and insert &quot;acknowledges the progress that is being made 
                  towards joint resourcing and joint management of older people&#146;s 
                  services; looks forward to further developments in the Joint 
                  Future agenda; welcomes the provision of significant extra resources 
                  for dealing with the problems of delayed discharge and care 
                  home fees, and recognises that such resources are part of the 
                  biggest ever investment in care services for older people.&quot;

            <p>3.30 pm&#9;Debate on the Homelessness Task Force&#151; </p>
            <p><strong>S1M-2838</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong> <strong>Final 
              Report of the Homelessness Task Force</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
              welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s commitment to preventing 
              and alleviating homelessness in Scotland and endorses the Executive&#146;s 
              pledge to implement the wide-ranging recommendations contained in 
              the final report of the Homelessness Task Force, Helping Homeless People: An Action Plan for Prevention and Effective Response. </p>
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-2838.2</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Final Report 
              of the Homelessness Task Force</strong>&#151;As an amendment to 
              motion (S1M-2838) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
              to end and insert &quot;notes the final report of the Homelessness 
              Task Force, Helping Homeless People: An Action Plan for Prevention 
              and Effective Response; regrets that, five years after the election 
              of New Labour, homelessness in Scotland is higher than when they 
              took office; seeks a commitment from the Scottish Executive to produce 
              an action plan for implementation of the 59 recommendations within 
              six months; believes that, for homelessness to be eradicated, the 
              recommendations in the report must be fully resourced, and acknowledges 
              than an independent Scotland, with full control over the benefits 
              system, would be much better placed to tackle homelessness than 
              an Executive dependent on the decisions and goodwill of Westminster.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> <strong>S1M-2838.1</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Final Report 
              of the Homelessness Task Force</strong>&#151;As an amendment to 
              motion (S1M-2838) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
              to end and insert &quot;notes the publication of the final report 
              of the Homelessness Task Force, Helping Homeless People: An Action 
              Plan for Prevention and Effective Response, two and a half years 
              after its inception; condemns the fact that homelessness applications 
              to local authorities have reached record levels during that period, 
              under the Scottish Executive, and remain close to that level; notes 
              with concern the Executive&#146;s decision to accept the task force&#146;s 
              recommendations in full without prior debate, particularly the proposals 
              to phase out the category of priority need and to remove the local 
              connection requirements, and calls on the Executive to take a less 
              prescriptive approach and allow local authorities the flexibility 
              they require in order to address the individual needs of homeless 
              people in their areas. </p>

              notes that a main cause is the decline of heavy industry in the

              and believes that the Scottish Executive should provide resources 
              for its speedy completion. </p>
