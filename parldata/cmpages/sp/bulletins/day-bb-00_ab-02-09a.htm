            common interest between separate taskforces and Executive departments are properly

          Parliament should consider supplementing financial resources provided to local authorities
          by the Home Office in relation to the Act&#146;s provisions and that the timetable for the
          Act&#146;s implementation in Scotland should be extended to April 2001 to allow time to
