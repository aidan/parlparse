            <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Sir James Shand</strong>—That the Parliament expresses 
            its regret and sadness following the recent death of Sir Jimmy Shand 
            at the age of 92; records its thanks for his outstanding and unique 
            contribution to the promotion of Scottish dance music since his first 
            recording in 1933; notes that he was recognised as an outstanding 
            exponent of Scottish accordion music throughout the world; commends 
            his sterling work in maintaining and reviving interest in this important 
            aspect of Scottish culture against fierce competition from new forms 
            of contemporary music from the 1950s throughout to the 1990s and offers 
            its sympathy and condolences to his wife and family and his many friends.</font></p>

            Blindcraft in Springburn on its remarkable achievement of clearing 
            almost £2 million in debt, on its hopes for breaking even this year, 
            on its increasing success in winning orders and on its plans to recruit 
            34 new employees; notes that Blindcraft currently has a workforce 
            of 148 of whom 90 have disabilities such as blindness, deafness, learning 
            difficulties or paralysis; commends the positive role Glasgow City

            and commitment of the workforce; wishes Blindcraft every success in 
            its plans to improve the training and numerical skills of its staff

            <strong>Euan Robson: Scottish Borders Labour Force</strong>—That the Parliament 
            notes the recent studies which have shown that a skills shortage is 
            likely to develop in the labour force in the Scottish Borders in the 
            next few years, creating particular challenges for traditional industries 
            such as textiles and also for the construction industry, and therefore 
            urges all relevant agencies to develop plans for training, retraining 
            and upskilling, which will also assist in attracting high technology 
            inward investors to broaden the base of the Borders’ economy and in 
            expanding attractive job opportunities for young people near their 
            home localities.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Snowmen</strong>—That the Parliament agrees with 
            Raymond Briggs, author of the book <i>The Snowman</i>, that it is 
            absolute rubbish to suggest that snowmen are racist and sexist; believes 
            that the paper produced by Dr Tricia Cusack claiming that the snow 
            sculptures are phallic symbols which help oppress women and represent 
            greed, nationalism and capitalism is so out of touch with the innocence 
            and joy experienced by children of all ages who build snowmen; further 
            believes that such a publication is not worthy of academic endorsement, 
            and calls upon children throughout Scotland to build as many snowmen 
            as possible as a message of solidarity to Raymond Briggs.</font></p>

            the Parliament recognises the supreme bravery displayed by the pipers 
            of the Highland regiments during the First World War and that they 
            inspired Scottish troops into battle on behalf of our country, and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to consider what action can be taken 
            to erect a suitable and lasting national memorial as a mark of respect 
            to the many hundreds of pipers who gallantly led from the front and 
            were often wounded or killed in battle.</font></p>

            their campaign to save the spire at the Townhead Church in Royston, 
            Glasgow following the award of a £329,000 grant from the Heritage

            on setting up an independent review of the appeals process for the 
            2000 diet of school examinations, and calls upon the Minister to ensure 
            the return of examination scripts to the schools of those candidates 
            who still have concerns about their appeals in order to further restore

            notes that water and sewerage charges have increased by 236% in the 
            last four years whereas the increase in state benefits for the same 
            period is less than 10%; believes that the proposed transitional scheme 
            will not assist those on low incomes who are currently unable to meet 
            these charges, and urges the Scottish Executive to pursue a Water 
            Service Benefit Scheme aligned to the current Council Tax Benefit 
            Scheme.</font></p>

            creameries in Campbeltown, Arran and Rothesay; recognises that the 
            £2.1 million cost of compliance with the Urban Waste Water Directive 
            is placing an intolerable burden on the creameries; expresses profound 
            concern at the attitude of the Scottish Executive in meeting only 
            a fraction of the compliance costs; considers that Scottish Milk, 
            the producers, the enterprise agencies and the Scottish Executive 
            should all work together to put together proposals for saving these 
            vital industries from closure, and asks the Minister for Rural Development 
            to make a Ministerial Statement to the Parliament as a matter of urgency.</font></p>

            supporters’ organisations for Morton fans to &quot;dig deep&quot; 
            into their own pockets for a fighting fund and to turn out in force 
            at all home games in order to maximise income now that official owner

            club; welcomes the decision of Morton legend Allan McGraw to accept

            or collection of individuals, with a genuine interest in the future 
            of Greenock Morton to step forward, purchase the club, and, working 
            in close conjunction with the fans and the people of Inverclyde, ensure

            the Parliament, in order to safeguard both the independence and effectiveness 
            of its Committees, believes that the structure, number and size of 
            those Committees should become the responsibility of a Committee specially 
            established for that purpose with the following provisos: that the 
            non-voting Convenor of the Committee should be the Presiding Officer 
            or his Deputy; that the Committee should comprise the four business 
            managers, two Committee Convenors (one each from an Executive and 
            Opposition party, nominated by the Committee of Convenors) and four 
            MSPs (each nominated by members of no less than three parliamentary 
            parties or groups and elected by all MSPs who are not members of the 
            Scottish Executive); that each member of the Committee should have 
            one vote, and that the Committee shall only bring proposals before 
            the Chamber if they are supported by seven out of ten members of the

            Ailsa Troon shipyard, which has failed to pay 16 shipyard workers 
            redundancy payments totalling some £300,000 due to them under the 
            terms of their contracts; further notes that these workers had demonstrated 
            their loyalty to the yard by remaining to complete an order after 
            the other workers had been laid off by Cathelco, and urges the suspension 
            of the award of any further government contracts to Cathelco companies 
            until such a time as Cathelco honours its commitment to all its staff.</font></p>
