          <p><strong>*S1M-2941</strong> <strong>Mike Watson: Debate on Tourism</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the progress that has been made by the Scottish 
            Executive in implementing <em>A New Strategy for Scottish Tourism</em> 
            since its publication in 2000 and commends the <em>Tourism Framework 
            for Action 2002-05</em> as the way to build on this and achieve a tourism 
            industry that is internationally competitive and which creates jobs 
            and wealth for the people of Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dr Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2940</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson: Size of the 
            Scottish Parliament</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government&#146;s consultation paper on the size of the Scottish Parliament; 
            acknowledges the positive progress made by the Parliament and its 
            committees, and considers that the number of elected representatives 
            should remain at 129.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2939</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: Inverness 
            and the Highlands&#146; Bid to be the European Capital of Culture 
            2008</strong>&#151;That the Parliament wholeheartedly endorses Inverness 
            and the Highlands&#146; bid to become the European Capital of Culture 
            2008 as Scotland&#146;s only contender for the event; recognises the 
            significant economic benefits that a successful bid could bring to 
            the city, the rest of the Highlands and Scotland as a whole, including 
            its potential to create a major increase in tourist spending and new 
            temporary and permanent jobs; notes Inverness&#146;s recently awarded 
            city status; urges organisations and individuals throughout the Highlands 
            to submit ideas and suggestions to Invernesshighland2008 to support 
            and strengthen the bid; welcomes the £100,000 contributions each from 
            the Scottish Executive, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Highland 
            Council to the campaign, and urges the Scottish Executive to continue 
            its active support for the bid.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2938</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Naval Defence 
            Review and Faslane and Coulport Naval Dockyards</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with regret the announcement by Geoff Hoon MP, 
            Secretary of State for Defence, of the outcome of the naval defence 
            review and his failure to give adequate consideration to representations 
            from trade unions and elected parliamentarians; recognises that the 
            trade unions, whose agreement to changes in conditions at the Faslane 
            and Coulport naval dockyards in previous years has been hailed as 
            a model in industrial relations, proposed further in-house efficiencies 
            and proposed "through life" maintenance plans which would team the 
            repair yards with the companies that build Royal Navy ships in long 
            term maintenance deals but would appear now to have been rejected; 
            further notes that in addition to the privatisation of cleaning, catering 
            and maintenance staff, there will be the possibility of redundancies 
            across the UK with a significant proportion of these anticipated at 
            the Faslane and Coulport dockyards; further recognises that this level 
            of job loss will have a critical effect on the local economy as well 
            as a significant negative impact on the individual employees and their 
            families, the majority of which reside in the Dumbarton parliamentary 
            constituency where employment at the dockyards accounts for approximately 
            one quarter of the full-time employment in the area; is concerned 
            that the area already has one of the highest levels of unemployment 
            in Scotland and that the scale of the job loss will be devastating, 
            and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to take action to mitigate 
            these job losses by providing significant additional financial support 
            for the re-training and re-skilling of those affected, to work closely 
            with the Ministry of Defence to maximise redeployment and to establish 
            a job creation programme for the area and to consider extending the 
            Clyde Corridor initiative to include all areas from Bowling, through 
            Dumbarton and up to Garelochhead in order to assist in the economic 
            regeneration of the area.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2937</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: The Draft 
            Bus User Complaints Tribunal Regulations 2002</strong>&#151;That the 
            Transport and the Environment Committee, in consideration of the draft 
            Bus user Complaints Tribunal Regulations 2002, recommends that the 
            Regulations be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2936</strong> <strong>Kay Ullrich: Dungavel Detention 
            Centre</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern reports 
            on the conditions in which asylum seekers are being held at the Dungavel 
            Detention Centre, including references made to a lack of privacy and 
            freedom of movement, effectively creating a prison environment for 
            the people, including young children, who are guilty of no offence; 
            further notes with concern the reported suicide attempt at Dungavel 
            of the Nigerian asylum seeker, Mr Dotun Adeosun, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to liase with the Home Office and to encourage 
            Her Majesty&#146;s Government to accede to requests by human rights 
            groups, such as the Friends of Refugees in Ayrshire, to have wider 
            access to visit and meet asylum seekers at the centre and to provide 
            them with support and to inspect the conditions in which detainees 
            there are held.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2935</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Colourfest 2002</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">welcomes the announcement that 
            Scotland&#146;s biggest dance music festival, Colourfest 2002, is 
            to be held in Glasgow on 2 June 2002 with Radio One, Clyde 1 and world 
            class DJs and performers from around the UK and Europe bringing 10,000 
            young people to the city venue.</a></p>
