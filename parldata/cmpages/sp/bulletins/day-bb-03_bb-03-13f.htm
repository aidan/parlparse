          <p><strong>*S1M-4019 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Dog Fouling (Scotland) Bill - Business Motion</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament agrees that, during the Stage 3 proceedings on the 
            Dog Fouling (Scotland) Bill, debate on each part of those proceedings 
            shall be brought to a conclusion by the time-limits indicated (each

          <p> <strong>*S1M-4018</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: National Galleries 
            of Scotland Bill - Final Stage</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees 
            that the National Galleries of Scotland Bill be passed.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4017#</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: Proposed Closure 
            of Civic Amenity Sites in Fife</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the proposed closure of community civic amenity sites 
            in Fife; further notes that these closures are caused by requirements 
            being imposed by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) 
            which require that all such sites should be permanently staffed; believes 
            that this will result in the loss of valuable community facilities 
            across Scotland, particularly at weekends and evenings, which will 
            result in increased fly-tipping and greater risks to the environment, 
            and further believes that SEPA should cease imposing these requirements 
            with immediate effect.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4016#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler: Announcement of 
            Glasgow Airport Rail Link Project</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the announcement made on 12 March 2003 by the Minister for 
            Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning committing the Scottish 
            Executive to invest in the construction of the vital Glasgow Airport 
            rail link to Central Station; applauds the timetable for implementation 
            of the project which could begin as early as 2005 with a completion 
            date of 2008 and recognises that this will result in Glasgow being 
            the first city in Scotland to have a completed direct airport rail 
            link; notes that the new airport rail link will provide Glasgow with 
            a direct connection to three international airports and believes that 
            this will contribute in a positive fashion to the economic development 
            of Glasgow and west central Scotland; accepts that this announcement 
            does not preclude the Glasgow crossrail project from being developed 
            in due course, and praises the commitment of Glasgow&#146;s MSPs, 
            Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Passenger Transport, Glasgow Chamber 
            of Commerce and <em>The Evening Times</em> in campaigning, and arguing, 
            for this much-needed transport project.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4015#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Welcome Overhaul 
            of Credit Laws</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the decision 
            of the Department of Trade and Industry to introduce legislation that 
            will, at long last, give greater protection against those avaricious 
            companies that inflict extortionate interest charges upon vulnerable 
            borrowers; believes that the Scottish Executive, Scottish banks, credit 
            unions and local authorities have an important role to play in the 
            proposed safeguards to be given to decent, ordinary people who are 
            hoodwinked by such disreputable companies, and further believes that 
            ways and means must be found to eliminate the predatory activities 
            of loan sharks who continue to ply their evil trade in communities 
            throughout Scotland.</p>

            that Her Majesty&#146;s Government should withdraw its support for

            approval of the United Nations, it would be contrary to international 
            law and therefore urges Her Majesty's Government to use its diplomatic 
            influence to work for peace rather than war.&quot;</p>

            in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from second &quot;no&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;weapons inspectors must be given sufficient 
            time to effect disarmament within Iraq, but as part of a worldwide 
            campaign of disarmament including Israel, Pakistan, India, Great Britain, 
            the United States of America, China, Russia and other states in possession 
            of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction; recognises the increased 
            threat of global dominance imposed by the USA on the basis of economic 
            and military control throughout the globe and regrets the increasingly 
            aggressive statements and actions by the USA in pursuit of its stated 
            desire to build a new American empire in the 21st Century; deplores 
            the fact that 300,000 children a day die from preventable diseases 
            like malaria, tuberculosis and cholera, all products of poverty; further 
            believes therefore that all-out war on poverty and inequality throughout 
            the world should be the United Nations&#146; priority and that such 
            a war would be the most effective assault on terrorism and the causes 
            of terrorism throughout the Middle East and the world, and further 
            supports those citizens of Scotland committed to engaging in peaceful 
            civil disobedience in opposition to war with Iraq, should Her Majesty&#146;s

            Security Council Resolution 1441; calls for the inspectors to be given 
            sufficient time and resources to continue their work as long as the 
            Security Council assesses that progress can be made; believes that 
            only as a last resort, once all other options have been exhausted, 
            should military action in Iraq be undertaken, and opposes any military 
            action not sanctioned by a further resolution from the Security Council
