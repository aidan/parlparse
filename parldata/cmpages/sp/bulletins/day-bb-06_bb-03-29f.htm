<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;    ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4205#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Closure of Borders CABx</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the closure of four Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) in the Scottish Borders, at Jedburgh, Innerleithen, Coldstream and Chirnside; further notes that four other centres at Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Berwickshire are having their hours of opening severely cut; commends the work of CABx in the Borders which, as elsewhere in Scotland, provide free and accessible services on complex issues such as debt, benefits, housing, employment and family relationships, often to the most vulnerable people, and recognises that last year these offices recovered a total of &pound;2.5 million for clients and therefore that immediate support should be provided by the Scottish government to prevent these cuts in service.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4204</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Tram (Line One) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during the Final Stage of the Edinburgh Tram (Line One) Bill, the debate on groups of amendments shall be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated (that time being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when the meeting of the Parliament is suspended or otherwise not in progress):</p>
