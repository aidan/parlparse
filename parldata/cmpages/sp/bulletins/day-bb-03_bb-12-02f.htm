          <p><strong>*S2M-685</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Modernising 
            Access to Legal Advice, Information and Representation</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the progress made to date on modernising access 
            to legal advice, information and representation; agrees the importance 
            of increasing access to justice through a better and more consistent 
            provision of legal information and advice throughout Scotland, and 
            welcomes the strategic review of the delivery of legal aid, advice 
            and information as a means of ensuring a better and more efficient 
            public service in line with the needs of Scottish citizens.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-684#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Linked 
            Work and Training Trust Central - BURA Award</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates Linked Work and Training Trust Central (LWTTC) on its 
            Best Practice in Regeneration award, the only Scottish organisation 
            among this year's five British Urban Regeneration Association (BURA) 
            awards; notes BURA's comment that LWTTC is an outstanding example 
            of a project that &quot;builds the capacity of excluded communities 
            to develop and harness their own skills, commitment, experience and 
            confidence to contribute to sustained local economic and social regeneration&quot;; 
            further notes that in <em>Empowered To Practice: The Future of Community 
            Learning and Development Training in Scotland</em> the Scottish Executive 
            recognised the LWTTC model of work-based training and recommended 
            its expansion, and believes that the Executive should ensure that 
            funding authorities support the wider adoption of such programmes.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-683#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Outdoor 
            Education</strong>-That the Parliament regrets that there is no national 
            programme for outdoor education in Scotland; notes that programmes 
            for outdoor education vary greatly from council to council; further 
            notes that schools within the separate councils lack uniformity in 
            implementing outdoor education programmes and regrets that children 
            are not receiving equal access to the opportunities and advantages 
            provided by outdoor education; regrets that financial factors, socio-economic 
            factors and lack of access to facilities all serve as barriers to 
            outdoor education; regrets that the lack of a requirement for outdoor 
            education to be taught in schools has led to a serious decline in 
            the number of outdoor education teachers employed in Scotland; regrets 
            that, despite the General Teaching Council's recommendation in 2000, 
            there is still no national teaching qualification in outdoor education; 
            regrets that there is no Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools with specific 
            expertise in, or responsibility for, outdoor education; regrets that 
            primary teachers and geography teachers receive minimal training in 
            outdoor education; further regrets that there is a decline in the 
            number of biology students on outdoor environmental studies courses, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should set up a short life 
            working group to report before June 2004 on all these issues.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-682</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Governance (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees to 
            the general principles of the Local Governance (Scotland) Bill.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-681#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Apology 
            Demanded for Poll Tax</strong>-That the Parliament notes the admission 
            by Malcolm Rifkind, the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland 
            responsible for the introduction of the poll tax on 1 April 1989, 
            that it was &quot;a great political mistake&quot;; rejects the assertion 
            that it was his government's presentation of the poll tax that was 
            flawed, and considers that Mr Rifkind and the Conservative Party in 
            Scotland should now, after 14 years, apologise to the thousands of 
            people in Scotland who were pursued for payment of a tax they could 
            not pay and apologise to the people of Scotland for using Scotland 
            as the guinea pig for their unfair and unjust tax system and their 
            immoral and draconian methods of collecting it.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-680</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>M74 
            Public Local Inquiry</strong>-That the Parliament recognises and agrees 
            that the answer to question S2F-383 by the First Minister on 27 November 
            2003 concerning the M74 motorway extension clearly gives an appearance 
            of bias; believes that the Scottish Executive has conflicting roles 
            in the decision-making process; further believes that the public local 
            inquiry under way from 1 December 2003 has now been compromised such 
            that under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights the 
            objectors are entitled to hold the view that the appeal process does 
            not provide them with a fair and impartial hearing, and considers 
            that the inquiry should be abandoned until such time as a process 
            can be put in place that complies with Article 6.</P>
