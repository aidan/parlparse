<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2102</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Small Business Bonus Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the introduction, on 1 April 2008, of the Small Business Bonus Scheme; notes that businesses have reacted positively to the scheme, and believes that businesses themselves are best placed to decide how to use the reductions in business rates resulting from the scheme to invest in their own success and to deliver new opportunities, new employment and new ventures throughout Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2101</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Energy Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the UK Energy Bill in Part 1, Chapter 3 (Storage of Carbon Dioxide), introduced to the House of Commons on 10 January 2008, should, insofar as they relate to matters within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or alter the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers, be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2100</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>London Mayor&rsquo;s Remarks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses disappointment at the comments made by London Mayor, Boris Johnson, that UK residents in London and the South East of England are &quot;resentful&quot; for &quot;forking out for things in Scotland&quot;; believes that such remarks are counter-productive to promoting a constructive working relationship between different parts of the United Kingdom; agrees with the Scottish Labour Party; the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party that these claims are untrue, given that London receives higher public funding per head than Scotland, and hopes that these views are not shared by the UK or Scottish wing of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>Supported by: Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>

<p>1.2.1  The Scheme is to be administered by the SPCB.</p>

<p><strong>1.5&#9;REVIEW OF DECISIONS AND IMPROPER CLAIMS</strong></p>
<p>1.5.1  Where a member disputes a decision either not to reimburse expenses or costs or not to approve expenses or costs for reimbursement, the SPCB may review that decision. Any decision of the SPCB on review is final and it shall intimate the result of that review to the member.</p>

Where, following such an investigation, the SPCB finds that a member has submitted an improper claim, the SPCB may report to the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee and may recommend the removal of all or part of the member&rsquo;s entitlement to reimbursement of expenses under this Scheme for such period and to such extent as the SPCB may specify.</p>
<p><strong>1.6&#9;VIREMENT</strong></p>

<p>4.2.8  On the application of a member the SPCB may, if satisfied that local variations in the market for office accommodation make it impracticable for the member to establish and run a suitable local parliamentary office within the limit of costs which can be reimbursed under this Section, increase by up to 10% the  limit on entitlement to reimbursement which would otherwise be applicable to that member.</p>
<p>4.2.9&#9;A member is not entitled to reimbursement of costs in respect of a local parliamentary office if the member leases office premises from or sub-lets any part of office premises to a close family member or connected person. </p>

The SPCB shall not reimburse rent incurred until such a report has been provided.  If, on the basis of the report, the SPCB determines that the rent payable in terms of the lease is greater than the fair market rent, the member shall be deemed to be liable only for the fair market rent and the member&rsquo;s entitlement to reimbursement shall be calculated on that basis.</p>
<p>4.2.12 A member who sub-lets local parliamentary office premises or part of those premises to a party political organisation shall, before concluding the sub-lease, supply to the SPCB a report prepared by an independent surveyor providing a professional opinion as to the fair market rent for the premises concerned when sub-let on the same terms.  If, on the basis of the report, the SPCB determines that the rent payable in terms of the sub-lease is less than the fair market rent, the member shall be deemed to be in receipt of the fair market rent and any rent reimbursed shall be calculated on that basis. </p>
<p>4.2.13  A member is not entitled to reimbursement of office costs in respect of a local parliamentary office which is shared with a Member of the House of Commons (&quot;MP&quot;) or a Member of the European Parliament (&quot;MEP&quot;) unless the member has entered into a written agreement with the MP or MEP as to the apportionment of costs and the terms of the agreement have been approved by the SPCB. </p>

<p><strong>S3M-2082</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Stamp Duty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in light of increased household and fuel costs and the so-called &quot;credit crunch&quot; with its increasingly devastating effects on house sales in Scotland, itself impacting on small businesses such as removal firms, building trades and many others and blocking the movement of house sales so that first-time buyers are effectively barred from the property ladder, considers that a review of Stamp Duty, which has remained constant since 2006, is imperative and that such a review should consider increasing the threshold for the 0% band and, on subsequent bands, making duty payable only incrementally and not on the entire purchase price and that this is one small method of easing the burden on first-time buyers and freeing up the housing market.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2082.1</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Stamp Duty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2082) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave out from &quot;on subsequent bands&quot; and insert &quot;welcomes the Conservative&rsquo;s commitment to abolish stamp duty on homes up to &pound;250,000 which will mean that nine-out-of-10 first-time buyers pay no stamp duty.&quot;</p>
