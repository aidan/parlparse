          <P><strong>*S2M-612</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Potential 
            G8 Summit at Gleneagles</strong>-That the Parliament notes reports 
            that Gleneagles is being considered as a potential venue for a G8 
            summit meeting; expresses concern at the disruption this could cause 
            for strategic road and rail links and the negative impact that would 
            have on both the local and national economy; recognises the immense 
            pressures that would be placed on police by the scale of the security 
            operation required; supports the bringing of international events 
            to Scotland but believes that the G8 summit represents a poisoned 
            chalice, and regrets that the decision to consider Gleneagles appears 
            to have been based on a belief amongst the Foreign and Commonwealth 
            Office that Gleneagles is remote.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-611</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Threat 
            to Teachers' Pensions</strong>-That the Parliament notes Her Majesty's 
            Government's Green Paper <em>Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working 
            and Saving for Retirement</em> on teachers' pensions; is opposed to 
            the proposals which would raise the minimum age for taking an occupational 
            pension from 60 to 65 and will have hugely detrimental effects on 
            the future well-being of teachers and their profession; fears that 
            such plans, if implemented, will deter young people from entering 
            the profession with its highly stressful working environment and will 
            force many long-serving teachers to work for five further years beyond 
            their expected retirement date, only serving to disillusion and dishearten 
            them, given that half the secondary teaching workforce is within 12 
            years of retirement; believes that these proposals will make it extremely 
            difficult to recruit new teachers, and therefore supports the Secondary 
            School Teachers' Association's campaign to have the proposals overturned.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-610</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>People, 
            Pensions and Post Offices</strong>-That the Parliament notes the House 
            of Commons Trade and Industry Committee report <em>People, Pensions 
            and Post Offices: the impact of 'Direct Payment' on post offices and 
            their customers</em>; commends the recommendations of the report that 
            Her Majesty's Government should revisit a number of areas of policy 
            which could be improved to help to give customer choice as well as 
            protecting post offices; very much regrets, however, the response 
            of Her Majesty's Government which ignores the great majority of the 
            recommendations, and urges the Scottish Executive to encourage Her 
            Majesty's Government to pursue the implementation of the report in 
            order to safeguard the future of Scotland's rural post offices.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-609</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> 
            <strong>Deployment of Royal Scots to Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament 
            expresses strong support to all the soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 
            the Royal Scots, on their deployment for peacekeeping duties in Iraq; 
            recalls the fine service of the first regiment of foot in the British 
            Army in the first Gulf War; endorses the objective of restoring security 
            and helping the Iraqi people to achieve a better future after decades 
            of oppressive government, and looks forward to the successful conclusion 
            of this mission and the safe return of Scottish service personnel 
            to their homes and families.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-608</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>The 
            Mink Keeping (Scotland) Order 2003 (SSI 2003/528)</strong>-That the 
            Environment and Rural Development Committee recommends that the Mink 
            Keeping (Scotland) Order 2003 (SSI 2003/528) be approved.</P>

            (SSI 2003/518)</strong>-That the Environment and Rural Development

            Amendment Scheme 2003 (SSI 2003/518) be approved.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-606#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Scotland's 
            Football Victory</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the national 
            Scotland football team for a stunning victory against the Netherlands 
            in the first leg of the UEFA Euro 2004 play off and sends warmest 
            wishes and encouragement for the second leg; regrets that the game 
            was not available on terrestrial TV; is concerned at the monopoly 
            of TV coverage by satellite television; believes that all Scots should 
            be able to access national games where they choose; is concerned that 
            women, who bear the greatest responsibility for childcare, will be 
            less able to go to a public house and therefore less likely to be 
            able to see these games, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should intervene to try to secure universal coverage of all future 
            Scotland games so that all of Scotland can be united in cheering the 
            team on.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-605</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>European 
            Championship Play Offs</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Scotland football squad on the marvellous performance and result 
            in the first leg play off against the Netherlands at Hampden, particularly 
            the goal from James McFadden, and offers its full support to the team 
            for the second leg in Amsterdam.</P>
