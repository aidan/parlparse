<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3949</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Demand for a Public Inquiry into Shirley McKie Case</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive has agreed to make a settlement in the compensation claim by Shirley McKie against it; considers that this issue of compensation could have been resolved much sooner following her acquittal in 1999 of having committed perjury; considers that the failure to resolve the issue in a more timely fashion has resulted in years of misery for Shirley McKie and her family; notes that, despite her acquittal in 1999, failure to resolve the issue sooner may have led to a tarnishing of her reputation; commends the McKie family for their bravery in fighting for justice, and calls for a full public inquiry into the role of the police, Scottish Criminal Records Office, the Crown Office and the Executive in this case, in particular their reason for bringing an action of perjury against Shirley McKie in the first instance and their failure to resolve the situation in a timely manner following her acquittal.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3948</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Scottish Commissioner for Human Rights Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Scottish Commissioner for Human Rights Bill, agrees to any expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(ii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3947</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>North Ayrshire Schools Concert</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates North Ayrshire Council&rsquo;s educational services department on hosting the forthcoming 10th Anniversary Flagship Concert at the Royal ConcertH Hall in Glasgow, due to take place on Friday 24 February 2006; notes that this year&rsquo;s concert will feature the North Ayrshire junior, intermediate and senior choirs, concert band, training band, string orchestras, symphony orchestra, traditional music students and the Stanecastle Band, meaning that over 400 students from across North Ayrshire will take to the stage to showcase their musical talents; acknowledges the hard work and practice that all these young people will have committed in recent months to prepare for the event, and sends its best wishes to North Ayrshire Council, the pupils and teaching staff involved for a very successful event.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3946</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Fuel Tax Concessions for Scottish Highlands and Islands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that more tax is paid on a litre of fuel in the Highlands and Islands than any other area of the United Kingdom; notes the French Government&rsquo;s recent decision to allow its regional councils to introduce reduced rates of duty for road fuel consumed within their territories; further notes that this decision was reached with the prior approval of the Council of Ministers which included ministers from the UK Government; observes that the European Commission elected to allow this derogation from the Energy Products Directive to permit this measure; condemns Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government for its refusal to countenance any move to reduce fuel prices in rural or island communities of Scotland; notes that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government has ruled out any assistance for rural and island Scotland whilst supporting a similar policy of the French Government which would see reductions of fuel duty by 3% until 2011; believes that this refusal shows that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury, led by a Scot, is totally out of touch with the needs of rural and island communities of Scotland and has no understanding of how high fuel taxes affect areas of Scotland like Na h-Eileanan an Iar; further believes that, since these powers exist to assist regional economies, the UK Government should consider at least a 3% reduction in the rate of duty on petrol and diesel for extension across other areas of the Highlands and Islands and other rural and remote parts of Scotland, where it is required; calls on the Scottish Executive, including the Liberal Democrat Minister for Transport and Telecommunications, the Liberal Democrat Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning and all Liberal Democrat MSPs, to give its backing to the campaign to see in Scotland the same powers available to protect rural and island communities from higher fuel prices as are to be enjoyed by French communities, and further calls on Liberal Democrat MSPs to set a new precedent by adopting the same policy in Scotland as that of Liberal Democrat MPs in London.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3944#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Lanarkshire United Health for All</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s consultation, <em>A Picture of Health</em>; is concerned that the board has written off the status quo as &quot;unsustainable&quot; without giving the public the opportunity to make that judgement about their health service; believes that to consult on options which exclude the possibility of a community retaining emergency and planned services at their local hospital is no choice at all; questions the rationale and evidence that the consultation is predicated on, such as whether planned capacity will be sufficient; is concerned that health inequalities will not be addressed and may indeed be perpetuated; recognises the growing anger of communities throughout Lanarkshire, and believes that the board and politicians alike have a duty to explore all options and strategies required to meet the needs of Lanarkshire&rsquo;s citizens and unite with them to secure full and equal health services for all.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3943</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Catering Equality</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body&rsquo;s (SPCB) current policy towards catering in the Parliament is elitist and exclusive; further believes that congestion in the canteen could be minimised if the first-floor restaurant was opened up; considers that the disproportionate subsidy of the currently named Members&rsquo; Restaurant for MSPs on already comfortable salaries, who can also claim expenses for meals when staying overnight, should cease; considers that access to the restaurant should be open at all times to everyone, and believes that the SPCB should consider also opening it to the public so that its capacity can be fully utilised.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3938</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth Scotland&rsquo;s Progress Report 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 2006 progress report from LGBT Youth Scotland; notes that, while there may be as many as 100,000 young people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, only around 6% have come out by the time they are 16; applauds the positive work done by the group in liaising with local authorities, the police, education authorities, health services, government and others to help shape policy, and fully supports it in its quest to help ease the transition of young people into adulthood.</p>
