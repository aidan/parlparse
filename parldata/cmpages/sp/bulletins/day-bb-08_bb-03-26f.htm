<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section.</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Ministerial Statement: Scottish Prison Service Report on Robert Foye</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1631</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Local Government Finance (Scotland) Amendment Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Amendment Order 2008 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1630</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Scottish Mining Museum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that a report has identified that the buildings of the Lady Victoria Colliery, Europe&rsquo;s best preserved 19th century pit complex, denoted as being of international significance by Historic Scotland and recently nominated as Scotland&rsquo;s most treasured place, are increasingly fragile and urgently require &pound;2.5 million to preserve them and urges Scottish Ministers to ensure that the fabric of the colliery buildings is secured for the enjoyment and education of future generations; considers the colliery to be a hugely important part of Scotland&rsquo;s industrial heritage, and believes that appropriate support for the future care of the buildings and operation of the Scottish Mining Museum must be made available.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1629</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken on behalf of the Justice Committee:</strong> <strong>Report on Inquiry into the Effective Use of Police Resources</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Justice Committee&rsquo;s 4th Report, 2008 (Session 3): <em>Report on Inquiry into the Effective Use of Police Resources (SP Paper 50).</em></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1628</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Inverclyde Learning Centres Win Prestigious Award from Government</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement that the Federation of Community Learning Centres in Inverclyde has won an award from Learndirect Scotland for helping people into training and jobs; notes that the award recognises the achievements that the centres have made in making learning easy and accessible for students with families or those who require extra needs, and further notes that this prestigious award is part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s skills strategy with the five centres to be honoured being Larkfield Youth Connections, Riverview Centre in Port Glasgow, Craigend Resource Centre, Branchton Community Centre and Greenock&rsquo;s Second Chance Learning Project.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1627&diams;</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>MS Awareness Week 21-27 April 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the focus on the emotional, physical and financial costs of multiple sclerosis of this year&rsquo;s MS Awareness Week which runs from 21 to 27 April 2008; recognises that Scotland has the highest rate of the condition in the world and that its costs can be significant for the approximately 10,500 people living with multiple sclerosis in Scotland as they deal with the impact that it can have on every aspect of their lives; supports the work that the MS Society Scotland does to provide advice, support and information to people affected by MS, and recognises that, while considerable progress has been made in the provision of MS specialists in NHS boards, the statutory services available to people affected by MS remain variable across the country and that social care services in particular need to improve so that high-quality support is available wherever people live in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1626#</strong> <strong>Angela Constance:</strong> <strong>No Recourse No Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of <em>No Recourse No Safety: The Government&rsquo;s Failure to Protect Women from Violence</em>, a report by Amnesty International and the Southall Black Sisters; is disturbed by the evidence that not having recourse to public funds prevents women with insecure immigration status from accessing the benefits they need to claim refuge, effectively trapping women in violence or destitution; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to tackling violence against women, continuing the good work commenced by the previous Scottish administration; acknowledges the pivotal contribution of local services such as the West Lothian Council Domestic Abuse Service which provides a service to women from a minority population; notes that not having recourse to public funds affects women who have valid visas as spouses, students, visitors and workers and those who are classed as &quot;overstayers&quot; in addition to victims of trafficking; acknowledges that organisations such as West Lothian Women&rsquo;s Aid are accommodating and assisting women with no recourse to public funds, and commends the recommendations of <em>No Recourse No Safety</em>, in particular the need for the Scottish Government to put in place emergency funding while a permanent solution from the UK Government is sought, namely exempting women fleeing violence from the no recourse to public funds requirement.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1625</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>International Committee of the Red Cross Report on State of Iraq</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of <em>Iraq: No Let-up in the Humanitarian Crisis </em>by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); expresses its serious concern at the findings of this paper which include that &quot;millions of Iraqis have insufficient access to clean water, sanitation and health care&quot;, that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of Iraqi civilians have disappeared since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, that there are only 30,000 hospital beds in public hospitals when 80,000 are required, that a &quot;lack of midwives means that many women giving birth at night must do so without assistance&quot;, that even though the estimated average monthly salary in Iraq is now around US $150 that many Iraqi families must spend around US $50 per month on water as the production of drinking water has steadily worsened over the last year, which directly contributed to an outbreak of cholera in 2007; commends the ICRC for its humanitarian work in Iraq alongside the Iraqi Red Crescent which has included clarifying the status of many missing Iraqis, as well as providing assistance to tens of thousands of displaced persons and needy Iraqi residents with food and other essentials and supporting the delivery of medical services; believes that the findings of the ICRC are further evidence of the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the invasion of Iraq in 2003, rubbing further salt into the wounds of the Iraqi people following the disaster of a decade of sanctions, and calls on the international community to work positively with the ICRC and other non-governmental organisations trying to improve the lives of ordinary Iraqi citizens.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1624</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Learning for Life</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the <em>Learning for Life: From Inspiration to Aspiration </em>book launch and exhibition that is taking place in the Parliament this week; is pleased to host this showcase of work by young people from across Scotland who have taken part in the Values Poster Award programme; recognises that this character education programme inspires young people and raises their aspirations; supports the work of Learning for Life, and wishes the charity well in its ambition to engage with many more young people across Scotland, both those who are in education, employment or training and those who are not, in order to help them realise their full potential.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1623</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Scottish World Cup Qualifier Broadcasts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with utmost concern that the BBC failed to broadcast Scottish World Cup qualifiers although it is able to spend an excessive &pound;200 million on screening Formula 1; believes this to be unacceptable as football is Scotland&rsquo;s national sport and should be made a priority in terms of sports coverage in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to apply pressure on the BBC to immediately address this problem and to persuade the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport to add the home nations&rsquo; world cup qualifiers to its list of &quot;crown jewels&quot; of sporting events that must be available to terrestrial broadcasters.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1621</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Healthcare Associated Infection Taskforce</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to bring infection rates down by investing &pound;54 million to support a far more intensive and targeted three-year programme of healthcare associated infection (HAI) work from 1 April 2008; believes that the Scottish Government is right to introduce a one-year pilot MRSA screening programme to shape a planned, structured and deliverable national screening programme from 2009-10; welcomes the links that will be established between the Patient Safety and Patient Experience programmes and the HAI agenda to bring about a coherency of approach in the way that NHSScotland delivers its service to patients; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s continuation of the multi-agency HAI Task Force, and agrees with the challenging target that the Scottish Government has set for all staff of NHS boards to achieve at least 90% hand hygiene compliance by November 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1621.1</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Healthcare Associated Infection Taskforce</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1621) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;commends the progress made by the previous Labour-led government in establishing the HAI Task Force and ensuring that Scotland was a model for tackling healthcare associated infections and should continue to be so; asks the Scottish Government to commit to tackling all healthcare associated infections, not just MRSA; notes the importance of combating infections in care homes, and calls for a specific plan of action to do so.&quot;</p>
