<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3873</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>NHS Health Newspaper Talking to the Masses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for providing its newsletter, <em>Health News</em>, in a talking newspaper format, allowing blind and partially sighted people to keep up-to-date with information about health services; notes that the NHS board will use JAWS audio software on its website for the talking newspaper; acknowledges that by providing its newsletter in this format NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is showing its commitment to providing accessible health information for visually impaired people, and encourages other NHS boards to improve the accessibility of information for blind and partially sighted people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3872</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Additional Help with Heating Costs for People Affected by Disability</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Scotland&rsquo;s homes are on average more expensive to heat than those in other parts of the United Kingdom, with the cost of heating properties in Stornoway up to 63% higher than in Bristol, those in Aberdeen 57% higher, Dundee 30% higher and Kilmarnock up to 24% higher; recognises that these additional costs are borne most heavily by people affected by disability who are less able to leave their homes during the winter and are therefore required to heat their properties fully for longer periods; expresses concern that benefits for disabled people are unable to cope with the more than doubling of gas costs and the substantial increase in electricity costs in the last five years, and calls on the Department for Work and Pensions to provide additional help with heating to Scots affected by disability when they need it most.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3871</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Grampian Police Knife Amnesty Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success of the recent knife amnesty held by Grampian Police over the last nine months, during which more than 1,000 knives and other weapons were anonymously handed in to police; congratulates Grampian Police for its proactive approach and success in taking knives off the streets of Aberdeen; believes that the number of knives handed in during a knife amnesty is likely to represent only a fraction of those that are being carried; agrees that these figures are a stark reminder that knife carrying is not just a west coast or a central belt problem but a problem that affects every part of Scotland; believes that one knife on the streets of Scotland is one knife too many; notes that the last Scotland-wide knife amnesty was held under the previous administration, between May and June 2006, during which a total of 12,642 knives were taken off the streets, and calls on the Scottish Government to hold a properly resourced high-profile Scotland-wide knife amnesty to help rid the streets of knives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3870&diams; </strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Bookstart Rhymetimes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in delivering the Bookstart Rhymetimes programme across Scotland, including North Lanarkshire Council library staff, for the excellent work that they are carrying out in taking music and books to the heart of the parent and child relationship; recognises the significant benefits that this approach can deliver in terms of speech and language development and parent and child bonding; further recognises that research shows that babies and toddlers who are introduced to books at an early stage begin reading sooner and have a better chance at school, and looks forward to the continued success of this programme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3869</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>UK Nuclear Submarines Involved in 14 Collisions and Over 200 Fires</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the admission that UK nuclear submarines have been involved in 14 collisions since 1979 and that over 200 fires have occurred on board nuclear submarines since 1987; considers that a number of these fires occurred when the nuclear submarines were at base resulting in the need for external help to contain the situations, and believes that the real possibility of a nuclear disaster, which could potentially cause untold suffering to the people of Scotland, demonstrates why it is time to remove these weapons of mass destruction from Scottish waters and for the UK Government to abandon its plans to renew Trident.</p>
