            notes the proposed sale by Scottish Media Group of the titles <em>The 
            Herald, Sunday Herald </em>and<em> Evening Times</em>; recognises 
            the contribution these titles make in providing Scotland with diverse 
            media, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            make representations to Her Majesty's Government to ensure that any 
            sale does not lead to a monopoly situation.</p>

            the Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in the 
            sums payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence

            by adults to deceive, beguile and lure children into compromising 
            situations with a view to sexual gratification, sometimes known as 
            &quot;grooming&quot;; further notes that there may be a lacuna in 
            existing criminal law in this regard; notes that the Scottish Executive 
            is investigating whether a new statutory offence is required, and 
            considers that the Executive should extend its inquiry and any potential 
            new statutory offence to cover vulnerable adults.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3586</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Heartstart</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes Heartstart, the British Heart Foundation's 
            Scottish schools initiative, which aims to develop emergency life 
            support training programmes in our schools; congratulates those schools 
            throughout Scotland that have already signed up to this programme 
            and have benefited from teacher training free of charge and generous 
            grants for training equipment, and urges local authorities to ensure 
            that those schools that have not yet affiliated are encouraged to 
            do so, in order to provide young people with invaluable lifesaving 
            skills.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3585</strong> <strong>Ben Wallace: Armed Forces Personnel 
            and Firefighting Duties</strong>-That the Parliament supports the 
            brave young men and and women of the armed forces in Scotland who 
            are putting their lives at risk in order to cover the reckless and 
            dangerous strike by Scottish firefighters; demands that the Scottish 
            Executive immediately steps up concurrent training for armed forces 
            personnel to allow them to use better firefighting equipment and, 
            in addition, give them access to basic protective clothing; believes 
            that public safety and the safety of the armed forces personnel must 
            come before trade union demands, and notes that the armed forces carry 
            out these essential services ill-equipped and for considerably lower 
            pay than firefighters and with no right to strike.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3584#</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Edinburgh Park 
            Railway Station</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent announcement 
            that construction of the Edinburgh Park Railway Station can begin; 
            welcomes the funding supplied by the Strategic Rail Authority, City 
            of Edinburgh Council and New Edinburgh Ltd; further welcomes the investment 
            in new rolling stock from the Scottish Executive; is concerned that 
            agreement on the project was delayed by performance targets; considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should examine how this station can serve 
            the Edinburgh to Glasgow rail line, and considers that the Executive 
            should ensure that construction of the station and the provision of 
            additional rolling stock is completed as soon as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3583</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: White Ribbon Campaign 
            to End Violence Against Women</strong>-That the Parliament supports 
            the White Ribbon Campaign, which leads up to the UN International 
            Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on 25 November 2002; 
            recognises the white ribbon as the international symbol for a world 
            where women and girls can live free from the fear of violence; supports 
            the work of the UK White Ribbon Campaign, co-ordinated by WOMANKIND 
            Worldwide, to raise funds and awareness to end violence against women; 
            notes with alarm the prevalence and gravity of violence against women, 
            with one in four women in the UK experiencing domestic violence at 
            some point in their lives, and one in 20 women suffering rape, and 
            at least one in every three women around the world being beaten, coerced 
            into sex, or abused in some other way, and urges MSPs and others to 
            support this campaign by wearing a white ribbon to show their support 
            for ending violence against women.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3582</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Personal Care</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern that The Highland Council has considered 
            tightening the rules covering eligibility for free personal care because 
            of a funding shortfall of about £300,000; further notes that more 
            than 75,000 people in Scotland are estimated to be eligible for free 
            care following the decision by the Parliament and the Scottish Executive 
            to provide such free care; recognises that the council received just 
            over £4 million from the Executive to meet the costs of providing 
            free personal and nursing care in its area but that demand has proven 
            to be higher than predicted, and calls on the Executive to fulfil 
            its commitment to free personal care by meeting the shortfall in funding 
            as soon as possible. </p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3581#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler: Schooling of Children 
            of Asylum Seekers</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the requirement contained within the Nationality, Immigration and 
            Asylum Act 2002, which stipulates that the children of asylum seekers 
            be schooled outwith the mainstream local authority education system 
            in purpose-built accommodation centres; fears that such a condition, 
            which requires separate educational provision for the children of 
            asylum seekers, will in effect lead to segregation rather than integration; 
            acknowledges that the present arrangement, as evidenced by a recent 
            survey conducted in Glasgow, is both inclusive and successful, and 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations 
            to the Home Secretary, the purpose of which would be to arrive at 
            an agreement whereby the current distinctive approach pertaining to 
            the schooling of asylum seeker children in Scotland is allowed to 
            continue.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3580#</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Glasgow Acute Health 
            Services Review</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continued and 
            growing concern of Glasgow residents regarding the Scottish Executive's 
            proposals following the recent Acute Health Services Review in Glasgow.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3579*#*</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Centre of Excellence 
            in Genealogy</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the long-established 
            position of Scotland as a country with a history of genealogical research, 
            development and expertise; notes recent technological developments 
            in the study of genealogy which will allow greater access to Scotland's 
            excellent records; congratulates the General Register Office for Scotland 
            on its digitising programme, and urges the Scottish Executive to facilitate 
            the emergence of Scotland as a leading centre in Europe for the academic 
            study of family history research and genealogy by building partnerships 
            with all organisations that hold records of interest in Scotland to 
            maximise public access.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3578#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Bah Humbug</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that the advertising, promotion and sale of Christmas 
            as a commercial calendar event is now encroaching earlier and earlier 
            in the year and that such activities put unacceptable pressures particularly 
            on parents with young children, leading some understandably into financial 
            difficulties; further notes that retail staff and shoppers are subjected 
            to endless jingles before even Halloween masks have been reduced to 
            half price and pumpkins are buy one get six free, and therefore urges 
            the Scottish Executive to take such steps as are required to consign 
            Christmas to where it belongs, no earlier than the month of December.</p>

            vote on 7 November 2002 of the people of Gibraltar against shared 
            sovereignty of the Rock between the United Kingdom and Spain, and 
            calls on Her Majesty's Government to terminate forthwith all negotiations

            level of death and injury caused by road traffic accidents on the 
            A9 from Perth to Inverness; recognises that the design of the A9, 
            particularly the frequent switching between single and dual carriageway, 
            contributes to this level of danger; welcomes improvements made to 
            the road design to improve safety, particularly measures already agreed 
            at the Bankfoot and Ballinluig junctions, but recognises that, until 
            the A9 from Perth to Inverness is re-constructed as a dual carriageway 
            with safe junctions, it will continue to present road safety dangers 
            to the local community and the significant number of visitors to the

          <p><strong>S1M-3564</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Congratulations

            of the Titanic disaster and her efforts to tell the truth about the 
            heroic actions of First Officer William McMaster Murdoch of Dalbeattie; 
            records the gratitude of the people of Dalbeattie; supports Ms Stormer 
            in her continuing fight against a wrongful portrayal of Mr Murdoch 
            in James Cameron's film, Titanic, a portrayal that 20th Century Fox 
            eventually admitted was untrue; congratulates Ms Stormer on her latest 
            scholarly book <em>William McMaster Murdoch - a Career at Sea </em>which 
            shows that, but for Mr Murdoch's calmness and courage, even greater 
            loss of life could have occurred on Titanic, and notes that the sailor 
            from Dalbeattie stayed to the end, going down with the Titanic after 
            giving up his life jacket to another.</p>

            the Tayside Community Dental Service and other agencies throughout 
            Scotland for their efforts to inform the public about this disease; 
            notes with concern that in Scotland there are approximately 500 new 
            cases of oral cancer and 250 deaths per year, that less than 50% of 
            cases will survive five years and that the incidence of oral cancer 
            is on the increase in younger people, and encourages the Scottish 
            Executive to assist in raising public awareness of preventative measures 
            such as giving up smoking, reducing alcohol consumption and, most 
            importantly, visiting a dentist at least once a year.</p>

            answer sessions for MSPs, monitor and report on the progress of the
