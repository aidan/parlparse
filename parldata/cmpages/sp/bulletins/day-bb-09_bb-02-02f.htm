<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3352#</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Good Morning Glasgow Doing a Great Job for Glaswegians</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the tremendous contribution that the Good Morning Project, also known as Good Morning Glasgow and based in Possilpark in the north of Glasgow, has made to the lives of many vulnerable Glaswegians; congratulates it on its award<font color="#0000ff">-</font>winning telephone-based befriending service whereby trained staff call clients at a pre-arranged time each morning and often in the afternoon and evening; believes that the service contributes to better mental health, reduces isolation, promotes social inclusion and potentially enables elderly and vulnerable people to stay in their own homes for longer; notes that formal evaluations show that 100% of clients reported reduced feelings of isolation and exclusion along with improved feelings of safety; further acknowledges that the lowest rating was 97% of clients who believed that the service gave peace of mind to family and friends; believes that this demonstrates the invaluable contribution Good Morning Glasgow makes to individuals and the community as a whole, and considers that similar services could benefit people throughout Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3351</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive Opt-out</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the vote by the European Parliament on 17 December 2008 in favour of removing Britain&rsquo;s working time directive opt-out; also notes with serious concern the effect that the removal of the opt-out will have on retained firefighters across Scotland and the consequences that it may have for public health and safety; further notes that of 391 fire stations across Scotland 321 are staffed by 3,429 retained firefighters; notes the valuable service that these volunteer firefighters provide to their communities and that the Retained Firefighters Union opposes the removal of the opt-out; considers that, if the opt-out is removed and Retained Duty System (RDS) fire stations are proven unviable under the working time directive, 91% of the United Kingdom will lose valuable emergency fire cover, and notes the serious and potentially fatal consequences that the removal will have on communities across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3350</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>90th Anniversary of George Square&rsquo;s Bloody Friday</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 31 January 2009 is the 90th anniversary of the congregation of tens of thousands of striking workers in George Square, Glasgow, organised by the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Clyde Workers&rsquo; Committee, which led to a confrontation between the workers and the authorities of the time, an event that became known as Bloody Friday; recalls that the then UK Government hugely overreacted to these events by sending troops and tanks from England onto the streets of Glasgow while locking local troops into the Maryhill Barracks for fear that they might side with the striking workers; further notes that this was one of the seminal events of the Red Clydeside movement; salutes the memory of the striking workers, whose actions contributed to the eventual securing of important guarantees of working conditions and practices; believes that the Red Clydeside experience has continued to influence politics in Scotland to the present day, and further believes that a greater awareness of this period of history should be fostered among Scotland&rsquo;s wider population.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3303</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>BBC Refusal to Broadcast the Emergency Appeal for Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by the BBC not to broadcast the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for Gaza and the fact that this decision may have influenced the decision of other broadcasters; notes the statement by Douglas Alexander MP, the Secretary of State for International Development, in which he expresses his disappointment that the appeal will not be broadcast; believes that this decision will severely affect the ability of the aid agencies to respond to the extreme needs of the people in Gaza and will add to their immense suffering, and further believes that the BBC should reverse this decision immediately.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3302</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>BBC and the Gaza Appeal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of broadcasters to refuse to provide air time to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal in relation to the humanitarian disaster in Gaza; believes that this is a breach of their moral obligations, which will contribute to the suffering of the civilian population of Gaza, and calls on all politicians and civic persons to withdraw their cooperation with these broadcasting organisations until they meet their moral obligation to respond to humanitarian disasters like the one in Gaza.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3301</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Free Football for Under-16s</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the fact that Partick Thistle Football Club is encouraging young people under the age of 16 to become involved in football by enabling them to attend its home matches for free; believes that young people taking advantage of this initiative will develop a sense of belonging and loyalty to the club; recognises that offering free tickets in this way can attract a new generation of fans to help clubs to thrive in the future; praises Dumbarton Football Club for providing free tickets for home matches to the local junior clubs, and would encourage all football clubs to consider providing free tickets to under-16s.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3293#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Combating Human Trafficking</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the need to develop appropriate strategies to combat the evil practice of trafficking people into Scotland; commends the important and continuing work of the International Justice Mission (IJM) to combat sex trafficking; notes that, in the 12 years since the organisation&rsquo;s founding, the IJM&rsquo;s investigations have resulted in freedom for hundreds of girls and women held by force in the commercial sex trade; also recognises that the IJM&rsquo;s founding principle is the defence and protection of individual human rights for all people by bringing the law to bear on their behalf and by prosecuting perpetrators who violate local and international laws; also notes the important contribution of local groups such as Cupar Justice and Peace Group on this issue, and further recognises the international and interdependent characteristics of human trafficking and the need for an internationally coordinated approach to bring about the end of such crimes here in Scotland and across the world.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3284#</strong> <strong>Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Investment in Schools in North Highland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the impact of the quality of a school&rsquo;s environment on the effectiveness of the education of its pupils and believes that the dilapidated state of a number of school buildings in the north Highlands impedes the education of many pupils; recognises Highland Council&rsquo;s lack of financial resources to renovate and build schools, and regrets the lack of a funding mechanism that would allow Highland Council to initiate a much-needed schools refurbishment and new-build programme.</p>
