            Scanlon: National Eye Week</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes National 
            Eye Week, beginning on 25 September, as a means of highlighting the 
            importance of regular eye examinations and improving visual healthcare, 
            particularly among the elderly, who are susceptible to macular degeneration; 
            notes that more than nine out of ten primary eye examinations in Scotland 
            are carried out by optometrists in the community; draws attention 
            to the increasing partnership between ophthalmologists, general medical 
            practitioners and optometrists in the co-management of eye diseases 
            such as cataract, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy; notes that such 
            diseases can be ameliorated, provided that they are detected and treated 
            early, and urges health boards and local healthcare co-operatives 
            to devote sufficient resources to ensure that such co-management schemes 
            are available in localities across the whole of Scotland.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1202</strong> <strong>Mr 
            Kenneth Gibson: Council Tax Collection</strong>—That the Parliament notes 
            the content of Citizens Advice Scotland’s report <i>Won’t Pay or Can’t 
            Pay – The Real Cost of Scotland’s Council Tax Debt</i>; is aware that 
            administrative problems, such as delays in processing forms or sending 
            out bills, billing errors and over-complicated forms result in a debt 
            crisis for those on low incomes; realises that lack of communication 
            between local authority departments and other agencies leads to delays 
            in people receiving their entitlement to council tax benefit despite 
            receiving related benefits such as housing benefit or income support; 
            is concerned that the process of proceeding straight to formal debt 
            collection without prior negotiation only increases overall indebtedness, 
            making it harder for the debtor to make reasonable and affordable 
            repayment plans; seeks from the Scottish Executive a commitment to 
            work with local authorities to identify practical ways of preventing 
            council debt occurring as a result of their own administrative processes, 
            looking in particular at the ability to pay and the development of 
            corporate debt strategies that will not make an individual’s debt 
            worse, and calls for a debate on why many Scots are unable, rather 
            than unwilling, to pay council tax debt. </font></p>

            that British American Tobacco marketing teams have been targeting 
            children in Africa by offering them free cigarettes, and calls upon 
            the Scottish Executive to press the relevant departments of Her Majesty’s
