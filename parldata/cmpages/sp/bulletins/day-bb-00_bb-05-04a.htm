    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="left">S1M-792</b> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Discipline in Schools</strong>&#151;That
      the Parliament believes that improved discipline in Scottish schools would contribute
      greatly to improved educational standards and would improve teacher morale; further
      believes that the introduction of targets to reduce the number of pupil exclusions can
      have a negative impact on discipline; recognises that a more flexible approach is required
      that puts faith in the judgement of headteachers to resolve individual cases on their
      merits, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to abandon its agenda of target setting for
      numbers of school exclusions in favour of an approach based on the needs of individual
      children, their peers and teachers backed up by appropriate resources to provide the
      diversity of educational provision and sanctions against bad behaviour that are required
      to improve discipline.<i><b> </p>

        exclusion from school and to integrate the support services for children and their
        families within the school setting, and welcomes the Executive&#146;s moves to encourage

        &quot;improved discipline&quot; to end and insert &quot;indiscipline in Scottish schools
        undermines efforts to improve educational standards for all children and damages teacher
        morale; believes that whilst exclusion of pupils from schools should always be a last
        resort, headteachers&#146; professional judgement must not be unduly restricted by the
        imposition of statistical targets for reducing exclusions; and calls upon the Scottish
        Executive to implement a national strategy for improving school discipline which includes
        an emphasis on the role of parents, improved teacher training, enhanced specialist
        provision in schools, increased numbers of learning and behavioural support teachers, a
        reduction in class sizes, and a constructive use of exclusions.&quot;<strong> </strong><i></p>

      <b><p ALIGN="left">S1M-790</b> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> <strong>Services for Elderly and Disabled
      People</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that many elderly and disabled citizens across
      Scotland feel let down by the Scottish Executive and its failure to deal with issues which
      most directly affect them; further notes that such citizens are being faced with
      escalating charges for variable social and other services provided by local authorities;
      believes that many local authorities are taking measures which restrict choice for the
      elderly in their selection of nursing or residential care; considers that a lack of local
      authority resources for nursing home places and a lack of co-ordination between health and
      social work has led to a 40% increase in bed blocking in the NHS since 1997; recognises
      that local authorities are systematically withdrawing financial support from facilities
      used by elderly and disabled citizens, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to abandon
      its agenda of political correctness and replace it with a programme that delivers to
      Scotland&#146;s elderly and disabled citizens affordable services, freedom of choice in
      care and the dignity and respect they deserve within our society.<i><b> </p>
