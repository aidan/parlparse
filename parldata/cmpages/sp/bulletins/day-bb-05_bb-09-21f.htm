          <p><strong>*S2M-3324</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Report of the Working Group on Debt Relief</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report of the Working Group on Debt Relief, established by the Scottish Executive; commends those involved, representing both creditor and debtor interests, for arriving at a series of positive recommendations to address the debt problems experienced by people with no income and no assets; notes the recommendation to provide a single gateway procedure for those without access to other forms of debt relief; considers that this will ensure that no person without income or assets will fall through the net, and therefore encourages the Executive to include the proposal in the forthcoming legislation to reform bankruptcy and diligence.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3323</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Children of Asylum Seekers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the trauma experienced by the children of asylum seekers when families are removed for deportation and the impact this has on school communities; believes that practices such as those reportedly used against the Vucaj family in Glasgow, including dawn raids, handcuffing of children and the removal of children by large groups of officers in uniform and body armour, are unnecessary and cause fear and distress to the children concerned; affirms its support for the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) which states that governments should protect children from all forms of physical or mental violence; recognises that, while the Scottish Executive has no direct responsibility for the operation of the asylum and immigration system, it is responsible for the welfare of children, for schools and for working with the UK Government to report on compliance with the UNCRC; commends the First Minister for his aspiration &quot;to ensure that no child is left behind or held back&quot;, and calls on him to give the greatest possible urgency to realising that aspiration for the most vulnerable children in Scotland who include those facing detention and removal.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-3322</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Peace Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and supports international world peace day on 21 September 2005; believes that the day should be marked in the Parliament in future years using Time for Reflection as a formal call for world peace, and calls on the Scottish Executive to institute an educational programme in every primary and secondary school to highlight world peace day and a national day of peace.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3321</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Economic Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the top priority of the Scottish Executive, as stated in the current Partnership Agreement, is &quot;growing the economy&quot; but reminds the Executive that GDP, its preferred measure of economic growth, makes no distinction between beneficial and harmful economic activity, ignores many socially beneficial and highly desirable practices and treats the depletion of natural capital as income and is therefore a very poor indicator of economic development; agrees with the Labour Party Policy Commission on the Environment that &quot;For too long, economic and political success has been measured solely in terms of the rate of growth of economic activity&quot;; considers, therefore, that if Scotland is to enjoy economic development that does not compromise social justice and environmental sustainability it needs a more meaningful yardstick than simply measuring the monetary value of goods and services produced in Scotland; remains committed to assisting the positive economic development of a healthy Scottish economy and considers that placing sustainability and national well-being at the heart of Executive policy will ultimately lead to a stronger, healthier and more innovative economic future for the people of Scotland, and urges the Executive to consider alternatives to GDP with a view to adopting a more suitable measure of national progress as its top priority.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3320</strong>u <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Promoting Energy Saving Using Micro and Small-Scale Renewable Technology</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that micro and small-scale renewable technology offers huge opportunities to tackle both fuel poverty and the causes of climate change; notes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s target of achieving a 20% improvement in energy efficiency on 2000 levels by 2010; believes that, to help achieve this target, building standards should be amended to include micro-renewable technology as permitted developments and should require generation capacity to be included in all new developments; particularly notes examples of good practice in Edinburgh Central such as Dunedin Canmore Housing Association&rsquo;s European award-nominated Slateford Green Development; believes that local authorities should be required to consider the role that micro-generation targets could deliver in achieving sustainable energy and to set appropriate targets accordingly; notes the Energy Savings Trust&rsquo;s proposal of a flat rate reduction on council tax or its replacement for houses which incorporate certified energy efficiency or micro-renewable technology, and believes that fiscal measures such as these should be actively considered.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3319</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle:</strong> <strong>Renewable Energy Opportunities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the view that Scotland should initiate more fuel projects based on oil-producing crops, thus helping to increase the energy supplied from sustainable sources as required by international obligations, particularly Kyoto; further welcomes the recent announcement by the Scottish Executive that farmers who wish to grow energy crops can now apply for grants of up to &pound;1,000 per hectare; notes that Scotland&rsquo;s only bio-fuel project, Argent, is a welcome start as it only recycles existing waste vegetable oils; notes that a new market for relevant crops would be a valuable new opportunity for Scottish farmers, and recognises that there are literally thousands of acres of uncropped land lying in set-aside which, if turned into production, could help to meet Scotland&rsquo;s sustainable energy targets.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3318</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Deprivation in Scottish Coalfield Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings contained within the Coalfields Communities Campaign&rsquo;s report, <em>Deprivation in Scottish Coalfield Communities</em>, which highlights that two-thirds of former mining communities have levels of deprivation above the Scottish average and that deprivation affects communities whose combined population is 600,000; calls on the Scottish Executive to make Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government, and in particular the Chancellor of the Exchequer, aware of the report, and further calls on the Executive and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to outline their action plan for former coalfield communities to ensure that such levels of deprivation and poverty are eradicated from communities in energy-rich Scotland.</p>
