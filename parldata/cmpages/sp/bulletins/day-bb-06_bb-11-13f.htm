<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5139</strong> <strong>Dave Petrie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Inverness Streetwork Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Streetwork Project in Inverness for the award it has received from Highland Council for the work it does in the city giving advice and support to homeless people; recognises the invaluable contribution which voluntary organisations such as Streetwork make in respect of the alleviation of homelessness; further recognises the need to increase the autonomy and financial security of the voluntary sector as a whole; recognises that homelessness has risen by 19% since 1999, and calls on the Scottish Executive to focus on effectively reversing this trend and to promote initiatives such as Streetwork in Inverness in other local authority areas throughout Scotland in a bid to provide the support necessary to ease the devastating homelessness figures which Scotland experiences.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5138</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Business Start-Up Grants</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the current Scottish Enterprise business start-up grant scheme for 18 to 30-year-olds discriminates unfairly against older applicants and, in particular, can place unnecessary barriers to growth by excluding from access to grant assistance applicants who would otherwise be sufficiently qualified and experienced to build thriving and successful businesses.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5137</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Support and Protection for Victims of Sex Crimes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the trauma caused to victims of sex abuse; recognises that counselling can help with this trauma and should be provided free to all victims of sex abuse and their families; calls for a dedicated counselling service for victims of sex abuse and their families to be established across the country; recognises that the process of giving evidence in sex abuse trials can add to the stress of victims and their families, and calls on the legal system to recognise this and to do all it can to reduce stress, including the provision of separate waiting areas for victims and families, and accused sex offenders and proper support services to victims and their families including full explanation of the court procedures and notification of court decisions.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5136</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Powerpod - Renewable Energy in a Box</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the young people from Edinburgh Woodcraft Folk youth group on the construction of the renewable energy trailer, Powerpod, being launched at the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, on Sunday 12 November 2006; supports this project, which is funded by the Scottish Executive and designed by young people for young people to promote the good news about the renewable energy alternatives that will help to address the climate change problems which are going to affect our present and future generations of young people, and recognises how important it is that young people themselves should play a part in taking such initiatives forward to face the problems of the century before us.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5135</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>UN Climate Talks in Nairobi, November 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the meeting of signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change taking place in Nairobi, Kenya, to discuss a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol which will expire in its current form in 2012; notes that this is the 12th set of UN climate talks since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit but that global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use all channels, including with the UK Government, to demand that the parties agree a new UN treaty to set binding targets for a cut in global atmospheric carbon emissions of 90% by 2050 to stave off the worst effects of climate change, that a new treaty must be based on the principle of &quot;contraction and convergence&quot; under which richer nations most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions have the greatest responsibility to reduce them, that the Kyoto Protocol is expanded to include aviation and shipping and that all industrialised countries sign the treaty, particularly the United States of America.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5134</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Keeping Young People Off the Streets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that it is vital to keep young people off the streets and provide activities that build their confidence and self-esteem and let them see that there are many ways to enjoy themselves, other than drug and alcohol misuse, and further agrees that the project, funded by Gretna Football Club and run by the First Base Agency in Dumfries, which provides football training for all over 16-year-olds and under-16s is the kind of model that should be funded by the Scottish Executive and rolled out across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5133</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Remains of Bothwell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the desire to repatriate from Denmark the remains of James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell and Duke of Orkney, consort to Mary Queen of Scots; notes that the remains of Tsarina Maria Fyodorovna, widow of Tsar Alexander III, have recently been removed from Denmark for internment in St Petersburg, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the UK Government to request that Bothwell&rsquo;s remains similarly are returned for reburial in his native Scotland, in accordance with the wishes of the Earl and his descendants around the world.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5131</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Integrated Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Services for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the misery caused by drug misuse in our communities; acknowledges that current and past policies of the Scottish Executive have failed, and calls on the Executive to implement, as a matter of urgency, a policy of integrated drug treatment and rehabilitation services across Scotland, such services to be based on a range of treatment options including family support, action on employability, substitute prescribing, and residential and community-based rehabilitation, all of these services to be based on a full assessment of individuals&rsquo; needs, through an individual care plan implemented and monitored by a key worker allocated to each individual and provided equally across the country.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5130</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Expressions of Sorrow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the attack on Beit Hanoun in Gaza perpetrated by Israel, which resulted in the killing of 18 people, including 8 children, all of them of the Athamnah family; echoes the comments of the European Union which termed the action as &quot;a profoundly shocking event&quot;, Egypt&rsquo;s foreign minister who referred to it as &quot;immoral and inhuman&quot; and the parliament of Kuwait which stated that the incident was one of &quot;organized terrorism&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Executive to issue a statement denouncing Israel&rsquo;s continued aggression in the middle east and expressing its deep-felt sorrow for the innocent families involved.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5129</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Stress: Biggest Workplace Problem</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes recent research by the Trades Union Congress indicating that stress is the biggest problem facing workplaces across Britain and that excessive workloads, job cuts, long hours, rapid change and bullying are the biggest contributory factors to rising stress problems among workers and further notes that stress has to be tackled through a legally enforceable shorter working week, to both relieve stress and create more job opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5128</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>City Bonuses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the latest estimate for City bonuses from the Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR) to the effect that total payouts are expected to reach a record of &pound;8.8 billion shared among high-flying City staff while the Office for National Statistics published low pay estimates for Spring 2006 which show that 336,000 working people are paid less than the national minimum wage; further notes the CEBR prediction that 4,200 City employees would receive a bonus of at least &pound;1 million, compared with 3,000 last year, and considers that such obscene levels of bonus payments illustrate the massive inequality of pay and income across Britain which is unacceptable and unproductive, and believes that a fundamental redistribution of wealth and income is required to improve social cohesion and the standard of life of millions currently condemned to life in poverty and that an independent socialist Scotland should never allow such obscene levels of inequality to scar our country.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5125</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Escalating Costs of the 2012 Olympic Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the organisers of the 2012 London Olympics are likely to be hit with a VAT bill on top of the cost of preparing for the games, originally estimated at &pound;2.4 billion and recently estimated at closer to &pound;5 billion; notes that this VAT bill, which Tessa Jowell MP has admitted was not factored into the original costs, may be around &pound;250 million alone; believes that Scottish charitable causes and grassroots sport should not be affected by either the increase in cost or the unexpected VAT bill by facing further displacement of lottery monies to contribute to these costs, and calls on the Scottish Executive to intimate this position clearly to both the organisers of the 2012 London Olympics and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5123</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Fireworks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing distress caused to residents and their pets by fireworks; recognises that restrictions on the sale of fireworks at New Year and for a three-week period prior to 5 November under the Fireworks Act 2003 do not prevent the abuse of fireworks at this time and during other times of the year when it is still too prevalent, and believes that the time has come to have a complete ban on the sale of fireworks, except for organised displays where a licence can be granted by local authorities.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5118</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Air Ambulance Cover in the Highlands and Islands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern reports that the Scottish Ambulance Service is trying to restrict the number of missions flown by its Inverness-based air ambulance helicopter by using the helicopter only when a road ambulance cannot access the site and even then only when authorisation is granted by the head of the air ambulance service; believes that such action will inevitably delay the arrival in hospital of patients in need of urgent medical treatment; further believes that this is the result of the reduction in the number of air ambulance aircraft in Scotland, in particular the loss of an air ambulance based in Orkney which has left the Inverness helicopter covering a much enlarged area, and calls on the Scottish Executive to instruct the Scottish Ambulance Service to base an additional air ambulance aircraft in Kirkwall as a matter of urgency so that adequate levels of air ambulance cover in the Highlands and Islands can be restored.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5096.1</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Future of Remploy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5096) in the name of Bruce Crawford, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the funding to Remploy has risen in recent years from &pound;96 million to &pound;119 million, with subsidies per supported worker ranging from &pound;18,000 to &pound;48,000; further notes that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government is committed to the future of Remploy and that, in&nbsp;a statement to the House of Commons on 19 July 2006, Anne McGuire MP, the UK Minister for Disabled People, announced that she will provide additional funding in this financial year to meet short-term pressures; welcomes the fact that a five-year funding envelope of &pound;555 million will be made available to enable the company to plan for the future, setting a new aspiration of helping a significantly greater number of disabled people into work and developing modernisation plans in consultation with trade unions and all stakeholders, with a commitment to protect Remploy&rsquo;s disabled employees from compulsory redundancy, and asks that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Scottish Executive review their procurement procedures to ensure compliance with Article 19 of the EU Directive on public sector procurement which provides particular protection in the procurement process for all sheltered workshops.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5095</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>The Watson-Watt Society of Brechin</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of the Watson-Watt Society of Brechin and congratulates the society on its plans to commemorate the work of Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the father of radar; notes that Sir Robert was born in Brechin and educated at Damacre School and Brechin High; acknowledges the enormous contribution Sir Robert made to the development of radar; recognises the importance of radar in our society through its use in weather forecasting, air traffic control, speed cameras, space travel and other uses, and encourages the Watson-Watt Society in its fund-raising efforts to establish a memorial to Sir Robert in Brechin as a tribute to the significance of his contribution to science in general and radar in particular.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5084.1</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Clydesdale Bank</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5084) in the name of Nora Radcliffe, leave out from second &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the commitment given by the bank to work with the Post Office; believes that this is a valuable contribution to securing business for rural post offices; deplores, however, Clydesdale Bank&rsquo;s decision to withdraw from almost all rural communities in north-east Scotland, and further notes that the bank has posted an increase in underlying profits of 16% which could have been used to maintain a service to its loyal customer base in Kincardineshire, Aberdeenshire, Banffshire and Moray.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4921</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4525#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>National Bed Assessment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde now has responsibility for a population of approximately one million; considers, therefore, that an urgent assessment is required of all numbers of beds, including high dependency and intensive care beds and those set aside for barrier nursing, since availability of every type of bed is crucial to the best clinical decisions and nursing care, as well as to the smooth and easy flow of the patient journey from one area of a hospital to another as their medical condition changes for better or worse; recognises that not having appropriate beds of any kind, in any speciality at any one time, can mean that a patient may have to stay in intensive care longer than necessary and thus block a bed for a patient who should be transferred from a high-dependency bed or theatre to an intensive care unit bed; acknowledges that delays to admission from casualty, accident and emergency or trauma departments may also be due to a lack of all types of beds being available, thus resulting in the discharge of patients in the evening in order to free a bed for an emergency admission; recognises that important elective procedures and operations may have to be cancelled at short notice as a result of no appropriate bed being available because of a general bed shortage, and therefore, in light of an increasingly ageing population with more complex conditions and in anticipation of a further rise of medical admissions including all types of infections, in particular MRSA, winter and summer vomiting viruses which often close wards, considers that work should be done to address our present problems within such a large NHS board and as a result decrease waiting times and lists.</p>
