            Women - 16 Days Campaign 2001, 25 November - 10 December 2001</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates and supports the Scottish women's groups 
            organising activities for the 16 Days Campaign 2001 which highlights 
            the issue of violence against women as a world-wide human rights issue 
            and aims to mobilise women as a social force, building an international 
            women's movement to demand women's rights in this context; notes that 
            over the 16 day period of the campaign its international nature will 
            be promoted with the theme &quot;Think Global - Act Local&quot;, and 
            further notes that flags from 14 different countries will be displayed

            secondary school teachers were encouraged into the profession by assurances 
            that age and experience would be recognised on qualification; is concerned 
            that the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers is considering 
            making changes to teachers' pay scales as they apply to probationary 
            and recently qualified staff which would impact significantly on the 
            situation of mature students; considers that these changes can only 
            have a generally detrimental impact on the national teacher recruitment 
            campaign; believes that the Scottish Executive should consider the 
            implications which such a proposal will have, particularly on mature 
            students who are currently part of the way through their training 
            and many of whom gave up well-paid careers, and recommends that such 
            students be given assurances that what they were promised will be 
            honoured. </p>

            ever science strategy, <i>A Science Strategy for Scotland</i>, including 
            encouragement of public interest in science; further notes with concern 
            the announcement of the imminent closure of the library, and expresses 
            the hope that the Executive will take action to prevent the library 
            from closing. </a></p>
