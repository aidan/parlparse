<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/index.htm"></a><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-190</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Violence in Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep concern about the state of emergency which has been declared on the Gaza Strip and the impact on Palestinians caught up in a nightmare of violence that has already resulted in more than 100 deaths; supports the call of the UK Foreign Secretary for all parties to the violence to agree an immediate ceasefire; acknowledges that the root of the problem is the poverty, isolation and hopelessness felt by the Palestinians living under 40 years of occupation and the failure of the international community to do more to bring about the creation of a Palestinian homeland, and calls on the international community to take the necessary steps to rebuild the peace process, bring an end to the occupation and work for a viable Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-189</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Mela and the Scottish Academy of Asian Arts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the return of one of the biggest events in Glasgow&rsquo;s cultural calendar, the Glasgow Mela; congratulates the organisers of the Glasgow Mela on its 17th annual celebration; notes the excellent work done by the Scottish Academy of Asian Arts in promoting the diverse culture and arts of the Asian continent; further notes the important role that the academy plays in bringing communities together, and wishes it well for future projects.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-188</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Case for Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the ongoing work being undertaken to evaluate the case for an Aberdeen Crossrail network providing enhanced train services between Aberdeen railway station, Aberdeen airport and communities north and south of the city; notes the inclusion of Aberdeen Crossrail in both the National Transport Strategy produced last year and the regional transport strategy published by NESTRANS; believes that Aberdeen Crossrail would bring significant economic and environmental benefits to the north-east region, and believes that the Scottish Executive should work with Transport Scotland to make a commitment to completing Aberdeen Crossrail within a defined timetable as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-187&diams; </strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Save the Land Reform Act and Restore the Will of Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the decision by Perth Sheriff Court to grant a declarator to Ann Gloag, owner of the Kinfauns Castle estate, which has the effect of denying the statutory right to roam over parts of the estate that was previously allowed under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003; notes that Perth and Kinross Council and the Ramblers Association opposed the declarator and gave evidence to the court that such a declarator would be contrary to the intention of the Act; believes that this decision undermines the clear will of the Parliament which legislated for the widest possible access to the countryside and that the court judgement ignores the significance of the Scottish Outdoor Access Code approved by MSPs to accompany and inform the operation of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, and considers that the judgement should be examined and appropriate action taken to give proper effect to the land reform legislation and, if necessary, to issue guidance to the courts on the status of the access code.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-186</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Peebles CAB</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of Peebles CAB, and indeed CABx across Scotland, for the invaluable free service they provide; notes that Peebles CAB, established in 1976, has in the last year dealt with 3,250 enquiries and won an estimated &pound;537,000 for clients and all with very limited resources but increasing demand on its services, and congratulates all staff and volunteers for this service.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-164</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Dynamic Teleswitched Tariff</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that some 200,000 consumers in Scotland are affected by Scottish Power&rsquo;s dynamic teleswitched tariff which, because of its complexities of metering and billing, effectively deprives them of choice as the difficulty and cost of operating these switches deters alternative suppliers from competing for customers; further notes that some of these consumers are on fixed and low incomes and that the lack of a realistic alternative also deprives consumers of choices such as online accounts, green tariffs or capped rates, and urges Ofgem to amend condition 32 of the standard licence conditions to stipulate the range and specific type of tariffs to be made available to consumers.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-163</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>EIS Call for Ban on Armed Forces Recruitment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the recent vote by the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), Scotland&rsquo;s largest teaching union, in passing a motion calling for a ban on Army recruitment campaigns in all schools.</p>
