          <P><strong>*S2M-632#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>North 
            and West Scotland Care Alliance</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the vital role performed by North and West Sutherland Care Alliance 
            through the provision of a home-based respite care service that brings 
            much-needed relief and assistance to carers and those vulnerable individuals 
            who would otherwise be unable to remain in their own homes and also 
            recognises that equitable and adequate funding of the North and West 
            Sutherland Care Alliance by both NHS Highland and Highland Council 
            is essential.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-631#</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of Post Offices in Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament condemns Royal 
            Mail for its decision to donate £1 million to London's bid for the 
            2012 Olympic Games at the same time as it is proposing to close 20 
            local post offices in Glasgow, in addition to the 11 already closed 
            since January 2003, and believes that the watchdog body, Postwatch 
            Scotland, should investigate as a matter of urgency whether this decision 
            represents value for money for Royal Mail's customers in Glasgow.</P>

            Legal Aid Board (Employment of Solicitors to Provide Criminal Legal 
            Assistance) Amendment Regulations 2003</strong>-That the Justice 2 
            Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Scottish 
            Legal Aid Board (Employment of Solicitors to Provide Criminal Legal 
            Assistance) Amendment Regulations 2003 (SSI 2003/511).</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-629#</strong> <strong>George Lyon:</strong> <strong>Medical 
            Services in the West Highlands</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the deep concern of the communities in Fort William and Oban regarding 
            the threat to future provision of acute medical services in the west 
            Highlands; notes that over 3,500 people, so far, have turned out at 
            public meetings to express their opposition to Argyll and Clyde and 
            Highland NHS boards' plans to downgrade Oban and Fort William hospitals 
            to community status; recognises that, if the proposals go ahead, patients 
            from the West Highlands would be forced to travel hundreds of miles 
            to Glasgow or Inverness to access treatment, and therefore believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should reject these plans and give a commitment 
            that the current service provision will continue to be delivered locally 
            to communities in the West Highlands.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-627.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Progress 
            in Respect of Fuel Poverty in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to

            &quot;endorses&quot; to &quot;programmes&quot; and insert &quot;notes 
            that in 2002 the Scottish Executive adopted a definition of fuel poverty 
            as being expenditure of more than 10% of household income on all household 
            fuel use, where household income included housing benefit and income 
            support for mortgage interest; notes that Energy Action Scotland recommended 
            that the Executive should adopt a measure of calculating household 
            income, excluding housing benefit and income support for mortgage 
            interest; notes that Energy Action Scotland estimated that 200,000 
            households would be re-classified out of fuel poverty as a result 
            of the definition adopted by the Executive; notes that in the first 
            six months of 2003, 10 times as many Scottish gas and electricity 
            customers were disconnected as in the whole of 2001; asks for improvements 
            to the Executive's Warm Deal programme to ensure that more vulnerable 
            households become eligible for assistance and that an appeals system 
            is adopted which does not deter low income households from challenging 
            the decisions of the private contractors, Eaga Partnership Ltd.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-627.2</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Progress

            &quot;and recognises that the single biggest contributor to a reduction 
            in fuel poverty was the privatisation of the utilities by Conservative 
            governments at Westminster.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-627.3</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Progress

            motion (S2M-627) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from 
            &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that in energy 
            rich Scotland one in six households are still suffering fuel poverty, 
            and believes that in order to help meet the Scottish Executive's commitment 
            to eradicate fuel poverty by 2016, the central heating programme should 
            be extended to families with young children, people with disabilities 
            and pensioners with inadequate heating.&quot;</P>

            in fuel poverty figures in the Scottish House Condition Survey 2002, 
            notes that this derives in part from factors outwith the Scottish 
            Executive's control; considers that addressing home energy efficiency 
            is the most effective way to tackle fuel poverty in addition to helping 
            Scotland meet climate change targets; and calls on the Executive to 
            adopt a single and consistent definition of fuel poverty such as used 
            in the Scottish Fuel Poverty Statement, and further calls on the Executive 
            to commit itself to recognised objective standards for home energy 
            efficiency as used in the Scottish House Condition Survey.&quot;</P>

            end and insert &quot;notes that socialism has caused more poverty 
            and human misery than any other political ideology in modern history; 
            further notes that socialist policies, where implemented, have singularly 
            failed to remedy the lack of economic growth that is the root cause 
            of poverty; believes that the best way to tackle poverty is to create 
            a strong, dynamic, free enterprise economy with opportunity for all, 
            and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to reduce business 
            rates and ease the burden of water charges on Scottish business thereby 
            taking the first steps towards improving the Scottish economy.&quot;</P>

            that the unacceptable poverty of the poorest in our society would 
            come to be shared by more of our citizens than at present.&quot;</P>

            services, particularly in education and health, and through supporting

            President of the United States of America, recognises the close ties 
            that have existed between governments and peoples of the UK and USA 
            in times of world war, cold war and peace, and believes that without

            &quot;regrets the State visit to the UK by George W Bush at a time

            the decision by George W Bush and Tony Blair to pursue an illegal 
            war in Iraq on the basis of false and misleading information; considers 
            that US military command in Iraq should be passed to the United Nations 
            and that the process of handing over control of the country to a democratic 
            government should be accelerated in the interests of the Iraqi people 
            rather than the re-election prospects of George W Bush; believes that 
            the total disregard of the current US administration for the views 
            of the international community, as illustrated by its stance on Iraq, 
            the Kyoto Treaty, the International Criminal Court and its abuse of 
            human rights at Guantanamo Bay, poses a threat to world peace, and

            recognises the opportunity presented by the visit to make clear the 
            public's wish that those who initiated the war have a duty, under 
            the supervision of the UN, to make Iraq safe and give its people the 
            opportunity of a democratic future, that the British citizens in Guantanamo

            Legislation - Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill</strong>-As an 
            amendment to motion (S2M-543) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, insert 
            at end &quot;but, in so doing, expresses its concerns over several 
            provisions contained in the Bill, namely those relating to national 
            security, urgency and enforcement; believes that these provisions 
            could face objectors with a greater disadvantage in Crown planning 
            cases than they are faced with in private planning cases, and considers 
            that the UK Parliament should address these issues during its consideration 
            of the Bill.&quot;</P>
