          <p><strong>*S2M-1840#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Science and the Parliament Event, 10 November 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Science and the Parliament 2004 event being held on 10 November 2004, organised by the Royal Society of Chemistry in association with Scotland&rsquo;s leading science organisations; notes the contribution of Scotland&rsquo;s 40,000 scientists to our economic, environmental and social development; notes that Scotland is a world leader in many scientific disciplines;&nbsp;further notes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s efforts to foster an environment that enhances pupil and student participation in science, to invest in the science infrastructure and equipment of our educational establishments, to increase investment in research along with supporting greater industrial research and assist in the practical application of our world-beating research, and welcomes the review of the Executive&rsquo;s review,&nbsp;<em>A Science Strategy for Scotland.</em></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1839</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Opposition to Scottish Executive Funding of Talisman Energy Inc. Windfarm</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Scottish Executive to allocate &pound;3 million for an offshore wind farm to Talisman Energy Inc., a company that has been associated with human rights abuses in Sudan, including killing, bombing and looting, in order to open up oilfields; applauds the actions of the Presbyterian Church of Sudan and 15 other tribesmen and women, who claim they were forced from their homes in and around Talisman oil fields, in bringing a human rights case against Talisman; calls on the Executive to review its funding procedures and criteria as a matter of urgency, and further calls on the Executive to initiate the development of ethical criteria as a priority for all future planning and funding decisions.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1838</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Flying of Flags from the Scottish Parliament Building</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the flying of flags from public buildings, as is custom and practice throughout the world, helps to promote national and international identity and should be encouraged, not just on certain days but at all times, and therefore resolves to set an example by flying the Saltire, the Union flag and the European Union flag from the Scottish Parliament building.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Farquhar Munro<strong>*</strong>, George Lyon<strong>*</strong>, Mike Rumbles<strong>*</strong>, Jeremy Purvis<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong>, Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Smith<strong>*</strong>, Mr Keith Raffan<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1837#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Diabetes in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the rising numbers of people with diabetes in Scotland as evidenced in the recent report from Diabetes UK Scotland, <em>Diabetes in Scotland and the UK 2004</em>, which shows that there are 148,000 people in Scotland diagnosed with diabetes, a rise of 28,000 since 1996; is concerned that at least 65,000 people in Scotland are undiagnosed, as highlighted in the report, and that this number is rising year-on-year; recognises that diabetes is associated with chronic ill-health, disability and premature mortality and that long-term complications, including heart disease, strokes, blindness, kidney disease and amputations, make the greatest contribution to the costs of diabetes care, and believes that many of these long-term effects could be avoided with earlier identification and more effective treatment.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1836</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>National Celebration of Gaelic</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the city of Perth on being the venue for this year&rsquo;s Royal National Mod and hopes that this year&rsquo;s event will be as successful as last year&rsquo;s Centenary Mod in Oban; notes that this year&rsquo;s Mod, the most important cultural event for Gaeldom and a significant national icon, takes place against the welcome background of a debate about the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill which the Scottish Executive has recently introduced, and expresses the hope that the nation will now take the opportunity to recognise the immense and enduring contribution to Gaelic and Scotland&rsquo;s literary reputation throughout Europe of the work of the late Gaelic bard Sorley Maclean of Raasay through the establishment of a fitting permanent memorial, of which a scholarship to assist young Gaelic speakers could be a key part.</p>
