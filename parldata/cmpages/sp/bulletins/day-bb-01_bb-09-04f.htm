          <p><strong>*S1M-2157</strong> <strong>Mr John Farquhar Munro: Sodexho and Asylum Seekers</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the contents of the article published in <i>The 
            Observer </i>on 2 September 2001 and the allegations therein relating 
            to Sodexho and its subsidiary companies; further notes that the allegations 
            relate to the exploitation of asylum seekers, one of the most vulnerable 
            groups in the UK, and suggest that a subsidiary of Sodexho is guilty 
            of paying asylum seekers the equivalent of 34p an hour for their work; 
            abhors any attempts made by any company in the UK to avoid paying 
            the minimum wage to any employee, whether they be citizens of the 
            UK or not; is concerned that Sodexho is responsible for providing 
            catering services to the Parliament and that the Parliament should 
            be setting a good example to the rest of the nation in terms of ethical 
            employment practices, and therefore urges the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body (a) to enter into urgent negotiations with Sodexho 
            to ensure that, if these allegations are found to be true, any unfair 
            or unethical working practices used by the company or any of its subsidiaries 
            cease immediately, particularly where they relate to the employment 
            of vulnerable groups and (b), if Sodexho refuse to met these demands, 
            to immediately revoke its contract for the provision of catering services 
            to the Scottish Parliament.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2156</strong> <strong>Angus MacKay: Protection from Abuse (Scotland) 
            Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>-That the Parliament, for the purposes 
            of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Protection 
            from Abuse (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure 
            payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the 
            Act.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace<strong>*</strong>, Iain Gray<strong>*</strong>, Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2155</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson: Efficiency of Transport Divisions 
            of the Scottish Executive Development Department</strong>-That the Parliament 
            is deeply concerned by the series of errors, fiascos and poor policy 
            making and administration within the transport divisions of the Scottish 
            Executive Development Department and is concerned that the current 
            Erskine Bridge tolls fiasco, with the resultant disruption to the 
            Parliament's business programme, has followed on from the major problems 
            in the award of the trunk road maintenance contract, chaos in their 
            policy on road tolling and a general perception that the transport 
            divisions are in a mess; is further concerned that the same divisions 
            which have handled transport policy and implementation so badly cannot 
            be trusted in their current form to handle the forthcoming tendering 
            process for Scotland's Cal-Mac ferry routes in an effective and efficient 
            manner, and therefore calls on the Minister for Transport to take 
            control of her divisions and bring forward a comprehensive and independent 
            review of their structure and function with a view to proposing the 
            necessary reforms required to improve their work.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2154</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Cannabis Experiment</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that the experiment on policing of cannabis 
            in Brixton should be implemented in Scotland as a first step towards 
            decriminalising the personal use and possession of cannabis and eventually 
            legalising it.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2153</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Dangers of "Soapbar" Cannabis</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that the widespread sale and use in Scotland 
            of &quot;soapbar&quot; instead of pure cannabis give rise to serious 
            concerns about the health of cannabis users and that it therefore 
            makes sense to legalise the sale of cannabis for personal use so that 
            the quality of cannabis can be subject to legal scrutiny and these 
            concerns properly addressed.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2152</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Responsibility for Drugs Policy</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that responsibility for 
            all issues relating to illegal drugs in Scotland should be within 
            the remit of the Scottish Parliament, given that this area involves 
            aspects of health, justice, crime and social recreation, all of which 
            are devolved matters.</p>
