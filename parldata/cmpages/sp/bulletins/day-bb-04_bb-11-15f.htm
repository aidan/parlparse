          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1999</strong> <STRONG>Pauline McNeill:</STRONG> <STRONG>Glasgow - A Fair Trade City</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the investigation undertaken by Glasgow City Council in order to achieve fair trade status; commends the growing awareness of people in Scotland of the issues surrounding fair trade and the desire to be involved in such a positive way to tackle the injustice of poverty, and recognises the ongoing importance of fair trade as an effective way of empowering disadvantaged producers through receiving a fairer deal.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1998#</strong> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Encouraging School Debating</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the great benefits that school debating can offer to students; believes that debate develops powers of argument, increases understanding, boosts critical thinking and promotes engagement with society; considers that students who take part in debating show stronger communication skills, raised self-esteem, are better at working in teams, become more articulate and objective and are likely to be better equipped to become active citizens; believes that the opportunity to take part in debate can have a real impact on the life-chances of young people, particularly of those from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds; supports the work of the English-Speaking Union (ESU), with schools throughout Scotland, in promoting and organising debate; notes that its National Juniors Debating Competition has attracted more than eighty entries from schools across the country, and welcomes the innovative new debating outreach programme that the ESU is launching in January 2005 in conjunction with North Lanarkshire Council.</p>

          <p><STRONG>S2M-1996</strong> <STRONG>Pauline McNeill:</STRONG> <STRONG>Yasser Arafat</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament extends its deepest condolences to the Palestinian people for the very sad loss of their leader, President Yasser Arafat, who retained popular and unified support across Palestinian communities for 30 years; believes that President Arafat should be remembered for making the world aware of the existence and the struggle of the Palestinians as a people displaced from their homeland, and further believes that the most lasting tribute to Yasser Arafat would be international effort to ensure a viable independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to ensure the right of return of Palestinian refugees.</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1995#</strong> <STRONG>Jackie Baillie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Employability Programmes for Vulnerable Groups</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success of the New Futures Fund Initiative in providing early employability programmes for people who are furthest from the labour market, including those with addiction problems, the homeless and ex-offenders; acknowledges that 21% of participants entered employment, 14% entered training programmes, 12% entered further education and 10% engaged in voluntary work; notes that the funding of the initiative ends in March 2005, and considers that the Scottish Executive should put in place a long-term strategy to provide the most vulnerable adults with effective routes out of the problems they face by providing easy access to employability programmes.</p>

          <p> <STRONG>S2M-1994</strong> <STRONG>Christine Grahame:</STRONG> <STRONG>Closure of Hutton and Burnmouth Primary Schools</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision on 11 November 2004 to close Hutton, with a roll of 12, and Burnmouth, with a roll of 18, primary schools in Roxburghshire and Berwickshire in the face of fierce resistance from parents; further notes with concern that these closures will tear the heart out of these communities; believes that these proposed closures must be referred to the Minister for Education and Young People, and urges him to reject these closures which are not in the interests of the children or the community.</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1993#</strong> <STRONG>Rob Gibson:</STRONG> <STRONG>Membership of the Convention of the Highlands and Islands</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should extend invitations to future meetings of the Convention of the Highlands and Islands so as to include all MSPs elected in the area and should afford them full speaking rights.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Roseanna Cunningham<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Stewart Stevenson<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Eleanor Scott<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Dr Jean Turner<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mr Stewart Maxwell<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Ms Sandra White<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Jim Mather<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Bruce Crawford<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Robin Harper<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Christine Grahame<STRONG>*</strong></p>

          <p>Supported by: David McLetchie, Alex Johnstone<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mike Pringle<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mr Jamie McGrigor<STRONG>*</STRONG>, John Swinburne<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mr Kenneth Macintosh<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Bruce Crawford<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Robin Harper<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Richard Baker<STRONG>*</STRONG>, John Scott<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Margaret Smith<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mr David Davidson<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Murdo Fraser<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>S2M-1991</strong> <STRONG>Mike Rumbles:</STRONG> <STRONG>Ban on Smoking in Enclosed Public Places</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the intention of the Scottish Executive to introduce a ban on smoking in enclosed public places; recognises that the Executive has already acted to make its buildings smoke-free; believes that the Parliament should lead by example and make its building a smoke-free area, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to reconsider its decision to allow smoking on the premises.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone, Mike Pringle, Iain Smith, Jeremy Purvis, Eleanor Scott, Michael McMahon, Mr John Swinney, John Swinburne, Stewart Stevenson, Bristow Muldoon</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1991.1</strong> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Ban on Smoking in Enclosed Public Places</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1991) in the name of Mike Rumbles, leave out from &quot;the Executive&quot; to end and insert &quot;the Parliament staff smoking room is just that, a staff smoking room and, as such, is not an enclosed public place; notes that it is ventilated and has double doors, and believes that, as the Parliament does not have jurisdiction over employment legislation and workplace smoking bans, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should continue to allow members of the Parliament and all employees the choice of whether or not to use the smoking room.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1990</strong> <STRONG>Irene Oldfather:</STRONG> <STRONG>Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the UK Government is a signatory and strong supporter of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC); welcomes the fact that France, Hungary, Malta and Slovenia have now ratified the treaty; regrets that other EU Member States have not yet formally endorsed the principles of the FCTC; urges the Scottish Executive to do all that it can in discussion with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to encourage formal ratification which would act as a catalyst to other member states; notes that the FCTC calls on its signatories to eliminate the illicit trade in tobacco products, end tobacco advertising and ban tobacco sales to and by minors; further notes that the principles of the FCTC are endorsed by the Executive&rsquo;s policy as set out in the Tobacco Action Plan, and recognises that the global application of the FCTC will result in reducing the number of people who die as a result of smoking-related illnesses each year.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Jackie Baillie</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1989</strong> <STRONG>Helen Eadie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Superfast Receives Best Ferry Award</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the ongoing success story of the passenger and freight Superfast ferry service operating from Fife with its record levels of sea freight transport; congratulates Yannis Criticos, Superfast board member and project director of North Sea and Superfast Ferries on being voted Best Ferry Operator by the Scottish Passenger Agents&rsquo; Association (SPAA), which is the oldest travel trade association in the world, established in 1921, and further notes that around 700 travel agents in Scotland associated with the SPAA voted for the award and that Superfast held off competition from Stena Line, SeaCat, DFDS Seaways and P&amp;O Ferries to scoop the top award.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Christine May, Marilyn Livingstone, Nora Radcliffe, Tricia Marwick, Sarah Boyack, Murdo Fraser, Roseanna Cunningham, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Mike Pringle, Jackie Baillie, Scott Barrie, Mrs Mary Mulligan, Phil Gallie<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mr Jamie Stone<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>S2M-1988</strong> <STRONG>Michael McMahon on behalf of the Public Petitions Committee:</STRONG> <STRONG>Public Petition PE535</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes public petition PE535 calling for the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Executive to (a) conduct an inquiry into past institutional child abuse, in particular for those children who were in the care of the state under the supervision of religious orders and (b) make an unreserved apology for the said state bodies and to urge the religious orders to apologise unconditionally.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Scott, Campbell Martin</p>

          <p>Supported by: Jackie Baillie</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1986#</strong> <STRONG>John Scott:</STRONG> <STRONG>Waiting Lists for Access to Free Personal Care</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned to note that South Ayrshire Council has been required to operate a waiting list policy for the delivery of free personal care to older people who have been assessed as being eligible for such care; believes that, given the commitment made by the Scottish Executive to fully fund the provision of free personal care, the existence of waiting lists is incompatible with this commitment, and considers that financial allocations should be increased to those local authorities whose existing allocations are insufficient to meet assessed demand for free personal care.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Adam Ingram, Margaret Mitchell, Alex Johnstone, Eleanor Scott, John Swinburne, Carolyn Leckie, Campbell Martin, Chris Ballance, Ms Sandra White, Mr David Davidson, Phil Gallie<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mr Ted Brocklebank<STRONG>*</strong></p>

          <p>Supported by: Marilyn Livingstone, Mr David Davidson, Sarah Boyack, Marlyn Glen, Eleanor Scott, Ms Sandra White, Dr Elaine Murray, Jackie Baillie, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Mrs Mary Mulligan, Frances Curran<STRONG>*</STRONG>, John Scott<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mr Jamie Stone<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>S2M-1983</strong> <STRONG>Mr Mark Ruskell:</STRONG> <STRONG>National Farmers Union Scotland and Fair Trade</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the National Farmers Union Scotland in its campaign for fair trade with supermarkets; is alarmed at the power of supermarkets to dictate prices below production costs of milk and other products; agrees that a code of practice for retailers needs to be made compulsory and enforceable and that a lack of contracts between supermarkets, processors and suppliers is a major problem that needs to be rectified; believes that there should be a fair trade inquiry into the practices engaged in by supermarkets in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to report on the effect such practices have on the rural economy and environment and the livelihoods of people and communities dependent on agriculture.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie, Alex Neil, Robin Harper, Colin Fox, Eleanor Scott, George Lyon, Shiona Baird, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Mr John Swinney, Trish Godman</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1981</strong> <STRONG>Alex Fergusson:</STRONG> <STRONG>National Beef Envelope</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision to introduce a national beef envelope as part of the reform of Common Agricultural Policy, despite the overwhelming objections to such a measure by the majority of stakeholders; believes that the decision should be reviewed after one year with a view to abolishing the measure and, if the measure is not then abolished, the criteria should be altered to include beef from the dairy herd, and notes that the dairy sector will be contributing to the scheme through modulation whilst deriving no benefit from it, thus further disadvantaging a sector at a time when its financial returns are at an all-time low.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Scott, Phil Gallie, David Mundell, Stewart Stevenson, Alex Johnstone, Margaret Mitchell, Mr David Davidson, Alex Neil<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>S2M-1978</strong> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Co-operation between Parliament and Civil Servants</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Scottish Executive to form a working group composed of representatives of MSPs, ministers and civil servants to examine ways in which the Parliament and Executive ministers and civil servants could work together constructively, possibly in smaller specialist groups, to develop policy, improve public services, promote economic activity and community life and raise the quality of life, without compromising parties&rsquo; right to take up different positions and criticise each other, the independence of the Parliament and the Executive or the particular relationship between ministers and civil servants.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Farquhar Munro, Mike Pringle, Robin Harper, Shiona Baird</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1977</strong> <STRONG>Margaret Smith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Edinburgh Airport Rail Link</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament supports a comprehensive rail link to Edinburgh Airport; recognises that the consultation period has started and welcomes the opportunity for people to input their views; believes that value for money and impact of construction concerns must be taken into account; nonetheless believes that direct rail links to Edinburgh Airport from Fife, Glasgow and other parts of Scotland have the potential to benefit the local, regional and national economy, increase the number of people travelling by public transport to the airport, reduce congestion, improve integrated transport in west Edinburgh and tackle pollution; therefore condemns the Scottish Green Party&rsquo;s opposition to the airport rail link; believes that its policy of renationalising the railways is not a current remedy for tackling congestion or air pollution, and further believes that it is the delivery of new and improved public transport links that will improve Scotland&rsquo;s environment.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David McLetchie, Mike Pringle, Helen Eadie, Maureen Macmillan, Robert Brown, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Iain Smith, Sarah Boyack, Nora Radcliffe, George Lyon, Mrs Mary Mulligan</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1976</strong> <STRONG>Margaret Mitchell:</STRONG> <STRONG>Just One Click in Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the one-day conference held on 9 November 2004 by Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland aimed at promoting the safety of children online; congratulates Barnardo&rsquo;s for continuing to highlight this important issue and spread awareness of the dangers; notes that there is a lack of available data about the extent of internet grooming in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to undertake research into the scale of the problem and to carry out a high-profile awareness campaign alerting parents and young people to the dangers of grooming over the internet and mobile phones.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame, Alex Johnstone, Shiona Baird, Ms Sandra White, Murray Tosh, Chris Ballance, Roseanna Cunningham, Richard Lochhead, Mr Ted Brocklebank, Murdo Fraser, Bill Aitken, Phil Gallie, Bruce Crawford, Rob Gibson, John Scott, Robin Harper, Mrs Nanette Milne, Eleanor Scott, Mr Brian Monteith, Alex Neil, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Mr David Davidson, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Alex Fergusson</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1975</strong> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Midlothian Council's Proposals to Boundary Commission</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament views with concern Midlothian Council&rsquo;s proposals to the Boundary Commission for six wards of three members each in respect of the new STV elections for local government; believes that this will not deliver proportionality in the spirit of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, and would express regret if this proposal represented an attempt by the Scottish Labour Party to subvert proportionality for local government.</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-1974</strong> <STRONG>Mr Tom McCabe:</STRONG> <STRONG>The Draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2004 Amendment (No.2) Order 2004</STRONG>&mdash;That the Finance Committee recommends that the draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2004 Amendment (No.2) Order 2004 be approved.</p>

          <p><STRONG>S2M-1971</strong> <STRONG>Trish Godman:</STRONG> <STRONG>Overcrowding on Scottish Train Services</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament is seriously concerned at the abject failure of ScotRail officials to address the serious problem of gross overcrowding of trains in Scotland and, especially, on the commuter train running from Glasgow to Edinburgh; believes that this cramming of passengers into trains is, at worst, a potential safety hazard of some magnitude and, at best, a source of serious discomfort and stress, especially to elderly and disabled passengers and that it acts as a powerful deterrent to those who would travel on public transport if they could be guaranteed a level of comfort that equals the standards to be found in most European Union member states and Scandinavian countries, and calls on the Scottish Executive to engage in discussions with senior officials of ScotRail in order to enhance the safety and comfort of rail passengers in Scotland.</p>

          <p><STRONG>S2M-1969</strong> <STRONG>Christine Grahame:</STRONG> <STRONG>&quot;Wear a Hat Day&quot; (and possibly gloves, coat and scarf)</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes and congratulates Age Concern on its initiative, Wear a Hat Day, on 3 December 2004 to raise funds to publicise, and raise the profile of, the devastating impact of cold weather on the health and well-being of older people; recognises that hypothermia is a silent killer and that older people may not realise how cold they have become until it is too late; while applauding this initiative in fighting the freeze, expresses anger that it is necessary in an energy-rich nation such as Scotland, where the predicted figures for admissions to hospital from hypothermia for the current year for people aged 65 and upwards is 115, the figures for excess winter mortality in the year 2002-03 were 2510, 37% of single pension households, comprising 128,000 households, are classed as fuel poor and Scotland falls well behind the Scandinavian nations in ensuring that winter deaths are minimised; notes the substantial impact rising fuel prices have on those on a fixed income such as a pension, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to enter into discussions with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government with regard to abolishing the means-tested pension credit which 48% of those entitled to claim in Scotland do not claim and which, in any event, is unjust, with a view to providing a pension that will bring an end to pensioner fuel poverty and make &quot;wear a hat&quot; days superfluous.</p>

          <p> <STRONG>S2M-1914.1</strong> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Voting Irregularities in the US Presidential Elections</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1914) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the US Presidential Elections have been conducted with minimal disruption and with a record turnout in six states as over 120 million people across America exercised their right to vote; considers this a tremendous success in contrast to the first elections to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 when considerably long delays were experienced as over 2000 votes went uncounted in Lothians and votes in the City of Edinburgh Council elections were similarly uncounted; notes the increase in turnout in the United States of America with 60% of the electorate casting a ballot in comparison with the reduced Scottish Parliament turnout in 2003 of 49%, and considers it inappropriate in the circumstances to suggest that the United States has anything to learn from MSPs on the conduct of a full and fair democratic election.&quot;</p>

          <p> <STRONG>S2M-1912#</strong> <STRONG>Roseanna Cunningham:</STRONG> <STRONG>Pools Companies Holding Scottish Football to Ransom</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the decision by Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters football pools companies to cease payment to the Scottish Football League (SFL) of copyright payments for the right to use SFL fixtures in their pools games; notes that, for this season, the SFL was scheduled to receive around &pound;600,000, which would have meant an income of some &pound;20,000 for each club; recognises that 20% of the SFL&rsquo;s commercial income comes from this source and that this decision will have a major impact on the finances of every member club of the SFL, and therefore believes that the three pools companies should reverse the decision.</p>

          <p> <STRONG>S2M-1837#</strong> <STRONG>Karen Whitefield:</STRONG> <STRONG>Diabetes in Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the rising numbers of people with diabetes in Scotland as evidenced in the recent report from Diabetes UK Scotland, <EM>Diabetes in Scotland and the UK 2004</EM>, which shows that there are 148,000 people in Scotland diagnosed with diabetes, a rise of 28,000 since 1996; is concerned that at least 65,000 people in Scotland are undiagnosed, as highlighted in the report, and that this number is rising year-on-year; recognises that diabetes is associated with chronic ill-health, disability and premature mortality and that long-term complications, including heart disease, strokes, blindness, kidney disease and amputations, make the greatest contribution to the costs of diabetes care, and believes that many of these long-term effects could be avoided with earlier identification and more effective treatment.</p>
