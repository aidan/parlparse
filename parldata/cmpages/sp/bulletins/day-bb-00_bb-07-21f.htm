            Godman: Community Gardens</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the value 
            of community gardening in improving health, building communities, 
            increasing bio-diversity and promoting regeneration, while providing 
            refreshment and healthy recreation for those without a garden; notes 
            that such gardens face fierce competition for space in urban areas, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive to help to secure the future 
            of community gardens through revised planning guidance and by promoting 
            them through the New Opportunities Fund.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1106</strong> <strong>Ian Jenkins: Sydney 2000 and 
            European Cup Athletics</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates all the 
            Scottish athletes who contributed to remarkable British successes 
            at the European cup at Gateshead; welcomes the progress made by the 
            Scottish Executive in developing community sports facilities, and 
            wishes the Great Britain team well in the forthcoming Sydney Olympic 
            Games.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1105</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Vehicle Body 
            Repair Specialists and VAT</strong>-That the Parliament calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            to end the discrimination suffered by those vehicle body repair specialists 
            which are not owned by insurance companies and which therefore do 
            not enjoy exemption from VAT on labour; notes that this places the 
            independent repair shops at a severe competitive disadvantage, and 
            further calls upon the Executive to investigate whether this constitutes 
            an infringement of EU law and competition policy or is open to challenge 
            at the behest of the Competition Commission or otherwise.</font></p>
