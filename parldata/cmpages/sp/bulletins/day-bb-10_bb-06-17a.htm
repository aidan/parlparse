<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Labour Party Debate: Schools&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-6580 Des McNulty: Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the reduction in the numbers of teachers and classroom assistants since 2007 and the sharp rise in the proportion of newly qualified teachers who cannot obtain permanent or even temporary employment; further notes the widespread disquiet that exists among teachers and parents over the lack of preparedness for implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence and, in particular, the lack of clarity over new qualification arrangements; recognises that the Curriculum for Excellence is a wide-ranging reform with significant resource implications, and calls on the Scottish Government to reach an early agreement with local authorities and teachers organisations that guarantees the necessary preparation time and resources for successful implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-6580.3 Michael Russell: Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6580) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &quot;or even&quot; to end and insert &quot;employment; further notes the unanimous recommendation of the Curriculum for Excellence Management Board, including the representatives of the major teaching unions, that implementation in secondary schools should begin in August 2010; notes the announcement of a 10-point plan to support implementation including an additional &pound;3 million, tailored help for secondary schools that need it, increased training for teachers and improved practical materials; recognises that the Curriculum for Excellence embodies the cross-party recommendations of the 2002 report by the Education, Culture and Sport Committee into the purposes of education, and calls on the Scottish Government to listen to teachers&rsquo; and parents&rsquo; concerns over the new curriculum and reach an early agreement with local authorities and teachers organisations that guarantees the necessary preparation time and resources for successful implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-6580.1 Elizabeth Smith: Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6580) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;, and deplores the threat of industrial action by some teaching unions, which will impact adversely on many of the extra-curricular activities that take place out of school hours and that are such an essential part of the wider educational experience for so many young people.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-6580.2 Margaret Smith: Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6580) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;, and notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s package of education failures includes the abandonment of SNP election commitments to reduce class sizes in P1 to P3 to 18, dump student debt and match brick for brick the previous administration&rsquo;s school building programme.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>

<p><strong>2.55 pm</strong> Ministerial Statement: Supporting Young People in the Context of the Economic Climate</p>
<p><strong>3.25 pm</strong> Scottish Government Debate: Poverty Framework&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-6581 Alex Neil: Poverty Framework</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing approach set out in the ScottishGovernment&rsquo;s poverty and income inequality framework, <em>Achieving our Potential</em>, to take long-term measures to tackle drivers of poverty and income inequality in Scotland, to maximise the potential for people to work, to make work pay for those who can and to support those who cannot work and those who are experiencing poverty now; recognises the need to focus on those people and communities who experience longer-term persistent poverty, and supports the need to streamline the welfare system while ensuring that reforms provide better protection for, and do not further disadvantage, vulnerable people, particularly in these challenging times. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-6581.2 Johann Lamont: Poverty Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6581) in the name of Alex Neil, leave out from &quot;to take&quot; to end and insert &quot;; further notes the findings of research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust that child, pensioner and overall poverty fell faster in Scotland than in any other part of the United Kingdom during the period of the previous UK administration, led by Labour, but notes concerns raised by anti-poverty organisations, such as Save the Children and the Poverty Alliance, that single outcome agreements do not give sufficient priority to meeting shared poverty targets and have created further problems in terms of monitoring progress and accountability; therefore urges the Scottish Government to review the impact of the concordat and single outcome agreements to ensure a clearer focus on reducing poverty and that measures are put in place to monitor progress made at the national level, and further, in this European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion and given the critical role for the Scottish Government in tackling poverty, calls on it to report to the Parliament detailing how it will use all the powers at its disposal to tackle poverty and disadvantage.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-6581.1 Jeremy Purvis: Poverty Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6581) in the name of Alex Neil, insert at end &quot;, and believes that the Scottish Government should introduce a fairer pay policy that gives a real-terms pay increase to those on the lowest wages in the public sector while paying no bonuses to higher earning staff in 2010-11 and 2011-12.&quot; </p>

  <p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-6195 Pauline McNeill: Securing the Future of Glasgow&rsquo;s Subway</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Strathclyde Partnership for Transport&rsquo;s decision to go ahead with its modernisation plan; recognises the important role that the subway plays in Glasgow&rsquo;s transport infrastructure and its significance to Scotland, carrying an estimated 14 million passengers annually; notes that this will be the first major investment project for the service since the 1970s, and hopes that the proposals receive the support that they need to go ahead and that the modernisation keeps Glasgow moving into the future.</p>
