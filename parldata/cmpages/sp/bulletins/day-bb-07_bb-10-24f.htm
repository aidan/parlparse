          <p><strong>*S3M-681</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Alcohol</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Scotland&rsquo;s first Alcohol Awareness Week and endorses the partnership approach between the government, industry and the voluntary sector to educate consumers about alcohol units, while recognising that further work is needed to ensure that alcohol is accepted as different to any other product for sale; further agrees that tackling the problems surrounding the misuse of alcohol is one of the great social and public health challenges of our time, requiring direct, innovative, long term and sustained action; recognises that this includes tougher enforcement action against those who sell and promote alcohol irresponsibly; notes the importance of close co-operation with, and support of, Scotland&rsquo;s police forces and licensing boards in this respect; welcomes the recent commitments by the Scottish Government to regulate the display and promotion of alcohol in off-sales premises and to find a method of ensuring that those licensees who profit from Scotland&rsquo;s alcohol culture help offset the damage done by that culture, as well as to develop a long-term strategy to tackle the negative effects of alcohol misuse, and further notes the need for the NHS to play its part in early identification and intervention for those individuals drinking at harmful or hazardous levels.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Shona Robison<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S3M-680</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Daily Express - Respect for the Elderly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the <em>Daily Express </em>for its Respect for the Elderly campaign; recognises that older people play a significant role in our society; welcomes the goal of the <em>Daily Express</em> to ensure that older people throughout the United Kingdom live with dignity and respect; notes that in Scotland, through policies such as free personal care, concessionary bus travel and the free central heating programme, measures have already been implemented to meet some of the needs of older people; condemns the increasing number of cases of elder abuse; recognises the importance of advocacy and the promotion of cultural change with regard to the rights of frail elderly people who, through physical or mental illness, are less able to speak for themselves; calls on the Care Commission to publish its findings more widely, including in local and national media, and acknowledges that more has to be done to confront ageism in our society.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-679</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Free Personal Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the interpretation, implementation and funding of the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 has been beset by difficulties, many of which remain unresolved; believes that the decision of Lord Macphail on the Petition of Argyll &amp; Bute Council dated 17 October 2007 is contrary to the intention of the Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Government to assure all people over 65 currently resident in independent care homes who have been assessed as eligible for free personal care, and others who may be assessed in future as so eligible, that councils will continue to fund their personal care regardless of whether or not there is a contract to which a council is a party.</p>
