<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5636</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>False Birthday Card Scam</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the methods used by the promoters of schemes to induce the public to apply for alleged free gifts, usually involving expensive phone calls, have reached a new low of sending individuals convincing-looking birthday cards with around eight to 10 apparently hand-written good wishes and signatures on one inside page and a promotion for the alleged free gifts, linked to repeated birthday wishes, on the other; urges promoters to give up such a deceitful way of securing more customers, and asks relevant regulatory bodies to press the promoters to give it up.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5635</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Donaldson&rsquo;s College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the presence of Donaldson&rsquo;s College in Holyrood on Thursday 22 February 2007; recognises the work of Donaldson&rsquo;s College in providing specialist education and support to children and young people who are either deaf or who have communication difficulties, and wishes the college well with its move to new bespoke premises in Linlithgow, allowing it to continue to provide such services to a wider catchment of students and to enhance its reputation as a leader in bilingual education.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5634</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to CRANES, Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the CRANES (Cancer Research Aberdeen and North East Scotland) charity on raising over &pound;100,000 towards a two-year study into the benefits of eating berries, dried fruit and fish to fight cancer; notes that the north east has the highest level of bowel cancer in the United Kingdom, and further notes that the study will allow the University of Aberdeen, in collaboration with researchers from the Rowett Research Institute, to carry out an in-depth study.</p>
<p>Supported by: Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Mr Ted Brocklebank<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Mike Rumbles<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5633</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Switching to Energy-Saving Light Bulbs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Australian government has announced plans to phase out the sale of incandescent light bulbs in favour of fluorescent energy-saving bulbs; further notes that it is estimated that this measure will reduce household lighting bills by 66% and reduce Australia&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by four million tonnes by 2015; notes the provision of free energy-efficient light bulbs for some low-income groups as part of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Warm Deal programme and the availability of reduced-cost energy-saving bulbs from many utility companies; encourages all those who use incandescent light bulbs to switch to fluorescent energy-saving bulbs as part of the fight against climate change, and calls on the Executive to consider further ways to accelerate the full uptake of energy-saving light bulbs in Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Margaret Smith<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jim Wallace<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Mr Andrew Arbuckle<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5632</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5631</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robert Brown<strong>*</strong></p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5598.1</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Road Tolling</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5598) in the name of Mr David Davidson, insert at end, &quot;believes further that full fiscal powers should be transferred to the Scottish Parliament in respect of taxation of motorists; notes that levels of taxation levied on motorists by successive Labour and Conservative governments have consistently been, or been among, the highest in Europe; considers that a variety of measures is needed to tackle levels of congestion, including more use of park and ride schemes as well as the use of flexible working and home working, and supports the further expansion of public transport in Scotland to provide people in Scotland with more alternatives to car use.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5598.2</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Road Tolling</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5598) in the name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s massive increase in funding for public transport since 1999; notes the growing problem of traffic congestion in Scotland and the impact this has on the economy and the impact of pollution on health and the environment; notes the lack of an alternative from the opposition parties to tackling congestion; notes that the Executive does not support penalising motorists, and believes that the potential benefits of all new measures to tackle congestion, such as road user charging, need to fully assessed, tested and evaluated in order to keep Scotland moving.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5598.3</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Road Tolling</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5598) in the name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that traffic congestion creates a huge burden for society in terms of delays, ill-health and social exclusion; notes that &quot;the CBI estimates that the costs to employers of transport congestion are around &pound;20 billion a year&quot;; recognises that any long-term strategy to reduce congestion and climate changing pollution will require the provision of quality public transport alternatives to car use together with a sensible and appropriate system of demand management; notes the failure of the Scottish Executive to provide leadership over the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s proposal for a congestion charging scheme and the Executive&rsquo;s plans for massive investment in new road capacity; notes that new road capacity has been shown to generate more traffic; notes that studies indicate that the introduction of nationwide road pricing is at least 10 years away; therefore calls on ministers to work with regional transport partnerships to consider the introduction of congestion charging and smart charge schemes at specific pinch points and congested areas of the road network, and believes that, in the immediate term, the Executive must reallocate funding for new road schemes to invest in public transport and cancel plans for new trunk roads that will generate increased traffic such as the M74 extension and the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route.&quot;</p>
