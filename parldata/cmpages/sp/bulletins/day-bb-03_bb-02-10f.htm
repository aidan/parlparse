Fife Community Safety Partnership on its introduction of an ice safety plan, a 
pro-active framework to help minimise the risk of people, particularly children, 
drowning by falling through ice on frozen lochs, inland waterways and areas of 
water deemed to be a danger to the public.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3876#</STRONG> <STRONG>Dr 
Sylvia Jackson: Funding for Local Roads</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
the Scottish Executive&#146;s £15 million funding award to local authorities to 
assist with the repair and improvement of the condition of local roads; recognises 
that for a number of decades the non-trunk roads network has suffered from under-investment, 
while the number of vehicles using such roads has increased dramatically; notes 
Stirling Council&#146;s recent cross-party scrutiny panel which called for a reduction 
in the number of ring-fenced budgets in order to address this problem; further 
notes the Scottish Road Maintenance Condition Survey by the Society of Chief Officers 
of Transportation in Scotland which will evaluate the non-trunk road network across 
Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use the report as a 
basis for allocating resources according to the needs identified, thereby providing 
a long-term funding programme for the non-trunk road network in Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3875</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Fitzpatrick: Kraszna-Krausz Book Award - Professor Larry J Schaaf</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates Professor Larry J Schaaf of the University of Glasgow, 
Research Professor in the Faculty of Arts and a historian and consultant engaged 
in researching, writing and lecturing, primarily on 19th century photography and 
its relationship to art and science, on the award on 4 February 2003, at the Arts 
Club in London, for the best book in the art, culture and history category of 
the Kraszna-Krausz Book Award for his work, <EM>The Photographic Art of William 
Henry Fox Talbot</EM>; notes that the international panel of judges described 
this work as, &quot;Larry Schaaf's finest achievement to date - a beautifully 
written, immensely learned and novel view of Talbot as the world's first photographic 
artist, taking us step by step through his development as a photographer"; recognises 
that this is the third time Professor Schaaf has won the main Kraszna-Krausz Book 
Award and develops on the recognition of his work in <EM>Records of the Dawn of 
Photography: Talbot's Notebooks P &amp; Q</EM> in 1996 and <EM>Out of the Shadows: 
Herschel, Talbot &amp; the Invention of Photography </EM>in 1992; commends the 
work of Professor Schaaf as the Director of the Correspondence of William Henry 
Fox Talbot Project at the university, and notes that the project is currently

<STRONG>Marilyn Livingstone: The Scottish Fire Service</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament recognises and values those who provide fire services in Scotland: 
supports a fair pay claim for firefighters and control staff and a new formula 
to achieve this; believes that a lasting resolution of the current fire dispute 
lies in meaningful negotiation; acknowledges the need for consultation on the 
future of the fire service; considers that such consultation should include reference 
to a number of sources, in particular the Scottish Executive publication <em>The 
Scottish Fire Service of the Future</em>; agrees with the Scottish Executive and 
the Fire Brigades Union that emphasis on community fire safety is necessary, and 
believes that a Fire Services bill should be introduced in the next Parliamentary 
session which would be subject to full and extensive consultation and scrutiny.

Peter Peacock</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3872</STRONG> <STRONG>John Farquhar Munro: Limited 
Partnership Tenancies</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament condemns the reported 
action by a number of landowners to terminate limited partnership tenancies ahead 
of the enactment of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill; believes such action 
would be a deliberate attempt to subvert the will of the Parliament, and calls 
on the Scottish Executive to take action to backdate to September 2002 the protection 
provided by the bill to tenants in limited partnerships.</P><P>Supported by: Stewart 
Stevenson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3871#</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: 
Glasgow City Council Against Pre-Emptive Attack on Iraq</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament applauds the anti-war initiative of Glasgow City Council in launching 
a petition opposed to war with Iraq; recognises the unanimous support of all five 
political parties represented on the council for this petition and the resolution 
passed by the council on 30 January 2003 which reads "The Council considers that 
a pre-emptive attack on Iraq is neither necessary nor justified and that it would 
produce incalculable risks to international peace and stability. The Council further 
considers that British participation in such an attack would be likely to have 
seriously damaging effects on Glasgow's social and economic welfare and to endanger 
the safety of its citizens. The Council accordingly calls upon Her Majesty's Government 
not to commit British Forces to a pre-emptive attack on Iraq."; notes that the 
petition allows the citizens of Glasgow to register their support or opposition 
to a war led by President Bush and the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and supports 
the council's resolution and opposes a pre-emptive attack on Iraq.<STRONG><em>

strong case for relocating public service jobs from Edinburgh to rural parts of 
Scotland; notes that the city of Inverness is being considered as one of four 
options for the location of the headquarters of Forest Enterprise; acknowledges 
that Inverness is already a regional office for the agency and has 44 staff who 
have responsibility for management of around two thirds of Scotland's forests, 
and considers that the Scottish Executive should support the case for the headquarters 
of Forest Enterprise to be relocated to Inverness.</P><P>Supported by: Stewart

to all stakeholders in the tourism sector. </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3868</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms 
Wendy Alexander: Paisley Threads</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
that running a home and being a parent is a hard job on the reduced income that 
young people usually receive; commends the support given by Barnardo&#146;s Paisley 
Threads to tenants and parents aged 16 to 21 living in Renfrewshire to take control 
of their lives through the pooling of information and advice on an individual 
and group basis in an unintimidating setting; acknowledges the role that Barnardo&#146;s 
plays in supporting 7,000 vulnerable children, young people and families in Scotland 
each year through 54 community-based services such as Paisley Threads, and realises 
that the short-term funding for such projects can hamper consistency of service 
for clients and their families.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3867</STRONG> <STRONG>Ross Finnie:

Closure of the Boots Factory in Airdrie</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament expresses 
its deep regret at the announcement of the closure of the Boots factory in Airdrie 
and the associated loss of almost 1000 jobs; recognises the valuable role that 
the workforce in Airdrie has played in building Boots as a company; urges all 
of the key agencies involved, along with Boots plc, to do everything in their 
power to reverse this decision, and, in the event of the closure going ahead, 
urges the Scottish Executive, Scottish Enterprise and Boots to ensure that the 
workforce is (a) given redundancy packages that recognises the excellent service 
that it and others have provided to the company over the last 54 years and (b)

for Forth Valley is the Royal Scottish National hospital site at Larbert; further 
notes that the board is to undertake further work including a feasibility study 
and transport impact assessment before submitting its outline business case to 
the Scottish Executive this summer; recognises that the Scottish Executive and 
the Minister for Health and Community Care retain the ultimate say over the location 
of the proposed new hospital for the area, and believes that the Executive should 
consider any case for a new hospital in the context of the accessibility of the 
hospital to the public and the consequential arrangements for community health 
care throughout the Forth Valley NHS Board area.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Keith 
Harding</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3863#</STRONG> <STRONG>Irene Oldfather: Dispersal of 
Civil Service Jobs</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the progress made 
to date on the dispersal of civil service jobs throughout Scotland; believes that 
an assessment should be made of the benefits that dispersal has brought to the 
respective local economies; notes the pending dissolution of the Parliament and 
seeks early expedition of the timetable for dispersal to ensure further progress; 
acknowledges that the selection criteria for such dispersals take account of cost, 
operational effectiveness, social, economic and environmental considerations and 
the position of staff; but nonetheless considers that priority should be given 
in future dispersals to areas such as Ayrshire, where there are above average 
levels of unemployment, to ensure that all of Scotland's communities share in 
the economic and social benefits of the policy of relocation.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3862</STRONG>

to the inauguration of this prize, which is in keeping with the second world war 
sentiments of Lady MacRobert expressed in the MacRobert motto &quot;Not For Self 
But For Country&quot; and celebrates the uniquely Scottish connection with the 
Royal Air Force of the name and legacy of MacRobert and the MacRobert&#146;s Reply, 
a legacy that should not be forgotten, which will now be proudly commemorated

Arbroath CAFE Project</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament applauds the pioneering

people in the area; notes that a safe, community alcohol-free environment was 
established where young people could socialise and engage in a wide range of activities, 
providing a positive alternative to &quot;life on the street&quot;; recognises 
the success of the project which has received national and international recognition 
and is being used as a model for projects elsewhere in the country and further 
afield; congratulates the project on being chosen as the launch pad in Scotland 
of the British Council&#146;s global Dreams and Teams project and on its plans 
to launch a pilot scheme, &quot;Street Football for All &quot; to take place throughout 
Angus with a view to becoming a national project, and wishes the CAFE Project

access to sport and promotion of sporting excellence among young people, are worthy

<STRONG>Trish Godman: The Madrid Declaration</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
commends the active involvement of Scottish members of the European Disability 
Forum in publishing the Madrid Declaration in this European Year of Disabled People; 
agrees with its authors that disability is a human rights issue, that people with 
disabilities seek equal opportunity, not charity, and that people in Scotland 
with disabilities are invisible citizens; supports their view that local authorities, 
employers, trade unions, educationalists and national authorities should be doing 
much more to ensure that people with disabilities enter the labour market as equals 
and that their employment should be based on equality in relation to terms, conditions 
and opportunities for promotion; endorses the Madrid Declaration, and calls on 
the Scottish Executive to pledge its support for the declaration.</P><P>Supported

Supplies</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the continued presence of lead 
pipes in both parts of the Scottish Water infrastructure and many domestic and 
business water supplies; notes the serious health hazards associated with lead 
in drinking water; notes the implications for the treatment of water supplies 
by Scottish Water and the unreliable nature of information as to the location 
of such lead pipes, and considers that an urgent review of the issue is needed 
and that action should be taken to ensure the removal of all lead pipes from drinking 
water supplies in Scotland as soon as possible and, specifically, to tackle the 
removal of lead pipes in Glasgow&#146;s older tenement areas.</P><P>Supported

the lack of sufficient funding for Scottish theatre; notes the cutbacks at Brunton 
Theatre; notes the contribution made over the years by groups such as the TAG 
Theatre Company, 7:84, Borderline, Theatre in Education and TWE Edinburgh; further 
notes the looming funding crisis for repertory theatre, especially the Royal Lyceum 
in Edinburgh; notes that unless funding equivalent to the funding available to 
theatre in England and Wales is made available, there will be a drift of talent 
southwards that will result in the ability of professional theatre to survive 
in Scotland being undermined in the near future.<STRONG><em> R</em></STRONG></P><P>Supported
