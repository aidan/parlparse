          <p><strong>*S2M-162</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Water 
            Industry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            dramatic increases in charges by Scottish Water to businesses in 2003-04 
            which, in some cases, amount to nearly 500% more than the amount charged 
            in 2002-03; believes that these increased charges bear no relation 
            to the service provided by Scottish Water to these customers; is concerned 
            that these rising costs have increased the competitive disadvantage 
            faced by Scottish firms, particularly in relation to England; further 
            notes that household bills have gone up by 94% in real terms over 
            the past decade, while English domestic bills have only risen by 22% 
            since 1989; acknowledges that privatisation in England has brought 
            substantial capital investment which has led to lower bills for businesses 
            and households alongside improved water quality; calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to address urgently the concerns of domestic and business 
            customers in relation to these higher charges and to look at widening 
            competition with a view to reducing costs, and further believes that, 
            as public ownership has failed customers in Scotland, the Executive 
            should investigate models of private ownership.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-161</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Care 
            Homes for the Elderly</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the threat of closure to the majority of the Church of Scotland&#146;s 
            care homes; further notes that this crisis has occurred against a 
            background of the Scottish Executive&#146;s assurance in the last 
            session of the Parliament that funding issues had been resolved; believes, 
            therefore, that this matter needs to be re-examined as a matter of 
            urgency with a view to achieving a sustainable funding agreement and 
            ending inequality in funding between local authority-run homes and 
            independent homes; recognises that there is a longer term issue to 
            be addressed by government, and calls on the Executive to consult 
            with Her Majesty&#146;s Government on how people might be encouraged 
            to make greater provision for their own long-term care.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-160</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Ground 
            Share Between Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian Football Clubs</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the ongoing discussions between Heart of Midlothian 
            Football Club and Hibernian Football Club on plans to ground share 
            with the possibility of moving to a new stadium at Straiton, Edinburgh; 
            is aware of the historical association of both clubs with their respective 
            grounds in the west and east of the city and the communities that 
            surround them, and calls on both clubs and the City of Edinburgh Council 
            to initiate a full consultation with both sets of fans about their 
            views on the proposals.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-159#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Zoos, 
            Conservation, Education and Research</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the closure of Glasgow Zoo, scheduled for September 
            2003, with the consequential requirement to re-house the animals and 
            the loss of a dedicated workforce; considers that the demise of Glasgow 
            Zoo raises issues about the role and funding of modern day zoos; further 
            notes that all zoos are now required to carry out a number of charitable 
            functions that require significant resourcing such as animal conservation, 
            education and scientific research, that zoos quite rightly also have 
            to maintain extremely high standards in animal welfare following strict 
            zoo licensing guidelines for the welfare and transaction of animals, 
            that they are regularly involved with organisations such as the Scottish 
            Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and HM Customs and 
            Excise in animal rescues and that they are labour intensive institutions 
            with high feeding, veterinary and infrastructure costs; is concerned 
            that, to fund the foregoing, a zoo in Scotland requires to be commercially 
            successful as it receives little or no central funding and that the 
            needs of animals and visitors are not always compatible, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should investigate central funding for 
            the conservation, research and education work carried out by zoos, 
            for example, at Edinburgh Zoo, where almost half of the animals are 
            in managed conservation and breeding programmes, some of which are 
            on the edge of extinction, such as the Amur tiger and the poison arrow 
            frog, where more than 25,000 schoolchildren per year are taught about 
            the interdependence of all living things and of our responsibility 
            for the biodiversity of the planet and where 40 under-graduate and 
            post-graduate students each year carry out non-invasive research on 
            all aspects of animal biology, nutrition and behaviour with direct 
            benefits to their kin, both in captivity and the wild.<strong><em>

            Ivol</strong>&#151;That the Parliament sends its support and solidarity 
            to Orkney woman Biz Ivol, who has highlighted the situation of people 
            with multiple sclerosis (MS) who need to seek medical supplies of 
            cannabis to help alleviate their suffering; is seriously concerned 
            about the health of all MS sufferers when the range of effective medical 
            help that they have at their disposal does not include medical cannabis 
            supplies; calls for greater financial resources to be allocated to 
            help search for treatments that alleviate the symptoms of MS; believes 
            that these treatments include the medical use of cannabis and further 
            calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government to issue an immediate review 
            of the law regarding the use of cannabis for medical purposes so that 
            MS suffers like Biz Ivol are not treated like criminals.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-156</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Student 
            Protests in Iran</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the student 
            uprising in Tehran; calls on the Scottish Executive to make representation 
            to the Home Office to impose a moratorium on the deportation of all 
            Iranian asylum seekers and refugees; acknowledges that these brave 
            students, currently protesting against privatisation measures at Tehran 
            University, could soon be seeking asylum in the United Kingdom if 
            they become subject to repression by the Iranian regime, and accords 
            them due respect and sympathy if they are forced to seek refuge in 
            the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-155</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Free 
            School Meals Policy in Wales</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            the National Assembly for Wales on introducing free school breakfasts 
            to all primary school children in Wales before the end of its second 
            term; commends the initiative of the Labour Party in Wales in bringing 
            this policy onto the legislative agenda and recommends that Labour 
            Party members of the Parliament look at the Welsh Labour official 
            press briefing which answered the question of why free school meals 
            should be provided by stating &quot;to help tackle poverty and because 
            the costs involved in setting up a bureaucratic system to collect 
            money, account for it, follow payments up if not made, etc. would 
            eat into the potential revenue as to make it not worth collecting. 
            By not confining the scheme to those entitled to free school meals 
            we avoid the problem of stigma with very young children.&quot;</p>

            in an attempt to increase patient focus and public involvement, will 
            only increase bureaucracy in an over-centralised NHS and considers 
            measures such as GP fundholding and foundation hospitals would offer 
            patients real choice regarding their own care, would focus on clinical 
            priorities over political priorities, and would, therefore, start

            presence across Scotland, introducing fully elected NHS boards, ensuring 
            public involvement in health services reorganisation by obliging NHS 
            boards to consult patients, staff and the public more effectively
