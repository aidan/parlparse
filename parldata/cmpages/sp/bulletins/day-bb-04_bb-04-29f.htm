          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1225</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Commemoration of Chernobyl Accident</strong>-That the Parliament notes that it is 18 years since the nuclear accident at Chernobyl occurred; further notes the terrible legacy in those countries most directly affected, namely Belarus, Ukraine and Russia; congratulates Scottish charities and civic organisations for their outstanding work in supporting individuals and communities affected, and recognises the need to take national and international action to avoid the possibility of future environmental catastrophes.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1224</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Imprisonment of Kurdish MPs in Turkey</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the decision taken on 21 April 2004 to confirm the 15-year prison sentence handed down to the Kurdish MPs Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Selim Sadak and Orhan Dogan by a state security court in Turkey for speaking Kurdish in the Turkish Parliament in 1994; notes that this verdict gives rise to serious concern in light of the European Union's political criteria and casts a negative shadow on the implementation of political reforms in Turkey; considers that this verdict is an insult to the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights which had ordered a retrial; further notes that Leyla Zana is a recipient of the European Parliament's Sakharov prize for freedom and that the four are considered &quot;prisoners of conscience&quot; by Amnesty International and have been referred to as political prisoners by the European Commission, and calls on the Turkish Government to release these prisoners immediately and halt the persecution of Kurdish representatives for trying to uphold their Kurdish identity.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1223#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Archaeology in Caithness</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the potential and significance of the archaeological resource in Caithness and believes that this resource, if properly exploited, will prove to be a tourism asset in the years to come.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1222</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Agenda for Change</strong>-That the Parliament notes the concerns expressed by, amongst others, UNISON's national health conference with regard to Agenda for Change; further notes that &quot;early implementers&quot; are reporting up to 30% of NHS staff facing inferior terms and conditions following application of the job evaluation system even before taking account of loss of unsocial hours payments; believes that NHS staff in general deserve greater recognition and pay; further believes that no NHS staff member should lose out as a result of Agenda for Change and that the Scottish Executive will have to make significant amendments to the current proposals if it is to avoid large sections of the NHS workforce rejecting Agenda for Change, and urges the Executive to take immediate action to avoid the prospect of a protracted dispute by making immediate moves to address all concerns raised.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1221</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Identity Cards</strong>-That the Parliament notes the Partnership Agreement commitment to evaluate the local pilot projects in order to assess the desirability of creating a national voluntary citizen's entitlement card for appropriate public services, taking care to protect individual privacy; welcomes previous commitments by the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government that identity cards will not be compulsory for accessing devolved services; supports measures that will genuinely help reduce the threat of terrorism and tackle crime and benefit fraud; believes that it is not proven that identity cards will achieve this, and calls on the Executive not to give Scottish police officers the legal right to demand proof of identity without cause.</P>
          <P>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong>, Jeremy Purvis<strong>*</strong>, Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong>, Mike Rumbles<strong>*</strong>, John Farquhar Munro<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Iain Smith<strong>*</strong>, Dr Jean Turner<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1219.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Reducing Reoffending - Improving the Effectiveness of Custodial and Non-Custodial Sentences</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1219) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end &quot;but is, as yet, not persuaded of the case for a single national correctional agency.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1218.1</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>European Constitution</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1218) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that the only way to ensure a sustainable future for the Scottish fishing industry is to restore national and local control of Scottish waters by negotiating withdrawal from the Common Fisheries Policy and calls on Her Majesty's Government to hold the referendum on the EU Constitution following final agreement of its terms to give our people the opportunity to reject this centralising constitution and help to shape a new, flexible Europe of nation states working in partnership.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1218.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>European Constitution</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1218) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;negotiate&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognise that the European Constitution makes fundamental changes to the structures of the European Union that will further erode local and national democracy, strengthen the grip of the largest and wealthiest nation states of Europe at the expense of the smaller nations and stateless nations, undermine public services in Scotland by opening the door to wholesale privatisation, jeopardise the existence of our fishing industry by engraving in stone the disastrous Common Fisheries Policy, transfer powers over energy to the EU which in turn can be used to block any future moves to bring our oil, gas, and electricity industries into public ownership, lead to a further militarisation of the European continent and give carte blanche to large multi-national states such as Spain and the United Kingdom to deny minority nations within these states the right to genuine self-determination, and, in the light of the damage that this constitution will do to Scotland's present and future interests and given that opposition to the proposed constitution is even stronger in Scotland than the rest of the UK, calls on Her Majesty's Government to call a separate referendum for Scotland.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1218.3</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>European Constitution</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1218) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that management of fisheries, as a shared resource in the seas around Europe, transcends national boundaries; condemns the long history of Common Fisheries Policy management driven by political rather than scientific considerations; recognises that such political management has led to the current plight of fish stocks and fishing communities; agrees that the newly-reformed Common Fisheries Policy offers a brighter future given the proposals for conservation of stocks based on scientific analysis combined with fishermen's expertise to agree sustainable managements on a regional basis, and calls on the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government not to abandon the goal of sustainable management of fisheries and to engage actively in negotiations to ensure that the final draft of the Constitution is not detrimental to Scottish interests on fisheries, renewable energy and other matters.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1218.4</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>European Constitution</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1218) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;negotiate&quot; to end and insert &quot;agree a Treaty that, in the context of an enlarging Union, is clearer and simpler than the existing treaties, to bring the European Union closer to the citizens of Europe; notes that the current draft Treaty simply makes explicit the European Community's exclusive competence over marine conservation as set out in the United Kingdom's Treaty of Accession, as part of the Common Fisheries Policy, which both Her Majesty's Government and the Scottish Executive are committed to reform to deliver effective regional management of, and a sustainable future for, Scotland's fishing industry; notes that the text makes reference for the first time to the role of sub-national parliaments and offers enhanced scope for collaboration to tackle international crime and the threat of terrorism, and welcomes the benefits to Scotland of EU membership, including economic prosperity, trade, environmental and consumer protection and citizens' and workers' rights.&quot;</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-1204*#*</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Newton Dee Village Community</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the huge investment in, and the excellent and unique work accomplished at, the Newton Dee Village Community since 1940 and also at the 11 other centres of the Camphill Village Trust through the provision of fulfilling work opportunities and homes for adults with learning disabilities; commends the pioneering health care provision available to residents and the local community; recognises the impact this has on the development of wide-ranging interests and participation in cultural and social activities, and believes that everything possible should be done to allow the community to continue undisturbed and to develop over future years.</P>
