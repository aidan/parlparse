<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4124</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Tourette Syndrome</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work carried out by Tourette Scotland, Scotland&rsquo;s national organisation that provides advice and support for children and adults with Tourette Syndrome (TS) and for everyone involved in their lives; congratulates Tourette Scotland for organising a series of &quot;Activity Days&quot; for people with TS and their families so they can learn more about the disorder in a friendly and understanding environment; believes that the majority of people throughout Scotland do not fully understand TS, including the general public, health professionals and teachers; notes that many children who suffer from TS or associated disorders are not diagnosed at an early stage and that this can lead to the child being victimised and excluded from school as their disorder is mistaken for misbehaving; further notes that services for diagnosis and treatment for people with TS vary significantly across Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Executive should do more to ensure that people with TS get the appropriate level of care required and that health professionals and teachers are given the correct training to recognise TS and associated disorders.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4123</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Excessive Paperwork</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that many aspects of Scottish life suffer from an excess of regulation and paperwork, which is created and imposed by the European Union, Whitehall, the Scottish Executive, councils and health and other authorities, and suggests that, to help reduce this burden and to free the energies and initiative of those burdened, relevant Parliamentary committees should each set up a reduction of bureaucracy sub-group which would work with the initiators of, and sufferers from, excessive regulation and paperwork with the aim of significantly reducing its volume.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4122</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Artists&rsquo; Rates of Pay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that public bodies, such as the Scottish Executive, councils and health, enterprise and education authorities, should pay agreed professional rates to artists working in any of the arts in projects funded by public bodies.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4121</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Support the Strike for Pension Rights on 28 March 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the overwhelming mandate from local government workers to strike in defence of their contractual pension rights on 28 March 2006; regrets that the actions of the Westminster Government and the Scottish Executive in pressing for the abolition of the Rule of 85 have directly caused this trade union revolt; believes that there is no justification for this erosion of the pension rights of local government workers, most of whom are low-paid and women who already suffer pay discrimination; wholeheartedly supports the trade unions in their campaign, and calls on the Executive to stick up for workers in their jurisdiction by declaring their support for the retention of the Rule of 85 and, by so doing, to exert pressure on the Westminster Government to draw back from the biggest confrontation with workers since 1926.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4120</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Outreach Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff of its Outreach Services on their work in the provision of the &quot;MSPs in Schools&quot; programme by facilitating sessions in schools to enable children and young people to gain a greater understanding of the work of the Parliament and participate directly in bringing real issues, through a variety of innovative methods, to the attention of their MSPs; believes that this programme has enabled children and young people to become directly involved with the political process and encourages political awareness in voters of the future, and congratulates the Outreach Services team for providing a valuable service in active citizenship complementary to the sessions offered to schools within the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4119</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Lothian Buses Fares Increases</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep disappointment at the decision by Lothian Buses to increase its fares by up to 25%; believes that the increases will act as a further disincentive to people to use public transport in the region at a time when the city faces significant congestion problems and car exhaust emissions; notes that the company blames the rise on the fuel prices over the past year, yet in recent months these costs have in fact been falling; calls on Lothian Buses to reconsider its decision and recognise that the costs of short bus journeys in the city of Edinburgh are now among the most expensive in Scotland, and believes that Lothian Buses&rsquo; decision is both economically short-sighted and detrimental to strategies for encouraging greater public transport and countering environmental pollution.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4118</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Unbearable Cruelty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports PETA&rsquo;s campaign to stop the Ministry of Defence from using bear pelts to make headpieces for the five Guards&rsquo; regiments and start having the hats fashioned from faux fur instead; considers that the use of real bear fur causes unneccessary cruelty to bears; notes that one bear in seven is not killed immediately when shot, that some escape wounded, possibly dying later from blood loss or starvation, and that others are ensnared for days in cruel traps; considers the slaughter of animals for their fur to be totally unneccessary and shameful, and urges the UK Government to set a compassionate example and switch to a humane and progressive alternative material for soldiers&rsquo; headwear.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4117</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Mehmet Tarhan is Free</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends solidarity greetings to Mehmet Tarhan, the gay Kurdish conscientious objector who was released from military prison in Turkey on 9 March 2006; notes that the &quot;crime&quot; for which he has been imprisoned since 9 April 2005 was refusing to kill, as he is a conscientious objector and refused to be drafted into the Turkish army; is appalled that he suffered torture and solitary confinement while in prison and twice went on hunger strike to win equal treatment with other prisoners; considers that his release is a victory for his determination to refuse the army&rsquo;s offer of avoiding the draft by allowing himself to be classified as &quot;ill&quot; because he is gay; considers it abhorrent that the Turkish army and police, and even teachers, are allowed to perform &quot;virginity tests&quot;, involving forced anal and vaginal penetration of men and women, which are a pretext to perpetrate rape and other sexual violence and notes that Mehmet Tarhan refused to submit to this abuse; further notes that the court which freed Mehmet has ruled that such &quot;tests&quot; are a violation of human rights and considers that this precedent will help in women&rsquo;s struggle against this form of legalised abuse in Turkey; is concerned that, despite his release from prison, the army could still try to force Mehmet to serve against his will; congratulates the Payday and Wages Due Lesbians organisations for their work in highlighting Mehmet&rsquo;s case, campaigning for his release and for exposing the persecution of conscientious objectors in Turkey, and demands that Turkey be forced to adhere to the European Court of Human Rights&rsquo; guidance and other international rulings recognising the right to conscientious objection and to abolish from its military regulations the definition of homosexuality as an illness.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4116</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Standard Life Demutualisation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recently prepared economic impact assessment of Standard Life; recognises the financial, social and employment record of this mutually owned company, particularly in Edinburgh and Scotland; acknowledges that Standard Life is the last large mutual insurance company preparing to demutualise during the summer of 2006 and that, in spite of well-intentioned aims, there can be no absolute guarantees as to its ownership, headquarters, operation and employment policies; notes that the company directors have announced that, in the event of a successful demutualisation exercise, it is intended that unclaimed shares be placed in a charitable foundation, as has been the case in all demutualisations in the United Kingdom; whilst approving of this proposal, calls on the company to enhance the aim of creating a long-lasting charitable foundation by ensuring that present-day members can contribute some, or all, of their allocation of shares, and encourages generosity by members, with the directors giving a lead with their own allocation, indicating that the charitable foundation will be the future recipient of &quot;orphan assets&quot; at the appropriate time, be they unclaimed shares, policies or dividends, thus ensuring that a part of inter-generational equity created over the last 180 years in this successful company is available in the years to come to benefit the greater community of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4101*#*</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Post Office Card Accounts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent announcement that Post Office Card Accounts are to be phased out by 2010; notes that this news has come as a&nbsp;shock to pension and benefits claimants in north-east Scotland, many of whom rely on the service especially where there are no local bank branches, as well as to Post Office staff&nbsp;who&nbsp;view the scheme as a vital service; believes that the phasing out of this service could put the future of some rural post offices in severe jeopardy and lead to many of these lifeline services being lost to communities already being stripped of other vital services; supports the National Federation of SubPostmasters&rsquo; campaign to have Post Office Card Accounts retained, and considers that the Scottish Government should make appropriate representations to the UK Government on behalf of Post Office Card Account users in Scotland.</p>
