<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2155</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Kilbirnie Ladeside FC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kilbirnie Ladeside Football Club on its historic Whyte and Mackay West of Scotland Cup Final 5&ndash;1 triumph over Stagecoach Super League Premier Division champions, Pollok; recognises the importance of junior football in engaging young men in healthy and constructive activity; understands that local football teams play a vital role in maintaining local identity and community cohesion, and wishes Kilbirnie Ladeside manager, Tommy Bryce, success in his quest to build on this triumph as the team compete for promotion next season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2154</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Torphichen Centenary Gala Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Torphichen Village will celebrate its Centenary Gala Day on Saturday 14 June 2008; also notes that current and past residents of Torphichen will gather in the village to mark this centenary year, including Mary McGlinchey, the Torphichen Gala Day Queen of 1935, and her &quot;Champion&quot; of 1935, Mr Jackie Prentice, who will be travelling from Houston, Texas, to join in the Centenary Gala Day; congratulates the Centenary Gala Day Queen, Caroline Perry, and wishes Caroline, the Torphichen Gala Day organising committee and all past and current residents of Torphichen Village a very happy and successful 100th Gala Day.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2153</strong> <strong>James Kelly:</strong> <strong>Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of a recent survey carried out by the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society, in which it was highlighted that 32% of people with Parkinson&rsquo;s are not being diagnosed by specialists, that more than 3 in 10 disease sufferers have never seen a Parkinson&rsquo;s disease nurse specialist, that more than one-third of sufferers have never been referred to a physiotherapist, that more than half have never been referred to an occupational or speech and language therapist; welcomes the views of many respondents that a Parkinson&rsquo;s disease nurse specialist was found to provide a useful source of information about their condition; notes that some NHS boards continue to provide no access to nurse specialists and that the provision of specialist nurses in other areas is heavily oversubscribed, and calls on the Scottish Executive and NHS boards to examine this report in detail to ensure that Parkinson&rsquo;s disease sufferers are able to access the appropriate range of support services in every area of Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2152</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>HMRC Office Restructuring Proposals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs that it will review its operations, with proposals to withdraw from 19 local offices that it currently operates across Scotland, threatening 700 jobs as a result; believes that this is another example of the centralising tendencies of the UK Government, and further believes that any loss of jobs from the UK Civil Service gives the lie to the notion that Scotland somehow benefits from a Union &quot;dividend&quot; as part of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2151</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Graham&rsquo;s - The Family Dairy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the successes of Graham&rsquo;s Dairy in Bridge of Allan, which now enjoys the rare accolade of a second award at the Scottish Food and Drink Excellence Awards; notes the recent open day held by the dairy that was attended by both local MSPs and councillors and which proved to be an extremely successful event; welcomes the social and environmental benefits brought by the provision of high-quality, healthy and locally-produced food, and expresses its support for home-grown family-run businesses like Graham&rsquo;s which contribute so much to Scotland&rsquo;s employment and economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2150</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Nature and Sustainable Growth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Nature and Sustainable Growth</em> by RSPB Scotland; welcomes the identification of the benefits of environmental restoration as an integral part of social and economic regeneration and the wider benefits to public health, nature conservation and biodiversity; notes that the potential locations cited such as the East Ayrshire Coalfield, the Clyde Valley, our firths and estuaries, and in particular the Firth of Forth, and, in light of the challenges of climate change, urges the Scottish Executive to examine the exciting proposals contained in <em>Nature</em> <em>and Sustainable Growth</em> as practical initiatives to be considered in the review of the National Planning Framework.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2149</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Protecting Asylum-Seeker Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the comments of Children&rsquo;s Commissioner Kathleen Marshall when she said &quot;In Scotland we&rsquo;re getting some things right &hellip; The Scottish Government has spoken out against unacceptable methods of forced removal of children and set a lead in allowing asylum seekers access to further or higher education&quot;; acknowledges her warning that much remains to be done; commits itself to continuing to work to protect the rights of asylum-seeker children, and calls on the Scottish Government to do likewise.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2148</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Upgrading of the A92</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign to dual the A92 from Glenrothes to the Melville Lodge roundabout in north east Fife and as a priority to upgrade the Parbroath junction, which is the only major intersection between Kirkcaldy and Dundee without a roundabout; commends the efforts of local people campaigning to upgrade the section between Preston roundabout and Balfarg junction, and notes that in terms of accidents the A92 is one of the most dangerous roads in Scotland with over 600 accidents in the last five years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2147</strong> <strong>Christopher Harvie:</strong> <strong>First Female Chief Constable in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Kingdom of Fife and Fife Constabulary on the appointment of the first female Chief Constable in Scotland; further congratulates Chief Constable Norma Graham, and expresses its hopes that this will mark a step towards the fair and equal representation of women in the higher positions of the public service in Scotland and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2146</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>No News is Bad News for the BBC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the BBC Trust report which highlights the absence of coverage in UK news bulletins of items that are of concern to Scotland; further notes that bulletins labelled as national are in fact almost exclusively English, and calls on the BBC to act swiftly to bring about an equity of programming to reflect the true nature of issues that are pertinent both to constituent nations of the United Kingdom and to the UK as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2145</strong> <strong>Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Ardgowan Hospice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ardgowan Hospice volunteers on receiving the prestigious Queen&rsquo;s Award for Voluntary Service; extends grateful thanks to all those volunteers who give freely of their time to raise funds, provide transport, staff the hospice shop, and carry out reception and kitchen duties, and recognises that without such commitment there would be no hospice movement.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2144</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Approaches to Alcohol and Drugs in Scotland: A Question of Architecture</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees with the recent report of Scotland&rsquo;s Futures Forum that social and attitudinal change as is being sought with alcohol and tobacco also has a role to play in the problem of drug use; believes that implementing the recommendation of an improved method of informing the public, especially young people, of the dangers of substance abuse would increase the ability of people in that age group to make better choices; further agrees that the drinks industry has a part to play in reducing alcohol abuse and in changing public attitudes to drinking by seeking to end irresponsible drinks promotions; commends Diageo, which has a significant presence in Clackmannanshire, for the great deal of work it has already done in that field; supports the rigorous enforcement of legislation by local licensing boards that will encourage improvements in drinking culture, paving the way for a transformation in attitudes to all form of substance abuse, and, despite not supporting all its recommendations, welcomes the report as at the very least a valid contribution to the debate on substance misuse in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2143#</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Proposed Changes to Maternity Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is currently undertaking a consultation on proposed changes to maternity services in Clyde; notes that the consultation is proposing to remove birthing services from the Community Maternity Units (CMUs) at the Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Greenock and the Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria and centralise them both at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; highlights that the CMUs have been in operation since 2003; further highlights that the Independent Scrutiny Panel initiated by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing recommended that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde maintain the CMUs for a further three years alongside a community education programme but this has been rejected by the board; further notes that in its consultation document the board states that it does &quot;...not think there is anything to do to significantly improve this&quot; in terms of promoting the usage of the CMU service, and invites the board to listen to the people of the Clyde area who wish the CMUs to remain open, an outcome which would also have the benefit of reducing the stress and strain on the staff at the Royal Alexandra Hospital.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2142</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Train Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the withdrawal of all catering from services north of Edinburgh by Cross Country Trains, which means that passengers using these trains can get nothing to eat or drink; points out that passengers travelling north of Edinburgh and south of Plymouth into Cornwall are being discriminated against by this policy; urges the company to think again about the withdrawal of catering for passengers on these routes, and asks ministers to investigate whether this move represents a breach of the franchise agreement.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2141</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>&quot;Campus Cops&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the excellent work being carried out in schools throughout Scotland by &quot;campus cops&quot;; supports the view of Detective Chief Superintendent John Carnochan, Head of Strathclyde Police&rsquo;s Violence Reduction Unit, that the role carried out by such officers is unique in its success in building stronger community relationships; is delighted that &quot;campus cops&quot; act as positive role models for some young people who may lack such figures in their lives; congratulates the work done by &quot;campus cops&quot; which, in some cases has resulted in as much as a 14% reduction in street crime such as vandalism, a reduction in pupil absence, truancy, staff absence, the number of young people getting into trouble with the police outside school hours and a reduction in bullying and an increase in attainment where they have been deployed; notes that &quot;campus cops&quot; interact with primary schools to carry out road traffic, anti-litter, anti-graffiti and stranger-danger work; understands that, where they have been deployed, &quot;campus cops&quot; can gather intelligence; and become an integral part of the school community in a way that is valued and respected by both staff and pupils, often assisting pupils with difficult home lives, and looks forward to the national evaluation which will undoubtedly echo preliminary evaluations and vindicate the vital role that &quot;campus cops&quot; play in Scottish schools in the 21st century.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2140</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Ullapool Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concerns being expressed by the Ullapool Primary School Parents Council over the adverse effects which the ongoing budget cuts being made by the Highland Council are having upon the educational quality at Ullapool Primary School; notes that due to lack of finances the school has no library service and, because of the budget cuts this year, no swimming classes and no specialist teachers for music or higher education, and therefore calls on the council to make the necessary resources available to ensure that children attending Ullapool Primary School receive the resources needed to provide for their education.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2137*#*</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Living and Dying with Advanced Heart Failure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Living and dying with advanced heart failure: a palliative care approach</em>, by the Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care with the support of British Heart Foundation Scotland and the Scottish Government; notes that people with heart failure have a worse prognosis and poorer quality of life than many cancer patients and that 50% of advanced heart failure patients die within a year of diagnosis, many of them suddenly and unexpectedly, *particularly in the west of Scotland*; believes that uncertainty around prognosis should not be a barrier to people with advanced heart failure, or those with any other condition, receiving appropriate palliative care; is concerned that, despite the recommendations of the CHD and Stroke Task Force in 2001 that provision needed to be made for palliative care for advanced heart failure, too many of these vulnerable patients are still not getting the care they need at the time that they need it most, *and believes that account should be taken of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and that the needs of patients with conditions other than cancer, like advanced heart failure, should be explicitly addressed in the forthcoming palliative care strategy and the refreshed CHD and Stroke Strategy*.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2128</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Banknotes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by HM Treasury to back down over its proposals for Scottish banks to lodge funds with the Bank of England to cover the value of their notes on seven days a week, which threatened the very existence of Scottish banknotes; congratulates HM Treasury for its common-sense, whilst belated, decision; congratulates all those voices in Scotland and further afield for lending support to the campaign for the right of Scots to have Scottish banknotes in their pockets, and calls on HM Treasury to do the right thing by taking the same considered approach and abandoning any plans to issue new coins of the realm with heraldic emblems and paraphernalia which are specific to England and therefore exclude the other nations of the United Kingdom, namely Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2128.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Scottish Banknotes</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2128) in the name of Gil Paterson, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;bemoans the apparent SNP hypocrisy on this issue, given that SNP policy is to replace the pound with the Euro, which move would permanently eliminate Scottish banknotes as Euro notes can only be issued by the European Central Bank.&quot;</p>
