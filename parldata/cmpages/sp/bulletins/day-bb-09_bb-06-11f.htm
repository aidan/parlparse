<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4358</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Remploy&rsquo;s Contract with Thistle Systems Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Remploy, Scotland&rsquo;s leading provider of employment opportunities for disabled people, on the recent signing of an exclusive UK-wide distribution deal with Thistle Systems Group, based in Cumbernauld, for the distribution of the eMotion Wall; considers that the eMotion Wall is a highly innovative electronic storage device that can be moved merely by pressing a button to increase or decrease classroom sizes, and believes that this is an impressive product and achievement that will continue to be a success and will benefit the community and boost employment prospects for many disabled people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4357</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Good Luck to Edinburgh Global Partnerships Students</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes all of the students of Edinburgh Global Partnerships (EGP) well with their volunteering projects over the summer; notes that the aim of EGP is not to conduct large-scale aid projects but rather to get involved with local people in communities in the developing world, helping them financially and physically to realise projects that they believe are of most importance to their communities; notes that projects will take place in Malawi, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, India and Mongolia, and hopes that all of the volunteers enjoy taking part in the projects that will not only be beneficial to them but to the many people whom they are helping.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4356</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Bicentenary of Galston Parish Church</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Galston Parish Church, erected in 1808 and opened in 1809, will be celebrating its bicentenary on Thursday 18 June 2009; recognises that worship has taken place on this site for over 750 years, with the original church, which was dedicated to St Peter and granted to the Red Friars in 1252; acknowledges the church&rsquo;s place in Scotland&rsquo;s history with its ministers including Dr George Smith, great-grandfather of Robert Louis Stevenson and who was mentioned by Robert Burns in his poem, <em>The Holy Fair</em>, and Robert Stirling, 19th century inventor of the Stirling Engine, which re-emerged in use as an alternative to the steam engine, and its covenanting links commemorated in the grave of Andrew Richmond, who was shot by Graham of Claverhouse in 1679, and by a Covenanters&rsquo; memorial; further recognises that the present church, occupying a prominent site over the village, was designed by John Brash of Glasgow to a plan described as most simple, convenient and elegant, was renovated in 1879 and 1999, had a chancel added in 1912 and contains stained glass windows by Oscar Paterson, a contemporary of Charles Rennie Mackintosh; notes also that the Right Reverend Bill Hewitt, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, who was born and raised in nearby Kilmarnock, will preach at the bicentenary event, and wishes the parish minister, the Reverend Graeme Wilson, and his parishioners all the best for this important event and for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4355</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Amateur Football Hat Trick for Kilmarnock and Loudoun</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Knockentiber Amateur Football Cub (AFC) on winning the Lindsay Fencing Ayrshire Premier League for a record sixth time and for winning the British Energy Ayrshire Amateur Challenge Cup and recognises that it is the most successful amateur football club in Ayrshire; further congratulates Hurlford Thistle AFC on reaching the finals of the British Energy Ayrshire Amateur Challenge Cup and the Foster&rsquo;s Centenary Scottish Amateur Cup, and also congratulates Galston United AFC on achieving third spot in the Lindsay Fencing Ayrshire Premier League, making it a hat trick of team successes for amateur football in Kilmarnock and Loudoun.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4047.1 Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Dispensing GP Practices in Rural Communities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4047) in the name of John Lamont, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the integral role that dispensing plays in the structure and function of many dispensing practices; notes the stated intention of the Scottish Government to review the provision of the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations (1995) in respect of public consultation, and more generally calls for the whole process to be reviewed to include requirements to (a) notify any dispensing practice that may be affected, (b) ensure that the patients served by such practices and the communities are fully consulted, (c) include an independent evaluation on the effects upon the stability and service provisions by that practice, (d) ensure that any determination by the appropriate committee on any application should take into account the effects upon practices affected and (e) ensure that the practice itself, not just the area medical committee, is able to make representations to the board committee determining applications for pharmacy services.&quot;</p>
