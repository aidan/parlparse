            <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Sea Eagle Project</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Sea Eagle Project Team for its work in encouraging the reintroduction 
            of sea eagles to Scotland; notes the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 
            birds' reintroduction to the country and recognises the progress made 
            in re-establishing them in their natural habitat; acknowledges that 
            while the project has reached the significant milestone of the hundredth 
            fledging, there are still less than 20 breeding pairs of sea eagles 
            in Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to support the 
            efforts to increase the numbers of sea eagles in Scotland.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1420#</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: 
            Scottish Berry Project</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the rate 
            of coronary heart disease in Scotland is now the highest in western 
            Europe, that Scotland has a long-established soft fruit industry that 
            is suffering economic distress, that advances in medicine have conclusively 
            demonstrated a link between increased consumption of fruit and vegetables 
            and a reduction in risk from coronary heart disease, but that Scottish 
            consumption falls far below even the World Health Organisation recommended 
            minimum of 400g per day; further notes that a holistic approach to 
            these factors which crosses traditional government departmental structures 
            has enabled Finland in the last 25 years to reduce its rate of coronary 
            heart disease by 50% and that a plan for such a cross-sectoral approach 
            has been put forward as a &quot;Berry Scotland Project&quot;, and 
            recommends that the Scottish Executive takes forwards a cross-sectoral 
            project that reflects the aims of the original &quot;Berry Scotland 
            Project&quot; in order to raise consumption of soft fruit, especially 
            the home produced product, which the Finnish experience has demonstrated 
            could significantly benefit both the rural economy and public health.</font></p>

            Human Cloning</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the need for a far-reaching 
            and thorough debate concerning human cloning; notes that the European 
            Parliament has voted for a ban on human cloning; further notes that 
            there are ethical alternatives to the use of stem cells from human 
            embryos, and believes that Her Majesty's Government should withdraw 
            any regulations which might implement the proposals of the Donaldson 
            Report until the matter has been more fully debated.</font></p>

            Scottish Women Against Pornography</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            evidence exists to suggest that the propagation of pornography within 
            our society helps to create unacceptable attitudes, behaviour and 
            aggression towards women; believes that the vast and powerful pornography 
            industry exploits women and their sexual and economic inequality for 
            profit, and welcomes the launch of Scottish Women Against Pornography's 
            recent postcard campaign designed to expose the severity with which 
            women feel that their status within society is undermined by the pornography 
            industry.</font></p>

            the continuing recognition by the European Union of 3 December as 
            European Day of Disabled Persons; notes that this day provides an 
            opportunity to raise public awareness about issues which impact on 
            disabled people and calls upon the Scottish Executive to work with 
            disability organisations, public agencies, the private sector and, 
            most importantly, disabled people themselves to ensure that the provisions 
            of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 are implemented in all spheres 
            of life, enabling disabled people to access goods and services no 
            matter where they live in Scotland.</font></p>
