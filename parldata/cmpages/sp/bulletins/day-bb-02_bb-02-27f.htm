          <p> <strong>*S1M-2789</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Protection of Scottish 
            Coral Reefs</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            recent research from the Marine Biological Station on Cumbrae, published 
            by the Royal Society, which shows that large and diverse coral reefs 
            off the north-west of Scotland which are more than 4,500 years old 
            and the habitat of diverse and unique marine species are suffering 
            wide-scale fishing damage and requests that the Scottish Executive 
            and Her Majesty&#146;s Government take urgent action to protect the 
            &quot;Darwin Mounds&quot; and other environmentally significant areas 
            of deep-sea coral, including designating them as marine Special Areas 
            of Conservation.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2788#</strong> <strong>Angus MacKay: The Tourism Industry</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises that the economy of Edinburgh and the whole 
            of Scotland depends greatly on not only attracting tourists but also 
            encouraging them to return; further recognises the importance of tourist 
            accommodation and attractions being of the highest possible quality, 
            and considers that<font color="#0000ff"> </font>the Scottish Executive 
            should encourage and support the maintenance of high standards in 
            the tourism industry to ensure that visitors to Scotland have a memorable 
            experience and return.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2787</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Stop Indecent

            that the public sale and display of pornographic material in our local 
            stores, newsagents and garages is completely unacceptable; further 
            recognises that pornography eroticises violence against women and 
            children and desensitises the public to the meaning of violence towards 
            women in real life, and calls on the Executive to ensure that the 
            Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 is fully and effectively enforced 
            and to review this legislation to ensure that it is adequate.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2786#</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie: Renfrewshire

            a.m. </em>on 25 February 2002; congratulates all agencies involved 
            in creating this economic success, and commends the Renfrewshire model 
            to the rest of Scotland as an example of good practice.</p>

            on 22 December 1992, which declared 22 March of each year as World 
            Day for Water; further notes that this year the highly pertinent theme 
            is &quot;Water and Health&quot;; expresses concern that many of our 
            children do not have access to free drinking water whilst at school; 
            commends North Lanarkshire Council and the South Coatbridge Social 
            Inclusion Partnership for initiating pilot schemes in four Coatbridge 
            primary schools to supply free, accessible drinking water to pupils, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should recognise and promote 
            the importance for our children&#146;s health and well-being of providing 
            free, accessible drinking water in all schools.</p>

            Women Together group in the Pollok constituency and women across Scotland 
            and around the world who are organising events to celebrate the work 
            of women past, present and future; recognises the central role of 
            women in our communities in meeting needs today and creating change 
            for tomorrow and beyond, and urges the Scottish Executive and the 
            Parliament's committees, in partnership with women's organisations, 
            to examine how women's needs and rights might more effectively be 
            addressed across the range of services, departments and organisations 
            that impact on women's lives. </p>

            the Parliament welcomes the work of the Cross-Party Group on Survivors

            national strategy for children and adults who have experienced sexual 
            abuse during childhood and, in light of recommendations made by the 
            independent inquiry commissioned by Fife Council following the conviction 
            of David Logan Murphy, believes that the Scottish Executive should 
            actively develop a national strategy, based on the work of the Cross-Party 
            Group on Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse, that considers the wider 
            social, health, mental and legal implications of sexual abuse and
