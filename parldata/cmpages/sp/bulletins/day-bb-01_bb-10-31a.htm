                            far to enable integration; welcomes the appointment 
                            of a Scottish Minister with responsibilities in this 
                            area; notes that the statement by the Home Secretary 
                            in the Westminster Parliament on 29 October 2001 indicates 
                            a move by Her Majesty's Government contrary to the 
                            current direction of the Scottish Executive, particularly 
                            in the establishment of &quot;accommodation centres&quot; 
                            as opposed to sensitive dispersal and the imposition 
                            of &quot;Smart Cards&quot; as a form of electronic 
                            voucher for asylum seekers, and calls for the Scottish 
                            Parliament and the Scottish Executive to welcome asylum 
                            seekers and refugees into our communities and to have 
                            the power to provide appropriate services to promote 
                            true integration.&quot; </font></p>

                            refuge for the genuinely oppressed is severely hampered 
                            by the problems associated with our asylum system,

                            towards the policy of the Conservative Party, which 
                            will speed up the process of establishing which claims 
                            are well-founded and subsequently enable every possible

                            of citizenship as enjoyed by the rest of the community.&quot;
