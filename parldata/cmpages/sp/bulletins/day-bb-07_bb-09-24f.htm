          <p><strong>*S3M-530</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>The Cost to Scotland of Children&rsquo;s Poor Communication</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent report by I CAN, the children&rsquo;s communication charity, entitled <em>The Cost to the Nation of Children&rsquo;s Poor Communication in Scotland</em>; acknowledges the importance of the conclusions of the report which illustrate the potential long-term economic cost to Scotland of not identifying and remedying children&rsquo;s communication difficulties at an early age; acknowledges the strong links between communication impairments, social deprivation and an increased likelihood of being not in education, employment or training (NEET) and that Scotland already has the highest proportion of young people who are NEET of all OECD countries; notes that a central role for communication which is embedded in the curriculum, skilled and confident parents and carers and a focused early intervention policy can have an enormous positive impact on children&rsquo;s language development; urges all MSPs to support I CAN and consider the findings of the report, and hopes that the Scottish Government will ensure that communication skills, speech and language therapy feature strongly in its recently announced comprehensive strategy on early years.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-529</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong> <strong>Beautiful Scotland Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement of the 2007 Beautiful Scotland awards, run by Keep Scotland Beautiful; welcomes the recognition which the awards provide to communities that work to enhance their local areas; applauds all the entrants for their efforts to promote litter-free environments, encourage recycling and increase tourism, and congratulates North Berwick on winning the prestigious Rosebowl Trophy, the Best Coastal Resort Award and the VisitScotland Award for Tourism.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-528</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Securing and Maintaining Funding for Glasgow&rsquo;s Sporting and Cultural Activities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the role that the city of Glasgow has played in showcasing the best of Scottish sport, culture and entertainment; welcomes recent success stories of the city, including the international reputation of the newly refurbished Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and the hosting of the 2007 UEFA Cup Final; recognises the potential that hosting the 2014 Commonwealth Games affords not only Glasgow but Scotland as a whole, and calls on the Scottish Government to acknowledge the need for additional metropolitan funding for the city of Glasgow to ensure that it has the resources required to enable it to meet the challenges coming from other cities from small nations across the world and to continue as a city that provides the best in sport, culture and entertainment for generations to come.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-527</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>National Police Memorial Day 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the service for National Police Memorial Day to be held in Edinburgh on Sunday 30 September 2007; remembers the nearly 4,000 police officers who have been killed or died on duty and whose names are recorded on the police Roll of Honour; reminds the relatives, friends and colleagues of fallen officers that their sacrifice is not forgotten, and recognises the dedication to duty and courage displayed by police officers throughout Scotland and the United Kingdom on a daily basis as they go about their duty to protect the public.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-492</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Action Against Human Trafficking</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Amnesty International campaign against all forms of human trafficking in the United Kingdom; recognises that victims of trafficking often exhibit the symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome, depression and anxiety, as well as evidence of physical harm; recognises that we now have a duty of care to all victims of trafficking regardless of nationality, and calls on the Scottish Government to show leadership in the implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings by implementing the provisions of the convention for which it has devolved responsibility to the highest standard and co-ordinating the great work that is already being undertaken by local authorities, police forces, non-governmental organisations and voluntary organisations to promote best practice, standardise levels of care and ensure consistency across Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-338#</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Warm Zones</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the excellent work of not-for-profit Warm Zones Ltd, set up with UK Government support in 2000 and operated by National Energy Action, the leading fuel poverty charity in England and Wales, working in partnership with local government, energy companies such as Transco and British Gas, European Union agencies and others; is aware that the Warm Zone project encourages a proactive approach to combating fuel poverty by going into communities to assess the energy efficiency and fuel poverty status of all households in an entire area, with a view to co-ordinating the free delivery of necessary energy efficiency improvements and related services; appreciates that the Warm Zone all area approach has been effective in reaching vulnerable households which often do not apply for available fuel benefits or grants; believes that, while so far warm zones have only been set up in England and Wales, Scotland with some 384,000 households, one in six, in fuel poverty can learn from the successes achieved south of the border; appreciates that in Gateshead alone warm zones invested &pound;2 million and warm zone teams visited 26,239 homes, carried out 21,067 assessments, surveyed 13,384 homes, installed energy efficiency measures in 9,996 homes and attracted &pound;400,000 extra in benefits for residents in the year to February 2007, attracting &pound;200,000 in European structural funding for job creation and training while reducing energy usage by an average of 40% and attaining a client satisfaction rating of over 97%, and concludes that an area like North Ayrshire, with an estimated 11,000 of 62,000 households in fuel poverty, would be an excellent place to undertake a warm zone project and ultimately supports the introduction of warm zones across Scotland, believing that discussions should take place between local authorities, Energy Action Scotland, the Scottish Government and other stakeholders about the establishment of warm zones north of the border as part of a concerted and systematic campaign to eradicate fuel poverty once and for all.</p>
