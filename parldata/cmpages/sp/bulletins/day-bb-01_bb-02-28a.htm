                        <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Discrimination Against Teaching 
                        Centres of Artistic Excellence</strong>—That the Parliament 
                        notes the decision of the Department for Education and 
                        Employment to introduce Dance and Drama Awards for students 
                        to study at institutions in England and Wales; is aware 
                        that Scottish students compete on equal terms for places 
                        at such institutions with their counterparts from other 
                        parts of the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU); 
                        is concerned that tuition fees are only paid if students 
                        study in England and Wales and regrets that no parallel 
                        funding scheme exists for students who wish to study in 
                        Scotland; believes that this discrimination against Scottish 
                        institutions can only harm them and in the case of Ballet 
                        West may force it out of business or to relocate from 
                        Taynuilt to outwith Scotland, to the detriment of the 
                        local economy and employment; notes that Ballet West attracts 
                        students from across the United Kingdom, the EU and as 
                        far afield as Guatemala, Japan and Malaysia and outperforms 
                        competitor schools from south of the border in ballet 
                        competitions and quality of training; is puzzled by the 
                        Minister for Children and Education’s view that &quot;there 
                        is no evidence of significant demand for Dance and Drama 
                        training for young people aged 16 and over in Scotland&quot; 
                        when 613 applications were received by Ballet West for 
                        23 places; regrets that 34 students withdrew or rejected 
                        offers from Ballet West due to lack of funding, compared 
                        with only two students doing so at English institutions; 
                        notes that the Excellence Fund supports and encourages 
                        talent secondary school dancers in Scotland but that the 
                        only progression into tertiary training encouraged by 
                        the Scottish Executive is in England; is concerned that 
                        Scotland will become denuded of teaching centres of artistic 
                        excellence and be drained of artistic talent as a result 
                        of this discrimination; believes the current position 
                        of the Scottish Executive on this issue contradicts its 
                        own cultural strategy that has as its key themes &quot;widening 
                        opportunities, promoting education, developing and celebrating 
                        excellence&quot; and believes that the Scottish Executive 
                        should act in order that students from across the UK can 
                        choose where to study dance, drama or stage management 
                        based on the quality of course offered rather than on 
                        whether or not tuition fees will be paid. </font></p>
