          <b>*S2M-3250</b> <b>Ms Sandra White:</b> <b>Implement the National Language Strategy</b>&mdash;That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to accelerate the timetable for introducing a national language strategy in Scotland as a means to improving access to services for Scotland&rsquo;s ethnic minority population; recognises that many people from an ethnic minority background have unequal access to a range of public services because of inadequate provision and the lack of a national language framework; notes that despite being part of the Executive&rsquo;s Partnership Agreement, signed in 2003, no apparent work on this strategy appears to have taken place, and finally further notes that the subsequent lack of strategy is leading to greater social exclusion, isolation and inequality among Scotland&rsquo;s ethnic minorities.<p></p><b>*S2M-3249</b> <b>Mr Mark Ruskell:</b> <b>Protection of Australian Old Growth Forest and Sustainable Timber Certification Standards</b>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the ongoing unsustainable and socially repressive practices of Gunns Ltd in respect of their forest operations in Tasmania; further condemns Gunns&rsquo; persistence in pursuing legal action against environmentalists and environmental groups; questions the legitimacy of the Australian Forestry Standard (AFS) as a reliable and credible certification of sustainability on the grounds that it permits the conversion of native forests for monoculture plantation, permits the use of 1080 poison (sodium monofluoroacetate) to kill native Australian wildlife, permits the use of high intensity burns of logged areas as standard practice, permits the destruction of old growth and high conservation value forests and permits habitat destruction that directly threatens biodiversity and the survival of listed endangered species; notes calls for a boycott of AFS products and Tamar Ridge Wines, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gunns Ltd, and calls on the Australian and Tasmanian Governments to pursue World Heritage listing for recognised World Heritage value forests and to protect old growth and high conservation value areas for current and future generations and to note that the Forest Stewardship Council provides an internationally-recognised standard for timber certification upon which its own AFS could be based.<p></p><b>*S2M-3248</b> <b>Shona Robison:</b> <b>Congratulations to the University of Dundee</b>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the pre-eminent role played by the University of Dundee in conducting biomedical research; notes the growing global reputation that the university enjoys as a consequence, particularly in the field of cancer research; congratulates University Principal, Alan Langlands, and his team on the award of a further &pound;11 million from Cancer Research UK to the University&rsquo;s Molecular Pharmacology Unit, and expresses its hope that the university will continue to cement its growing world reputation for cancer research by securing similar awards in the future.<p></p><b>S2M-3247#</b> <b>Helen Eadie:</b> <b>International Credit Union Day 2005</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that International Credit Union Day will take place on 20 October 2005; recognises that 2005 has been another continued year of growth for the credit union movement in Scotland; further notes that credit unions are now eligible to apply for services of general economic interest status, allowing for government funding to provide simple financial products targeted at the financially excluded;
