<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (u).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3406</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Life Expectancy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recently disclosed findings from the General Registrar Office for Scotland showing that people in Scotland are living longer, with the gap between the sexes closing, but is concerned that, yet again, the people with the shortest life expectancies live in Glasgow; is alarmed that a male child born in Glasgow has a life expectancy of only 69 years and four months, whereas a male child born in neighbouring East Dunbartonshire will, on average, live until he is 77; notes that Scotland, with its vast amount of natural resources and economic potential, should not exhibit this alarming regional variation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to act quickly to ensure that those living in Scotland&rsquo;s largest city do not continue to suffer simply because of where they live, to improve this abhorrent inequality and to be proactive about eliminating the poverty being experienced by Glaswegians which is, arguably, the root cause of these statistics.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3405</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, by Royal Charter of Queen Victoria on 11 May 1880, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales was established as a corporate body; also notes the unbroken global convention from Nova Scotia to Scotland, Ireland, South Africa, Guyana, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Manitoba, Jamaica, Bermuda, Prince Edward Island, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Nepal, Nigeria, the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand that chartered institutes carry their country of origin in their names; further notes the intention of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales to amend its title to &quot;The Institute of Chartered Accountants&quot;, creating market place confusion and asserting unjustified and inaccurate claims of pre-eminence, and calls on HM Privy Council not to approve the proposed name change.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3404</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>HER-2 Testing: Herceptin Treatment for Breast Cancer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Department of Health for announcing that all patients with breast cancer must be prospectively tested for HER-2 gene status; applauds Professor Mike Richards for meeting the leaders of all cancer networks in England to lay down a timetable so that all patients will be tested in readiness for the availability of Herceptin within the next six months; also congratulates the Scottish Executive for putting in place similar plans for Scotland; notes that the important emphasis now is that HER-2 testing, at the point of diagnosis, is vital to avoid progression of the disease into metastatic advancement, and recognises that approximately 805 HER-2 positive patients in Scotland could benefit from Herceptin, allowing them a better quality of life and perhaps a chance to live longer.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3403</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>General Teaching Council Lecture Presented by Baroness Warnock</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the General Teaching Council and Baroness Warnock for the thought-provoking lecture on 5 October 2005 on the issue of inclusion; recognises that this is an issue of concern for teachers and parents alike, and calls on the Executive to initiate an immediate review of the policy of inclusion in the education system, including resourcing.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3402</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>The Use of Teachers and Social Workers in the Removal of Asylum Seekers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that teachers and social workers may soon be required to oversee the removal of asylum seeker families from Scotland; acknowledges that the current situation whereby asylum seeker families are subjected to dawn raids and all they entail, including the dragging of children from their beds, the handcuffing of parents, giving parents 20 minutes to pack their belongings and the separation from friends, family, schools and community, is unacceptable; believes that it is not the job of teachers and social workers to take part in this cruel and unnecessary practice, dictated from the Home Office in London, which potentially sends people into danger, rape, torture, imprisonment and death; notes that a solution to these brutal dawn raids would be for the Scottish Executive to realise and harness the potential, positive impact, skills and much-needed population boost our asylum seekers bring to Scotland; considers that people who come to this country in pursuit of freedom, democracy and safety should be welcomed and encouraged, setting an example to the rest of the world in relation to basic humanity and compassion, and believes that the support that the Executive is proposing to provide for asylum seekers in preparing them for return to their home countries does not change the fact that they may still be subjected to torture and imprisonment when they arrive.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3401</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of the Crown Estate Commission at Annat Bay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit recommending that the Crown Estate Commission approves the application for a new salmon farm in Annat Bay, near Ullapool, overturning the democratic decision taken by Highland Council after extensive consultation with the local community; believes that it has made a mockery of the local democratic process by ignoring the views of the local community and its right to manage the local environment in its own way; notes that it is nearly three years since the Parliament voted for planning controls for marine fish farms to be transferred to local authorities; regrets the lack of urgency by the Scottish Executive in bringing into force the relevant section in the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003, and calls on it to end the interim measures as soon as possible and ensure that any decisions taken under interim arrangements can be reviewed by the democratically elected local authorities.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3400</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Aboyne Maternity Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the excellent work carried out by staff at Aboyne Hospital&rsquo;s maternity unit; notes that the number of mothers giving birth at Aboyne is increasing, with the number of deliveries rising from 34 in 2003 to 60 in 2004, and notes that the number of bookings has increased by 71 per cent for the coming year; agrees that the unit is an excellent example of health services being delivered locally as advocated by Professor David Kerr in his report, <em>Building a Health Service Fit for the Future</em>; further agrees that expectant mothers should have the option of giving birth locally, at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary or in the home; notes with concern the possibility of the unit being closed, and calls on NHS Grampian to work with local people to ensure that the unit remains open.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3399</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of Sir John Ward</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the comments of Sir John Ward, Chairman of Scottish Enterprise, at a briefing of MSPs on Wednesday 5 October 2005 when he stated that the economy of Ayrshire was like that of an Eastern European country and calls on the current Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning to direct Scottish Enterprise and Sir John Ward to undertake the commitments given by Jim Wallace, the then Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, to improve the economy of Ayrshire.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3398</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Breast Cancer: An Environmental Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication, and notes with grave concern the findings, of <em>Breast Cancer: an environmental disease - the case for primary prevention </em>by the UK Working Group on the Primary Prevention of Breast Cancer; notes that breast cancer is the most common cancer in the United Kingdom; further notes that the chances of women contracting breast cancer rose from one in 12 to one in nine in the five-year period from 1996 to 2001; takes note of the working group&rsquo;s assertion that breast cancer is a preventable rather than an inevitable disease; takes further note of the working group&rsquo;s emphasis on the significance of low-level, long-term and early-life exposures to environmental agents in promoting this disease and the need to reduce the production, release and use of toxic substances; notes with concern that the proposals submitted to the European Commission could end up moving the burden-of-proof responsibilities, envisaged in Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH), back to public authorities instead of to chemicals producers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to prioritise the primary prevention of breast cancer and to make representations to ensure that the REACH regime can provide an adequate regulatory framework to assist with the prevention of breast cancer and other diseases with environmental components.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3394</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Improve Broiler Chicken Welfare</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the intensive farming of chicken for meat production is one of the least regulated areas of food production within the whole livestock industry; notes that immense suffering, including lameness and brittle bones, can be caused to broiler chickens through genetic selection for fast growth and high stocking densities; believes that the proposed EU directive on the welfare of broiler chickens is a welcome first step in the raising of broiler chicken welfare standards across the whole European Union (EU), and calls on the Scottish Executive to urge the UK Government to use its Presidency of the EU to demand genuine improvements in broiler chicken welfare.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3393#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Estonian Days in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament extends a warm welcome to those taking part in &quot;Estonian Days in Scotland&quot;, which is being held from 1 to 9 November 2005 at venues all over Scotland; believes that the extensive programme of events covering business development, cultural and sporting links is a worthy successor to the successful Scottish week in Tallinn, Estonia, that was organised in 2004; welcomes, in particular, the Foreign Minister and Culture Minister from the Estonian Government to Scotland and hopes that their visits are successful in broadening the political and cultural links between our two countries in the future; notes that Estonian and Scottish businesses have been quick to recognise the benefits to both countries in a closer relationship, and hopes that this will continue to grow in the years ahead as our small nations work together to develop fresh markets throughout the European Union and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3391</strong>u <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Common Good Funds - Where are They?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the existence of many local common good funds, such as those in Peebles and other Borders towns, comprising movable and heritable property and revenues but notes that there is often no comprehensive inventory of those assets which might not even be insured; notes that these often have considerable monetary as well as historic value; notes further that there are recorded instances of disposals of common good assets which should not have occurred, and considers therefore, as a first step, that the Scottish Executive should require local authorities to provide, as soon as practicable, a publicly accessible inventory of those common good assets in their stewardship.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3390</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Maternity Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the public consultation process on the reform of maternity services in Glasgow; notes that NHS Greater Glasgow attempted to rule out all but one of the potential sites for the new maternity hospital at a recent public meeting; notes that the independent group, chaired by Professor Calder, which is tasked with selecting the final site, appears to have a difficult job in light of this decision as their options have been limited; further notes the Minister for Health and Community Care&rsquo;s statement that &quot;I will decide what happens on these services, not Greater Glasgow Health Board&quot; and believes that it is his duty to ensure that the process is more open and transparent than it has been to date and that all the relevant information regarding the resiting of the children&rsquo;s hospital in Glasgow is considered by the independent group chaired by Professor Calder, and further believes that transport links and the future of Ronald McDonald House must also be given careful consideration.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3388</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Population Deficit and Glasgow School Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive for all and any initiatives it takes to reverse the skills and population deficit in Scotland; recognises that a dwindling population is an economic time bomb which threatens health, education, social work and many other essential services which the people of Scotland will surely always rely on; looks forward to toasting the success of the Executive in this extremely important challenge; expresses concern that if the Executive is successful there will not be enough schools in Glasgow to educate its growing young population if Glasgow City Council proceeds with its current plans to cut back on and close schools throughout the city; notes that this includes 51 primaries, 22 pre-five centres, four special educational needs units and one bilingual support unit, and finally is concerned that this measure shows little confidence on the part of Labour-led Glasgow City Council in the success of the Executive&rsquo;s initiatives.</p>
<p>Supported by: Frances Curran, Ms Sandra White, Carolyn Leckie</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3387</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Treatment for Mild Depression</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that spending on anti-depressant prescribing is 40% higher in Scotland than in England; recognises that the recent English National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline on depression found non-pharmacological treatments to be at least as effective as anti-depressants in the treatment of mild depression, and supports the proposal from Depression Alliance Scotland that a SIGN guideline on the non-pharmacological treatment of mild to moderate depression in adults in primary care should be developed for Scotland as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3386</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Freedom of Glasgow for Harry Benson</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the immense contribution of Harry Benson, one of Glasgow&rsquo;s most famous sons and one of the world&rsquo;s foremost photographers; agrees that his images of some of the most famous people and historic events of the second half of the 20th century are a priceless record of those decades; believes that, in recognition of his contribution to art, photography and historical record, the city of Glasgow should honour his lifetime of achievement, and calls on Glasgow City Council to award Harry Benson the freedom of the city.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3384#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Haddington Citizens Advice Bureau</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of citizens advice bureaux throughout Scotland, of which Haddington Citizens Advice Bureau is typical; notes that in 2004-05 it opened 2,015 new cases with an increase in drop-in and telephone access and that &pound;117,083 was secured for clients, but that premises and funding for staff continue to be its main priorities for service development; notes with concern the increasing demand for the Money Advice Service, with the level of debt increased by 25% from the previous year making more demands on the service; is most concerned that this service is now stretched to its limits; further notes with regret that the Good Advice Better Health Clinics in Berwick, Cockenzie, Port Seton and Tranent have lost continuation funding and that the hours of the Project Worker at the one GP Advice Clinic in Dunbar have been reduced from 25 to seven per week when 56 patients accessed this service, there were 177 contacts from third parties and &pound;26,685 was secured for clients from a small investment in the service of &pound;6,500; considers that all of these services are invaluable to individuals and the community at large, and considers that the Scottish Executive should reconsider their funding now.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Sandra White</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3383</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Water Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that monies should be made available in the forthcoming investment period to deal with the backlog of historic under-investment in assets and infrastructure in the water industry; recognises that the impact of not dealing with this backlog could result in much greater costs in future and a large increase in water charges in the next review period; calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that Scottish Water is given adequate funding to fulfil its core functions, including promoting sustainable development and meeting obligations for biodiversity within the charge caps proposed by the Water Industry Commissioner, and further calls for all Executive objectives, essential and desirable, to be delivered to achieve a degree of compliance with environmental regulation.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3382</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Justice for Co-op Financial Advisers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the actions of the Co-operative Insurance Society in writing to over 2,000 of its financial advisers, threatening to sack them if they do not sign up to new terms and conditions; notes with concern that these new terms and conditions could lead to earnings being reduced by around 30% and that refusal to accept these conditions could lead to employees receiving dismissal notices from 17 October 2005; is further concerned that the employer has refused to agree to binding arbitration which has been offered by Usdaw, the trade union representing the threatened workers; offers support and solidarity with the Usdaw members who have now voted in favour of strike action with a two-to-one majority; agrees with the workers that the Co-op&rsquo;s intractability has left them with no other option; believes that the Co-op&rsquo;s actions in this dispute bring its reputation as an ethical and esteemed community-based co-operative organisation into disrepute, such action being more in keeping with the activities of multi-national corporations against workers in Latin American countries such as Colombia, and urges the company to, at the very least, agree to the compromise offered by Usdaw members of entering into binding arbitration talks or, at best, withdraw these threats of dismissal and maintain fair and favourable terms and conditions for all of its employees.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3378</strong> <strong>Kate Maclean:</strong> <strong>Guide Dogs for the Blind Re-think Rehab</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association on the launch of its Re-think Rehab campaign; recognises that rehabilitation workers currently play a crucial role in enabling blind and partially sighted people to live safe and independent lives; notes that there is a major shortage in the number of properly qualified rehabilitation workers to deliver training to visually impaired people in Scotland, with 30% not holding the necessary level of qualifications to do the job; acknowledges that 15% of Scottish local authorities have no dedicated services for blind and partially sighted people; expresses dismay that many blind and partially sighted people in Scotland are not able to lead the active, independent lives that other people take for granted; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s eye healthcare review and the work carried out so far by it to assess the adequacy of social care services for sensory impaired users and is grateful for the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to provide short-term contingency measures to shore up the shortfall of qualified rehabilitation workers, and looks forward to the early implementation of this commitment together with the finding and funding of long-term solutions to improve the rehabilitation services on offer for blind and partially sighted people.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3376</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Opposition to Nuclear Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament states its total opposition to nuclear power as a means of energy production; totally opposes any suggestion of building new nuclear power stations in Scotland; acknowledges that recent research, in a UK context, suggests that nuclear power would produce about 50 per cent more global warming emissions than wind power and that nuclear power does not hold any financial benefits compared with the development of renewable energy; accepts that the technology of nuclear power is intimately connected with the technology used to make nuclear weapons and that nuclear facilities are uniquely vulnerable to terrorist attack; recognises that nuclear power produces waste which remains dangerous for tens of thousands of years and that nuclear power leads to radioactive discharges into the seas and atmosphere; notes the recent report from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority which estimates that decommissioning costs could be up to &pound;56 billion, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to state categorically that no nuclear power stations will be built in Scotland.</p>
