          <p><strong>*S1M-2805 Mr Brian Monteith: </strong>Edinburgh Institute 
            for the Study of the Arab World and Islam-That the Parliament notes 
            the publication of the annual newsletter of the Edinburgh Institute 
            for the Study of the Arab World and Islam and congratulates it on 
            the accomplishment of 250 years of teaching Arabic and Islamic Studies 
            in Scotland; believes that it is a tribute to the University of Edinburgh 
            that the department has been awarded a five star rating in the recent 
            Research Assessment Exercise, and wishes it every success in attracting 
            more students to these studies.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2804</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: The College of 
            Piping</strong>-That the Parliament notes with pleasure the recent 
            &pound;300,000 end of year flexibility grant to the Piping Centre 
            in Glasgow; regrets, however, that once again the College of Piping, 
            which has been in existence since 1944, currently has more than 150 
            pupils on its register and maintains a teaching network covering the 
            whole of Scotland, has failed to receive similar support, and therefore 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to consider distributing financial 
            support to such bodies in a fairer and more equitable way.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2803</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Fair Trade Fortnight</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a id="MotionText"
name="MotionText">warmly welcomes Fair Trade Fortnight (4-17 March 2002); believes 
            that Fair Trade activity, encouraged as it is by Oxfam Scotland and 
            other non-governmental organisations and agencies, performs a valuable 
            role in assisting with the setting up of women's co-operatives, small 
            businesses and village enterprises throughout the developing world 
            which provide important economic and social assistance to the families 
            and communities of those involved in such productive activities, and 
            commends the shops and stores which sell Fair Trade products and individual 
            shoppers, local authorities, schools and churches who buy such products.</a></p>
