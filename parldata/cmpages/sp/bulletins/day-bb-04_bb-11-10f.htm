          <p><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1984</strong> <STRONG>Peter Peacock:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fostering</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament, in acknowledging that children thrive best in strong families, recognises the important role that foster carers play in providing a supportive and loving family environment for many of our most vulnerable children and welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s intention to invest in the future of the fostering service to increase the number of high quality placements and give local authorities resources to establish a fair and consistent system of allowances for foster carers.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Supported by: Euan Robson<STRONG>*</strong></font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1983</strong> <STRONG>Mr Mark Ruskell:</STRONG> <STRONG>National Farmers Union Scotland and Fair Trade</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the National Farmers Union Scotland in its campaign for fair trade with supermarkets; is alarmed at the power of supermarkets to dictate prices below production costs of milk and other products; agrees that a code of practice for retailers needs to be made compulsory and enforceable and that a lack of contracts between supermarkets, processors and suppliers is a major problem that needs to be rectified; believes that there should be a fair trade inquiry into the practices engaged in by supermarkets in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to report on the effect such practices have on the rural economy and environment and the livelihoods of people and communities dependent on agriculture.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1982</strong> <STRONG>Iain Smith on behalf of the Procedures Committee:</STRONG> <STRONG>Timescales and Stages of Bills</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Procedures Committee&rsquo;s 7th Report, 2004 (Session 2), <EM>Timescales and Stages of Bills</EM> (SP Paper 228), and agrees that the changes to Standing Orders set out in Annexe A to the report be made with effect from 10 January 2005.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Supported by: Karen Gillon<STRONG>*</strong></font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1981</strong> <STRONG>Alex Fergusson:</STRONG> <STRONG>National Beef Envelope</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision to introduce a national beef envelope as part of the reform of Common Agricultural Policy, despite the overwhelming objections to such a measure by the majority of stakeholders; believes that the decision should be reviewed after one year with a view to abolishing the measure and, if the measure is not then abolished, the criteria should be altered to include beef from the dairy herd, and notes that the dairy sector will be contributing to the scheme through modulation whilst deriving no benefit from it, thus further disadvantaging a sector at a time when its financial returns are at an all-time low.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1978</strong> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Co-operation between Parliament and Civil Servants</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Scottish Executive to form a working group composed of representatives of MSPs, ministers and civil servants to examine ways in which the Parliament and Executive ministers and civil servants could work together constructively, possibly in smaller specialist groups, to develop policy, improve public services, promote economic activity and community life and raise the quality of life, without compromising parties&rsquo; right to take up different positions and criticise each other, the independence of the Parliament and the Executive or the particular relationship between ministers and civil servants.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1977</strong> <STRONG>Margaret Smith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Edinburgh Airport Rail Link</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament supports a comprehensive rail link to Edinburgh Airport; recognises that the consultation period has started and welcomes the opportunity for people to input their views; believes that value for money and impact of construction concerns must be taken into account; nonetheless believes that direct rail links to Edinburgh Airport from Fife, Glasgow and other parts of Scotland have the potential to benefit the local, regional and national economy, increase the number of people travelling by public transport to the airport, reduce congestion, improve integrated transport in west Edinburgh and tackle pollution; therefore condemns the Scottish Green Party&rsquo;s opposition to the airport rail link; believes that its policy of renationalising the railways is not a current remedy for tackling congestion or air pollution, and further believes that it is the delivery of new and improved public transport links that will improve Scotland&rsquo;s environment.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1976</strong> <STRONG>Margaret Mitchell:</STRONG> <STRONG>Just One Click in Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the one-day conference held on 9 November 2004 by Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland aimed at promoting the safety of children online; congratulates Barnardo&rsquo;s for continuing to highlight this important issue and spread awareness of the dangers; notes that there is a lack of available data about the extent of internet grooming in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to undertake research into the scale of the problem and to carry out a high-profile awareness campaign alerting parents and young people to the dangers of grooming over the internet and mobile phones.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1975</strong> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Midlothian Council&rsquo;s Proposals to Boundary Commission</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament views with concern Midlothian Council&rsquo;s proposals to the Boundary Commission for six wards of three members each in respect of the new STV elections for local government; believes that this will not deliver proportionality in the spirit of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, and would express regret if this proposal represented an attempt by the Scottish Labour Party to subvert proportionality for local government.</font></p>
