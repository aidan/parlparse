          <p align="left"><strong>*S1M-2197</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Parthenon Marbles</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the recent constructive proposals by the Greek 
            Government for the return of the Parthenon Marbles to Greece in advance 
            of the Olympic Games to be held there in 2004, which involve putting 
            aside the issue of ownership and instead entering into a partnership 
            to ensure that the marbles are displayed and conserved in the best 
            possible way; further notes that the Greek Government is willing to 
            enter a rolling loan agreement so that other artefacts of great significance 
            which have never before been seen in the UK can be displayed in the 
            British Museum; regrets that Her Majesty's Government has not yet 
            responded to these positive proposals, and hopes that Her Majesty's 
            Government will at last recognise the justice of the Greek case and 
            will help the Greek Government to mark the return of the Olympics 
            to their nation with a cultural gesture of world significance.</p>
          <p align="left"><strong>*S1M-2196</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Appointment of Lesley 
            Hynds to Health Education Board for Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament 
            expresses its concern at the appointment of Lesley Hynds as Chairman 
            of the Health Education Board for Scotland; questions whether she 
            has the necessary experience and expertise for this job; believes 
            that this is another example of Labour cronyism; calls on the Health 
            and Community Care Committee to hold an inquiry into the appropriateness 
            of this appointment and on the Commissioner for Public Appointments 
            to investigate whether the proper appointment procedures were followed, 
            and believes that this confirms the need for the Parliament to be 
            given the power to vet and, where necessary, veto public appointments, 
            as set out in the Public Appointments (Parliamentary Approval) Bill 
            (Scotland) which has been introduced in the Parliament.</p>
          <p align="left"><strong>*S1M-2195</strong> <strong>Mr John Farquhar Munro: Agriculture 
            Environmental Biotechnology Commission Report on GM Crop Trials</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the report, <i>Crops on Trial</i>, by the 
            Agriculture Environmental Biotechnology Commission; notes that the 
            report questions whether farm scale evaluations are adequate for deciding 
            whether GM crops should be grown commercially, and urges the Scottish 
            Executive to carry out an immediate study of the report's recommendations 
            and adjust its policy on GM farm trials accordingly.</p>

            were held unlawfully at the Oakington detention centre and that their

            are not criminals and therefore should not be imprisoned, and agrees 
            to close the Dungavel detention centre and ensure that no asylum seeker 
            is imprisoned for seeking asylum as such action is not a crime.</a></p>
