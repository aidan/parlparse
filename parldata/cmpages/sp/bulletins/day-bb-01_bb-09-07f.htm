            business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2185</strong> <strong>Mr John Farquhar Munro: Sodexho's Commitment 
            on Asylum Seekers</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the written commitment 
            Sodexho has made that it and its subsidiary UK Detention Services 
            will not attempt to circumvent their legal obligation to pay the minimum 
            wage; acknowledges the specific pledge that no agreement has been 
            or will be entered into with Her Majesty's Government to avoid paying 
            the minimum wage to asylum seekers in its charge and that no obligation 
            will be placed upon any asylum seeker to work at the proposed detention 
            centre, and is grateful that both MSPs and staff will, once again, 
            be able to enjoy the catering services provided to the Parliament 
            by Sodexho with a clear conscience.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2184#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Contract Research Staff</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises that contract research staff in Scotland's 
            universities and research institutes are one of the most significant 
            assets in Scotland's knowledge economy; notes that more than 90% of 
            such staff are employed on insecure fixed term contracts, resulting 
            in a systematic failure to properly exploit our science and social 
            science base to the benefit of the Scottish economy and society; further 
            notes that this highly educated human resource, comprising graduate, 
            postgraduate and postdoctoral level workers, is subject to constant 
            wastage, to the detriment of Scotland's universities and economic 
            potential, and believes that the Scottish Executive should act with 
            clarity, urgency and determination to secure a complete overhaul of 
            the management of the contract research workforce with a view to eliminating 
            the current insecurity and wastage and establishing a radical new 
            approach in partnership with higher education employers and representatives 
            of the research staff.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2183</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Thanks to Dr Krishna Goel, 
            Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament 
            records its profound gratitude to Dr Krishna Goel for his 36 years 
            of outstanding service to the children of Scotland through his devoted 
            work at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow; records that 
            his work as a consultant paediatrician has benefited many thousands 
            of children over the decades since he left Lucknow for Glasgow, courageously 
            entering a new country to become one of Scotland's most respected 
            and beloved citizens, loved by his patients not only for his exceptional 
            skill but also for his immense kindness; notes that his patients and 
            colleagues are grateful that he will continue a clinic after his forthcoming 
            retirement; commends Dr Goel for his work for the Children's Hospice 
            Movement, his authorship involving 10 textbooks and papers and his 
            service on 11 medical and fund-raising committees, and regards Dr 
            Krishna Goel B.Sc. Lucknow, M.B.B.S., D.C.H., M.D., M.R.C.P. (UK), 
            Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, 
            Fellow of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of Edinburgh and London 
            and Fellow and Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Paediatrics 
            and Child Health, as an inspiring example of what is too often overlooked, 
            namely the benefits of immigration.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2182</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Tobacco Advertising and Promotion 
            Bill</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the introduction in the House 
            of Lords on 12 July 2001 of the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion 
            Bill by the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Clement-Jones; notes that the 
            Bill is identical to the Bill which received 3rd<sup> </sup>reading 
            support in the House of Commons on 13 February 2001; further notes 
            that this new Bill encompasses the whole of the UK and will allow 
            for a more comprehensive suppression of tobacco advertising than any 
            similar Bill passed solely for Scotland by this Parliament, and urges 
            Her Majesty's government to give support to Lord Clement-Jones' Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2181</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Shipyard Workers</strong>-That the 
            Parliament acknowledges the strength of feeling expressed by the workforce 
            at the Scotstoun shipyard in their strike action against the threat 
            to 1,000 jobs there; notes that despite seven meetings with the trade 
            union side since July 2001, BAe Systems has failed to give the workforce 
            any confidence in the security of their jobs, and calls on BAe Systems 
            to address this issue as a matter of extreme urgency.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2179</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh: Report into Hospital-Acquired 
            Infection</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the report into hospital-acquired 
            infection (HAI) by Dr Andrew Walker of the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics 
            at Glasgow University; expresses concern at its findings which estimate 
            that the cost to the NHS in Scotland of treating HAI is in excess 
            of £101 million per year and could be as high as £186 million; notes 
            that this figure is five times higher than that estimated by the Scottish 
            Executive, and urges the Executive to take action on these findings 
            as a matter of priority.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2178</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: The Draft Criminal Legal Aid 
            (Scotland) (Prescribed Proceedings) Amendment Regulations 2001</strong>-That 
            the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the draft Criminal Legal Aid 
            (Scotland) (Prescribed Proceedings) Amendment Regulations 2001 be 
            approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Iain Gray<strong>*</strong></p>

            Regulations 2001</strong>-That the Justice 1 Committee recommends 
            that the draft Advice and Assistance (Assistance by way of Representation) 
            (Scotland) Amendment (No.3) Regulations 2001 be approved.</p>
