<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3708</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Young People&rsquo;s Health Advisory Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland (SCCYP) and NHS Scotland on their joint event at the Parliament on 12 March 2009, which highlighted and showcased the work of the Young People&rsquo;s Health Advisory Group (YPHAG); notes that this joint initiative between SCCYP and NHS Education for Scotland on behalf of NHS Scotland enables young people to input to health issues and act as a sounding board on health policy development; was pleased to welcome the YPHAG members, Heather Turnbull, Gary Buchanan, Jenny Hart, Stuart McNally and Jamie Ross, to the Parliament to talk about their work and why they think that it is important to involve young people in the design and delivery of healthcare and health services; acknowledges that listening to young people and taking their opinions into account ultimately leads to better decisions; notes that this pilot is now coming to an end, and hopes that the good work will be built on and taken forward with the establishment of similar groups in each of the NHS boards in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3707</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>The Local Government Finance Act 1992 (Scotland) Amendment Order 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government Finance Act 1992 (Scotland) Amendment Order 2009 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3706</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Primark&rsquo;s New Ethical Trading Director</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the appointment of Katherine Kirk as Primark&rsquo;s first ever Ethical Trading Director; notes that, since being ranked the least ethical of the main clothing stores in 2005 by <em>Ethical Consumer</em> magazine, Primark has raised its rank to the upper half of the league table; notes with concern the ongoing investigation by the Ethical Trading Initiative into Primark&rsquo;s use of child labour in India but acknowledges the appointment as a basic step forward in ending human rights abuses and poverty wages in its supply chain, and calls on Primark to continue demonstrating its new-found commitment to ethics reform through firm actions and results, not simply through job appointments.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3705</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Sale of Stonehaven Radio Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the poor state of repair that Stonehaven Radio Station has fallen into since its closure in 2000, despite its status as a listed building and its unique history; applauds the efforts of the Stonehaven Maritime Radio Heritage Halls charity to purchase and preserve the site as a museum and community building, and calls on British Telecommunications PLC and Telereal to recognise the social value to the local community that the buildings could have and to enter sale negotiations with Stonehaven Maritime Radio Heritage Halls before placing the site on the open market.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3704</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>UN Report Criticises UK over Torture Cases</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern following the publication of a UN report by Martin Scheinin, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, which is highly critical of the UK Government for breaching basic human rights, trying to conceal illegal acts from bodies or judicial authorities in its counter-terrorism activities and using the threat of terrorism to switch from ordinary law enforcement to the use of special intelligence agencies so as to circumvent necessary safeguards in a democratic society, abusing thereby the usually legitimate secrecy of intelligence operations; agrees with the conclusion of special rapporteur Scheinin that the active or passive participation by states in the interrogation of persons held by another state constitutes an internationally wrongful act if the state knew or ought to have known that that the person was facing a real risk of torture or other prohibited treatment, and calls on the UK Government to launch an immediate inquiry into the role of UK security and intelligence officials in the US intelligence service&rsquo;s secret transfer of detainees to &quot;black sites&quot; around the world.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3699&diams; </strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that retained firefighters provide an invaluable service to communities across Scotland, particularly those in remote and rural areas, such as the north east and Highlands and Islands; believes that setting a 48-hour maximum to the working week as currently proposed in relation to retained firefighters could greatly reduce the hours for which they would be available for duty, to the detriment of fire services in many remote and rural communities; recognises the concerns raised by the Retained Firefighters Union in relation to the recent European Parliament vote to end the UK opt-out to the EU working time directive; agrees with the STUC and Fire Brigades Union that, as the issue is now subject to negotiations at European level, there is no immediate threat to fire provision, and hopes that the mature and responsible joint efforts by the Scottish and UK governments will ensure that any future changes to the EU working time directive ensure the flexibility required to allow the continuation of retained firefighters and the protection of workers&rsquo; rights.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3655</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Cemetery Memorabilia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that Fife Council leaders and officials have enforced strict regulations relating to the size and area that can be used for cemetery memorabilia with little consultation with the community and with great insensitivity towards the feelings of the bereaved; is particularly appalled that these leaders and officials refused to represent or hear the concerns of the community at two public meetings; notes that this is an issue of concern, not just in Fife, but in other areas also; regrets that this enforcement of regulations is based on financial motivations, has no regard for care or compassion and is seen by any reasonable person as wholly heartless; is particularly aghast that one family, whose children are buried in Fife, feels so aggrieved at these regulations that it is seriously considering exhuming the bodies of its loved ones and relocating them to its own property, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene urgently to stop these callous activities by Fife Council and to ensure that all councils across Scotland are given guidance so that they can be caring and listening councils.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3625.1</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>25th Anniversary of the Miners&rsquo; Strike</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3625) in the name of Jamie Hepburn, leave out from &quot;; regrets&quot; to end and insert &quot;with the eventual outcome ensuring that the country would thereafter be governed by the Government as opposed to a collection of militant trade union barons and left wing rabble-rousers; considers that the ballot-less and illegal strikes were rightly opposed at the time by the Labour party under the leadership of Neil Kinnock and urges everyone to reflect on this fact before attempting to rewrite history for political advantage; fully acknowledges the suffering experienced by local communities during this period but also considers that the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) busied itself concealing millions of pounds that could have been used to ameliorate this suffering in order to avoid potential sequestration as a consequence of its illegal actions; believes that Arthur Scargill was directly and personally responsible for the demise of the NUM and therefore finds it deeply ironic that he remains Life President of the NUM to this day; welcomes the fact that this period of economic restructuring transformed the country into a fully fledged, modern, free market economy subsequently used as a blueprint for success the world over, and therefore pays tribute to the Thatcher government for having had the determination, resolve and foresight to make these reforms when it did and for the period of unprecedented economic expansion, wealth creation and personal and economic liberty that followed.&quot;</p>
