          <p><strong>*S1M-2530</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon: Railtrack and the 
            Larkhall Project</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with dismay 
            the decision by Railtrack plc not to support the Scottish Executive 
            funded rail link between Larkhall and Milngavie; recognises that this 
            decision has the potential to have a particular impact on Larkhall 
            and the surrounding communities as it jeopardises the future of a 
            joint project between the Scottish Executive and Strathclyde Passenger 
            Transport; re-iterates its view that this project would have brought 
            substantial economic and social benefits to Clydesdale, and urges 
            Railtrack plc to reconsider urgently their decision in order to ensure 
            that this project proceeds as planned to enable the economic and social 
            regeneration of the Larkhall area. </p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2529#</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon: New Lanark</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the significant contribution that New Lanark 
            has made to the social, cultural and educational fabric of Scotland; 
            congratulates the New Lanark Conservation Trust on the excellent work 
            that it has done in restoring the village to its natural beauty, and 
            calls on UNESCO to grant the village full World Heritage Status.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2528#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Young Runaways</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the report <i>Missing Out &#150; Young Runaways 
            in Scotland</i>; commends the University of York, Aberlour Child Care 
            Trust, Extern, Children&#146;s Promise and The Children&#146;s Society 
            for producing this report, the most extensive piece of research yet 
            undertaken into young people under 16 who run away or are forced to 
            leave home; notes that this is the first comprehensive research to 
            provide both an overall picture of the scale and extent of the problem 
            while suggesting workable strategies for responding to the needs of 
            this very vulnerable group of young people, and asks the Executive 
            to look closely at the findings and recommendations of the report 
            and act accordingly. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2527</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Sentencing for 
            Breach of the Peace at Faslane Blockade</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            condemns the disgraceful three month prison sentence handed down to 
            Jenny Gaiawyn on 29 November 2001 by Sheriff Morag Galbraith for a 
            breach of the peace at the blockade in February 2001 of the Faslane 
            nuclear base; considers this sentence to be an outrageous attack on 
            this young woman&#146;s human right to protest peacefully, which is 
            a fundamental human right enshrined in the European Convention on 
            Human Rights and as such should be upheld in law; further considers 
            the sentence to be a scandalous reflection of the arbitrariness of 
            the Scottish legal system, and calls on the Minister for Justice to 
            set up an inquiry into the inconsistencies of sentencing in the courts, 
            which have seen people acquitted, fined or even sentenced to a prison 
            term for the same &quot;crime&quot; of breach of the peace.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2526</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Breastfeeding 
            Clinic at Yorkhill, Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">congratulates 
            the Queen Mother's Hospital at Yorkhill NHS Trust in establishing 
            Scotland's first breastfeeding clinic where breastfeeding mothers 
            can attend every Monday between 8.00 am and 6.00 pm without an appointment; 
            notes that this is the first open clinic of its kind in Scotland, 
            and supports the encouragement which the clinic will offer to mothers 
            to continue breastfeeding beyond the initial two weeks in order to 
            benefit both their health and that of the baby.</a></p>
