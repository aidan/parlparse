    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-1152#</b> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Ending EU Tobacco Subsidies</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament condemns the continuing European Union (EU) subsidy of some £800 million
    annually to tobacco growers; notes that this is in stark contrast to the tiny sums spent
    on EU smoking prevention initiatives of £1.2 million per annum; believes that EU tobacco
    subsidies are a gross misuse of public funds and reflect a fundamental contradiction to EU
    public health policy; notes that tobacco subsidies have failed in their original intention
    of encouraging farmers to grow commercially valued varieties of tobacco and thus reduce
    imports, as EU grown tobacco is of poor quality and low commercial value; recognises that
    almost all EU grown tobacco is exported to Central and Eastern Europe and developing
    countries where there are insufficient controls on tar content; notes that 10-20 million
    people could be fed by food crops grown instead of tobacco, and believes that the EU
    should begin a phased removal of all tobacco subsidies, using the money thus saved to give
    farmers direct income support while encouraging crop diversification, early retirement and
    other safety net schemes.</p>
