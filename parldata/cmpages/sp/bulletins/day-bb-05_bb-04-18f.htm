          <p align="center"><strong> Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

          <p align="center"><strong> New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
          <p><strong> * <strong>S2M-2710</strong> Rosie Kane: Dissent is not Dishonest or Dangerous</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns Phil Gallie MSP&rsquo;s misleading and inaccurate quotes regarding the activities at the recent Festival of Dissent in Lanarkshire, which stated that Dissent is &ldquo;involved in this kind of deceitful, dishonest and dangerous activity&rdquo;; recognises that Dissent met to plan resistance to the G8 summit, to further educate themselves and to build and discuss better ways of living and working together with their local communities; is concerned, however, that as Dissent was meeting to plan peaceful non-violent direct action against the forthcoming G8 summit at Gleneagles, police were preparing for violence at a nearby &ldquo;boot camp&rdquo; in Carluke and spent public money to deploy a helicopter to hover over the festival which was in stark contrast to the peaceful festival organised by Dissent; congratulates Dissent for its efforts and its openness, and hopes that the media, politicians and police will focus on the positive and peaceful activities being planned by those opposing the violent and negative activities of G8 members. </p>
          <p><strong> * <strong>S2M-2709</strong> Ms Rosemary Byrne: Lothian and Borders Progress 2 Work Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lothian and Borders Progress 2 Work Project for its success in placing 100 people in work and its commitment to helping to reintegrate people with a history of drug misuse into employment; notes that there are many more clients attending training courses and college, and congratulates this Jobcentre Plus initiative, partnered with Apex Scotland and Phoenix House.</p>
          <p><strong> * <strong>S2M-2708</strong> Roseanna Cunningham on behalf of the Health Committee: Access to Dental Services in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends to the Scottish Executive the research report, <em>Access to Dental Health Services in Scotland </em>(SP Paper 277)<em>,</em> commissioned by the Health Committee; draws the Executive&rsquo;s attention to the problems of access to services that the report identifies and their implications for the introduction of free dental checks, and urges the Executive to use the report to inform the implementation of its dental strategy.</p>
