          <p><strong>*S1M-2989</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Domestic Abuse 
            Courts</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the call by Lord Carloway 
            for the setting up of specialist courts to deal with domestic abuse; 
            notes the effectiveness of this system in dealing with the root causes 
            as well as the symptoms of domestic abuse along with programmes to 
            tackle abusive behaviour as demonstrated in Canada; further notes 
            the cluster courts set up in Leeds which have helped to speed up the 
            court process for cases involving domestic abuse and have made those 
            abused more willing to come forward due to the support they receive 
            and the clear message that is given that abuse is not acceptable, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to make the changes necessary 
            to set up these specialist courts in Scotland which will be able to 
            deal with both criminal and civil matters relating to the family.</p>

            Week, 12-19 May 2002 </strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges Autism 
            Awareness Week 2002 and the forthcoming Autism Awareness Week 2003 
            by supporting both the Scottish Society for Autism and the National 
            Autistic Society in Scotland in their efforts to promote and care 
            for those affected by the condition and notes the incredible amount 
            of work carried out by the very effective network of smaller support 
            groups.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2987#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: International 
            Workers' Memorial Day 28 April 2002</strong>-That the Parliament supports 
            International Workers' Memorial Day on 28 April 2002, a date important 
            to trade unionists the world over; notes that, every year, over 1.3 
            million workers across the world die from accidents and diseases at 
            work, nearly twice the number of deaths caused by war; further notes 
            that many such deaths could be prevented by better health and safety 
            management; welcomes the theme of occupational health in this year's 
            activities, and believes that Members should actively support this 
            important day by wearing the purple ribbon.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2986#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: STUC Emergency Motion 
            on Prison Privatisation</strong>-That the Parliament supports the 
            Scottish Trade Union Congress's emergency motion on prison privatisation 
            which backs the findings contained in <em>Privatised Prisons and Detention 
            Centres in Scotland: An Independent Report </em>by Phil Taylor and 
            Christine Cooper; believes that the Scottish Executive should consider 
            seriously how this report impacts on the Scottish Prison Service estates 
            review; agrees that it is hard to believe that three new public prisons 
            would cost £700 million more to build and run than three new private 
            prisons, and calls for a full public debate on the philosophy and 
            financial implications of prison privatisation.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2985</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Dumfries and Galloway 
            Managed Clinical Network for Heart Disease</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises that the Dumfries and Galloway Managed Clinical Network 
            for Heart Disease was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom 
            and is a way of focusing and providing care across the boundaries 
            between general practice and hospital and between different health 
            professions with a focus on patients and their needs; notes that, 
            although the network has only been in existence for nine months, it 
            is having a tremendous impact on the quality of care provided, with 
            patients, doctors and nurses involved actively in decision-making 
            about the future of service and on the use of scarce resources; further 
            notes that the pre-hospital thrombolysis service in the area was also 
            the first of its kind in the United Kingdom and will allow life-saving 
            clot-dissolving drugs to be given to patients suffering from a heart 
            attack before they get to hospital, and congratulates all those who 
            have been involved in Dumfries and Galloway in bringing about these 
            cutting edge developments in health services provision.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2982.1</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Housing Improvement

            its second stage report; seeks clarification as to when publication 
            of the second stage report is anticipated, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to propose that time is provided in the parliamentary process 
            to ensure that any necessary legislation that may emerge will be progressed 
            prior to the end of this session of the Parliament.&quot; </p>

            Task Force; regrets that this report contains many vague and often 
            contradictory conclusions, and expresses the hope that future reports

            aimed at addressing the significant problems of housing quality in 
            the private sector stock.&quot;</p>
