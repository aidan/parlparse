            Des McNulty on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body: 
            Holyrood Project</strong>—That the Parliament notes the terms of the Scottish 
            Parliamentary Corporate Body’s (SPCB) report of 13 June 2001; notes 
            that £60 million of the construction costs for the new Parliament 
            building has been committed to date and that a further £57 million 
            (at 1998 prices) remains to be let; further notes that building industry 
            inflation is currently estimated to be adding at least 16% to the 
            costs of packages remaining to be let and that under the construction 
            management contract there are additional and not fully quantifiable 
            risks to which the project may be exposed between now and completion; 
            directs the SPCB, through the Holyrood Progress Group, to work with 
            the design and project teams to complete the project without compromising 
            quality, while managing risks rigorously, and requires the SPCB, on 
            a quarterly basis, to provide information to the Parliament’s Finance 
            Committee on the progress of the project in respect of inflation and 
            materialisation of risk in order to inform the committee’s consideration 
            of the annual Budget Bill. </font></p>

            <strong>Christine Grahame: Borders Education Crisis</strong>—That the Parliament 
            notes the possible closure of small rural schools and reduction in 
            the number of teachers as a result of the expected £3.9 million overspend 
            in the education budget of Scottish Borders Council and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should intervene now and set up an independent 
            inquiry into the actions of the councillors and officials involved.</font></p>

            <strong>Trish Godman: The Scottish Working People's History Society</strong>—That 
            the Parliament commends the members of the Scottish Working People’s 
            History Society for their admirable and determined work in unearthing 
            and cataloguing the documentary and oral archival material relating 
            to the struggles and sacrifices of generations of working women and 
            men to live and participate fully in a tolerable society, but regrets 
            the fact that such fine academic research is being carried out on 
            a shoe-string budget and believes that societies such as this and 
            the Scottish Labour History Society are eminently worthy of more adequate 
            financial support.</font></p>

            <strong>Trish Godman: The Scottish Labour History Society</strong>—That the 
            Parliament congratulates the members of the Scottish Labour History 
            Society for their remarkable and sustained commitment to recording, 
            analysing and publicising the important and influential role of the 
            labour movement in the modern history of Scotland and believes that 
            the achievements, disappointments and stoicism of many anonymous male 
            and female trade unionists and other labour activists might well have 
            remained largely unknown but for this commendable research into, and 
            publication of, our Scottish labour history. </font></p>
