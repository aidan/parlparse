            (#)</strong></P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1351</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Deplorable 
            Treatment of Campbell Martin MSP</strong>-That the Parliament endorses 
            the statement attributed to Campbell Martin MSP that the Scottish 
            National Party leadership was not fit to run Scotland; considers that 
            he was simply stating the obvious, and therefore deplores the decision 
            to suspend him.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1350</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Communication 
            Impairment</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that communication 
            impairment (Cl) affects every aspect of every waking moment of a person's 
            life and that those affected with Cl are not easily able to speak 
            up about their needs; acknowledges that speech and language therapists 
            have a unique understanding of, and provide a vital service to, those 
            affected by Cl, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support quality 
            social action research to explore the experience of people with Cl, 
            seek solutions to improve that experience and the quality of life 
            for people with Cl and work towards providing a comprehensive and 
            coherent framework for action on Cl in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1349</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Fife's 
            Nursery Nurses</strong>-That the Parliament notes the overwhelming 
            rejection by Fife's nursery nurses of the final pay offer by the Labour-led 
            Fife Council and considers that the council should seek agreement 
            from UNISON to take the claim to ACAS with the objective of reaching 
            an agreement as close to the East Dunbartonshire Council settlement 
            as possible, while allowing Fife's nursery nurses to return to work 
            and continue to deliver educational and developmental opportunities 
            to Fife's three and four-year-olds and prepare them for success in 
            school and life.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1347</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Impingement 
            Syndrome</strong>-That the Parliament believes that those who have 
            impingement syndrome of the shoulder relative to an industrial injury 
            should be entitled to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit under 
            the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit scheme; recommends that 
            the syndrome should be added to the list of prescribed diseases; notes 
            that the matter was referred to the research working group of the 
            Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, but considers that this may 
            result in a further delay before the syndrome is recognised and that, 
            in the interim period, those individuals who suffer from this syndrome 
            will continue to lack the benefits to which they would have been entitled 
            had they incurred another form of bursitis to the knee (Beat Knee) 
            or elbow (Beat Elbow), and believes that the lack of inclusion of 
            bursitis of the shoulder in the list of prescribed diseases is anomalous 
            and unfair and, as a result, those workers who are denied benefit 
            are suffering from a manifest injustice.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1346</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Stop the Occupation Appeal Concert</strong>-That the Parliament 
            supports the appeal for the music world to organise a global concert 
            for Palestine; notes that this appeal has been launched by Gazzella, 
            an Italian NGO that helps rehabilitate Palestinian children wounded 
            in Israeli ground and air attacks on Palestinian cities and villages, 
            and believes that a large international music concert would help bring 
            the humanitarian crisis to the attention of young people throughout 
            the world, building on the successes of the Concert for Bangladesh 
            in 1972, Live Aid in 1985, Mandela Freedom at 70 Concert in 1988 and 
            the Freedom for Tibet Concert in 1997.</P>
