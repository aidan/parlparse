<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5646</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Independent Republic of Kelso High School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the declaration of independence from Britain by Kelso High School in the Scottish Borders; endorses the new-found freedoms which independent republican Kelsonian pupils have discovered, and further recognises the right of people in Kelso and the rest of Scotland to independence in order that the voices of our nation are heard directly, reflecting our distinctive interests and contributions to the international community.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5645</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Groupcall Message Alert System for Parents of School Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk Council on being the first local authority in the United Kingdom to introduce the Groupcall alert system in all its schools and urges other local authorities to follow Falkirk&rsquo;s excellent example by introducing such a system which sends a message by text, phone or e-mail to parents if their children do not attend school.</p>
<p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5644</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Orange and Vodafone Working Together</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Orange and Vodafone intend to share their respective mobile phone radio access networks, which include their antennae and phone masts; believes that such a move will mean better service for customers of Orange and Vodafone; notes that the mutual working together of Orange and Vodafone will reduce the number of new phone masts required and&nbsp;allow for&nbsp;the possible removal of existing phone masts where there is unnecessary duplication between Orange&rsquo;s and Vodafone&rsquo;s coverage, and welcomes this joined up way of doing business as it benefits customers and the environment and reduces the pressure on Scotland&rsquo;s landscape to accommodate phone masts.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alex Johnstone<strong>*</strong>, Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5643</strong> <strong>Mr Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>Sale of Weir Pumps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the surprise announcement by Weir Group plc to end over 130 years of world-class engineering by selling its pumps division to Sulzer AG, despite the division&rsquo;s profitability and full order book, with the ultimate loss of 450 jobs but with no consultation with unions, Scottish Enterprise or local parliamentarians; notes that Weir Group plc has now reversed its previous commitment to relocate its pumps division to a new factory in the Glasgow area, thus rejecting assistance from Glasgow City Council and Scottish Enterprise; further notes Weir Group plc&rsquo;s rejection in 2004 of an offer of &pound;2.5 million of Regional Selective Assistance to modernise its Cathcart plant; notes that Scottish Development International and Glasgow City Council have assisted Weir Group plc to access new markets in Russia; further notes that Weir Group plc&rsquo;s secretiveness in this matter meant that other options with the potential to retain jobs, such as Clyde Blowers Ltd&rsquo;s expressed interest in acquiring Weir Pumps, were not properly considered, and believes that Weir Group plc&rsquo;s conduct in this matter falls well short of acceptable standards of corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>, Trish Godman<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5642</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>A Call for True Transparency</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of information on the parliamentary pay and allowances for MSPs as an example of the open and democratic transparency essential in today&rsquo;s modern Parliament; regrets however the way in which these figures are presented as they do not allow for different staffing arrangements such as &quot;pooling&quot;; recognises that this lack of clarity can mislead the public as to the amount of the expenditure incurred by individual MSPs, rather than monies spent on essential staffing costs, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to separate staffing costs from MSPs&rsquo; allowances and thus to present these figures in a truly open and transparent manner that identifies MSPs&rsquo; spending.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5641</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>The Draft Number of Inner House Judges (Variation) Order 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the draft Number of Inner House Judges (Variation) Order 2007 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5640</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Recognition of RMT Strike - Recognition of Workplace Agreements</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 70% vote in favour of strike action by signaller members of the RMT union; considers that the breakdown in industrial relations centres on the failure of Network Rail to honour the spirit and intention of the signallers&rsquo; 35 hour week agreement and that management have abused the rostering agreements and have continued carrying out Cognisco testing in signal boxes, despite a commitment not to do so; recognises that throughout this situation the union and its members have been, and continue to be, available to talk to the management to resolve these issues; believes that RMT members should not be forced to resort to such action and that Network Rail should enter into meaningful negotiations concerning all the many issues at the heart of this dispute and seek to reach agreement with the RMT, and calls on all elected members to exert the strongest pressure on Network Rail to talk to the RMT and to resolve this dispute by honouring the spirit and intention of all workplace agreements with the signallers.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5639</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade Fortnight 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises Fairtrade Fortnight 2007, which will run from 26 February to 11 March 2007; considers that the fair trade movement has already made a huge and positive difference to the lives of many thousands of workers in poorer countries; welcomes the progress made by members of the fair trade movement towards establishing Scotland as a fair trade nation, including organising the Fair Trade Scotland Conference in Perth on 27 January 2007; agrees with delegates at the conference that a fair trade Scotland must be committed to fairer global trade rules and to the fair treatment of Scottish producers, as well as to the Fairtrade standard; congratulates Edinburgh University Students&rsquo; Association (EUSA) and the university itself on their contributions to building fair trade in Scotland; notes that one million cups of Fairtrade coffee alone are drunk in EUSA venues each year; calls on MSPs and the public to support Fairtrade Fortnight and its events, including the University of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Fairtrade Open Day, which is to be held in the university&rsquo;s Appleton Tower on 8 March 2007 from 10 am to 4 pm, and further congratulates Uphall on its award of Fairtrade Town status, joining Edinburgh, Linlithgow and Livingston in the Lothian region in having Fairtrade accreditation.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5638</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Lights Out for Incandescents Down Under</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement by the Australian Government that incandescent light bulbs will not meet mandatory energy efficiency standards after 2010 and notes that this measure will result in a reduction in Australian greenhouse gas emissions of four million tonnes per year by 2015; notes that not only do compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) use roughly one-fifth of the energy of a traditional incandescent bulb for a similar light output but that they also last several times longer, leading to significant cost savings from the use of CFLs; believes that the phasing out of inefficient light bulbs is just one step along a path towards maximum energy efficiency in all sectors within Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do everything in its power to ensure that all energy consumed in Scotland is used as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5637&diams; </strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Changing Places</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that around 3,500 people in Scotland with profound and multiple learning disabilities, as well as many thousands of other disabled people, cannot use standard accessible toilets and require public toilets with enough space for disabled people and their carers along with the right equipment, including a height adjustable changing bench and a hoist; notes the positive examples of facilities in the Meadow Centre in Dumbarton and in the Vale of Leven leisure centre; supports the Changing Places Campaign, launched by the Changing Places Consortium of MENCAP, PAMIS (Promoting a More Inclusive Society), Dumfries and Galloway Council, Nottingham City Council, the Valuing People Support Team and the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Same As You&quot; team, which is calling for more of these toilets to be installed in public places to enable disabled people and their carers to be active citizens, and notes that the Cross Party Group on Learning Disability welcomes all efforts, including those of the Parliament, to ensure that provision is made for people with profound and multiple learning disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5563*#*</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>ME Charities&rsquo; Response to DWP Guidance on ME/CFS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the statement by all the national ME representative organisations in response to version 9 of the Department of Work and Pensions&rsquo; (DWP) guidance document on ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS); further notes the unanimity of the condemnation contained within the response and the disappointment that, following extensive consultation, the DWP has made only minor changes in version 9 of the guidance, despite many of the proposals contained in the draft guidance being unanimously rejected in July 2006 by all the ME organisations involved; further notes that the DWP fails to recognise that ME/CFS is classified by the World Heath Organisation as a neurological disease, and is accepted as such by the Department of Health; finally notes that the guidelines grossly understate the seriousness, chronicity and progressive nature of this organic condition, especially for the severely affected who make up 25% of the ME/CFS population, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its influence to persuade the DWP to revise its final guidelines to ensure that ME/CFS sufferers receive the correct allocation of benefits to which they are entitled and that the views of sufferers&rsquo; representatives in Dumfries and Galloway and across Scotland are fully addressed within those guidelines.</p>
