            Football Club provides an excellent model for those who wish to tackle 
            bigotry and discrimination; acknowledges the immense potential of 
            such an approach; urges Scotland’s football and other sports clubs 
            to consider pursuing similar initiatives, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should consider how it might support the development of 
            this work across Scotland.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1544</strong> <strong>Mr 
            Duncan Hamilton: CalMac Tender Process</strong>—That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the recent disclosure from the maritime industry’s union 
            NUMAST that, despite the assurances of the Scottish Executive to the 
            contrary, the current tender process for Caledonian MacBrayne services 
            was initiated by the Scottish Executive and not the European Commission; 
            further notes the Commission’s view that it was unlikely ever to have 
            become involved had no contact been made by the Executive; condemns 
            the inaction of previous administrations in not applying for a derogation 
            to protect ferry services such as that negotiated by Greece; recognises 
            the potential to reverse this neglect when current guidelines are 
            revised in 2002, and urges the Scottish Executive to work towards 
            a settlement which will secure West Coast ferry services in a single 
            network under public ownership.</font></p>

            conference into the causes and effects of Hepatitis C to be held in 
            Edinburgh on 28 March 2001; notes that upwards of 50,000 Scots may 
            carry the disease, 40,000 of whom are unaware of this, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should consider making 28 March, the day 
            of the conference, a national Hepatitis C awareness day, in order 
            to start the process of properly informing people in Scotland about 
            hepatitis C.</font></p>
