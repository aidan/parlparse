<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4143.1</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>48 Hour Working Time Directive</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4143) in the name of John Wilson, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the UK Government failed to reach an agreement with the European Union with regard to the decision to opt out of the 48 hour working time directive; believes that the defeat of the plans is good news for Scotland&rsquo;s retained fire service and the communities that rely on it; is surprised that SNP members should express such inconsistent views on these proposals, which posed such a grave threat to the service provided by retained firefighters across Scotland; recognises the need for sufficient flexibility in the working time directive to allow retained firefighters to provide vital fire and rescue services in Scotland&rsquo;s most remote areas, and therefore calls on ministers to be vigilant and ensure that they keep up the pressure as the European Commission consults on the way forward.&quot;</p>
