    conclusions of this book deeply offensive to both women and men; strongly believes that
    the theory which forms the basis of this publication, that human males have evolved the
    desire to rape whenever their desire to mate is thwarted, is both dangerous and deeply
    flawed and calls upon the Scottish Executive to take action to ensure that the theory

    have access to bank accounts, and cannot obtain bank accounts; further notes that, in
    rural Scotland, many people do not live near a bank; believes therefore that current
    government proposals to switch payments of benefits directly to bank accounts will be
    detrimental to the Executive&#146;s aim of minimising social exclusion; believes that the
    resulting shift of business from post offices will result in the closure of many post
    offices, especially in areas already suffering from a lack of public services, including
    rural areas and areas of urban deprivation, and therefore calls for recognition of the
    fact that for many, collection of benefits at the post office is the most convenient, or
    indeed the only option and demands that post offices be fully compensated for the loss of
    this work in order to secure the long term economic viability of the existing post office

    announcement that people will be able to continue to receive benefits in cash at post
    offices before, and after, the introduction of the ACT facilities; recognises the valuable
    role played by sub-post offices, particularly in rural areas and in areas of urban

    libraries, school buses and community and voluntary bus services have in such communities;
    further notes the threat to the viability of these services posed by increasing fuel
    prices; believes that assistance should be offered to sustain mobile shops, libraries,
    school buses and community and voluntary bus services and thus the communities they serve,

    fuel duty rebate to these services.</p>

    the publication of an annual report on strategic exports as a first step towards improved

    the Scott Report; notes with concern that without new legislation to address the problems
    identified in the Scott Report and other loopholes, Her Majesty&#146;s Government cannot
    ensure that UK arms exports do not contribute to human rights violations being committed,
    fuel conflict or undermine development; and calls upon Her Majesty&#146;s Government to
    introduce comprehensive and effective legislation to strengthen the control on strategic
    exports in the next Parliamentary session, given that 91% of the Scottish public believe
    that the UK Government should introduce systems to ensure that arms exported by the UK are
    not misused.</p>
