          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2108</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Early Introduction of Consumer Credit Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the inclusion of a consumer credit bill in the Queen&rsquo;s Speech; notes that, whilst debt enforcement is a devolved issue, the regulation of credit is reserved to Westminster; recognises that, in order to tackle the growing problem of debt in Scotland, action is required in both parliaments; notes that the current legislation is 30-years-old and inadequate; welcomes the opportunity for specific Scottish reforms afforded by the bill, and urges the UK Government to ensure that the proposed Consumer Credit Bill is introduced at a sufficiently early date to allow a successful passage through Westminster before dissolution, if this is to occur in 2005.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2107#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Iraq War Reparations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, in the last decade, the Iraqi people have been the victims of the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, have had UN sanctions imposed on them which claimed the lives of half a million people and have paid $18.8 billion to multi-national companies who claimed compensation for Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s 1990 invasion of Kuwait; believes that the rewarding of claims for lost profits to multi-national companies, including $190,000 to Toys R Us, $18 million to Halliburton, $2.3 million to Mobil, $1.6 million to Shell and $505 million to Texaco by the United Nations, while Iraqi children starved, was obscene; further notes that, since the fall of Saddam Hussein, the impoverished people of Iraq have paid out $69.8 million to companies from their US and UK occupiers, while their own infrastructure is crumbling, and considers that these reparation payments should cease immediately.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2106</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Threat to Scottish Magazine and Newspaper Distribution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) review of the newspaper and magazine supply chain in the United Kingdom; recognises that some 14 million newspapers and thousands of individual magazine titles are delivered each day to 54,000 retail outlets, however remote, with the same cover price; notes with concern that the OFT and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry are considering the United Kingdom becoming the first country in the European Union to introduce an entirely free market with no obligation to supply smaller retailers in rural, remote and socially-excluded areas; believes that such a free market would almost certainly put at risk a large proportion of Scotland&rsquo;s 6,000 newspaper and magazine retailers with numerous retailers, especially in the rural areas of Scotland, suffering financial hardship or even closure, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the OFT and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to ensure that the existing tried-and-tested supply chain is retained.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2105</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Palestinian Election</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Marwan Barghouti&rsquo;s decision to stand as a candidate in the Palestinian presidential election.</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2104</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Show Prejudice the Red Card</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that sectarian and racial prejudice is a regular occurrence at football matches and that players, management and supporters&rsquo; clubs have a central role to play in marginalising those elements responsible and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce an annual awards scheme, along the lines of <em>Investors in People</em>, which recognises those clubs that have successfully marginalised such prejudices.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2103</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Celebration of Chanukah</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends warm greetings to Jews throughout Scotland for the Festival of Chanukah; recognises the challenge of dedication represented by the Chanukah lights shining brightly for eight days, dedication to friends, dedication to society and dedication to freedom; further recognises that the Chanukah candles are a powerful symbol of light overcoming darkness, and, with that light, prays for a bright future for the world built on harmony, diversity and freedom.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong>, Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong>, Helen Eadie<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Mike Watson<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2102</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Ballinluig Motor Grill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ballinluig Motor Grill in Perthshire, off the A9, for being named Britain&rsquo;s best transport restaurant in&nbsp;the magazine <em>Commercial Motor</em>; pays tribute to the manager, Clive Bridges, and all the staff for their skills and dedication which have lead to this accolade; notes the valuable contribution made by the Ballinluig Motor Grill to the Perthshire economy with 33 jobs provided, and believes that the restaurant and other such services play a vital role in road safety as they can help prevent driver fatigue.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2101</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>A Climate of Fear</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern regarding the growing climate of fear in the United Kingdom; notes the inflammatory nature of the media report, &quot;Alert after &lsquo;Arabs&rsquo; take photographs of Holyrood&quot;; further notes the detrimental impact that such a climate of fear may have on the Scottish tourist industry, and believes that, while the issue of security is imperative, this must be balanced with respect for civil liberties.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2100#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>World AIDS Day 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the importance of World AIDS Day on 1 December 2004, both for Scotland and for all those nations and peoples most affected by the spread of HIV/AIDS; notes that this year&rsquo;s theme, &quot;Have you heard me today?&quot;, seeks to raise awareness about, and help address, the many issues affecting women and girls around HIV and AIDS; notes the appropriateness of the first female Moderator of the Church of Scotland, Dr Alison Elliot, coming to the Parliament to address the Cross-Party International Development Group and the Cross-Party Group on Sexual Health on &quot;Women, Girls and HIV/AIDS&quot; on 15 December 2004; welcomes the continuing interest of the churches, agencies and other civic society bodies in Scotland which, over the past year, have highlighted the plight of people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, Scotland and elsewhere, and encourages all relevant agencies, the Scottish Executive and MSPs to continue to raise awareness about the disease and work towards its global eradication.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Susan Deacon, Donald Gorrie, Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>S2M-2099</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Co-op Dividend Payout</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the record dividend payout totalling &pound;2.75 million by the Scottish Co-op to its 400,000 Scottish members; welcomes the efforts of the co-operative movement in such initiatives as the promotion of Fairtrade produce and the honest labelling of food with clear nutritional information, and hopes that the Co-op will continue to flourish and show that co-operative and mutually-run enterprises, based upon the principles of democracy, equality, openness and social responsibility, can be financially successful whilst also benefiting the communities in which they operate.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Marlyn Glen, Jackie Baillie, Christine May, Mr Frank McAveety, Robin Harper, Richard Baker, Paul Martin, Mr Mark Ruskell, Brian Adam, Colin Fox, Shiona Baird, Donald Gorrie, Mark Ballard, Rob Gibson, Margaret Jamieson, Dr Elaine Murray, Mrs Mary Mulligan, Elaine Smith, Bristow Muldoon, Ms Sandra White, Mr Alasdair Morrison, Mike Watson<strong>*</strong>, Cathie Craigie<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Tricia Marwick<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Scott Barrie<strong>*</strong>, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Maureen Macmillan<strong>*</strong>, Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>S2M-2098#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Christmas Debt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent survey highlighting the amount of money spent by Scots, and particularly Glaswegians, on Christmas shopping and expresses concern at the potential impact on personal debt which may result from excessive spending over the festive period; acknowledges that people, many of them on low incomes, are under pressure to spend large sums of money and overreach their financial limits to pay for Christmas; considers that those finding themselves in difficulty with personal debt should contact independent, free, experienced debt advice providers such as Citizens Advice Scotland, Law Money Advice Centres or Money Advice Scotland, and strongly believes that debt management companies, often operating under the guise of independent, free, and impartial debt advisors but which in reality levy arrangement fees and charge on a monthly basis for their services, should be avoided.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Christine May, Ms Wendy Alexander, Jackie Baillie, Robin Harper, Christine Grahame, Susan Deacon, Mike Pringle, Shiona Baird, Donald Gorrie, Mark Ballard, Sarah Boyack, Eleanor Scott, Elaine Smith, Bristow Muldoon, Ms Sandra White, Mike Watson<strong>*</strong>, Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Cathie Craigie<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Tricia Marwick<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Scott Barrie<strong>*</strong>, Pauline McNeill<strong>*</strong>, Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong>, Maureen Macmillan<strong>*</strong></p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2092</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Lauder College, Dunfermline - Scottish Employer of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lauder College in Dunfermline on being named Working Families/Lloyds TSB Scotland Scottish Employer of the Year 2004; considers that this important accolade demonstrates that the further education sector contains good and progressive employers who can demonstrate excellence in management and governance, and hopes that other employers in both the public and private sectors will follow the excellent example of Lauder College as an employer.</p>
