          <p><strong>*S1M-2554 Des McNulty on behalf of the Finance Committee: 
            2002-03 Budget Process</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            13th Report, 2001 of the Finance Committee on Stage 2 of the 2002-03 
            Budget Process (SP Paper 468) and notes the recommendations made by 
            the Committee. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2553</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: First Aid 
            in Schools</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to make basic first aid a compulsory part of the school 
            curriculum, as it is in several other European countries; believes 
            that secondary school pupils could be a major new force in life saving 
            and recognises that even two hours training in a lifetime has led 
            to lives being saved; agrees with the ambulance service that lives 
            are being wasted because of a lack of rudimentary first aid in the 
            first few minutes after cardiac arrest; cites the splendid example 
            of a 17 year-old first aider, Scott Gavin of Holyrood RC Secondary 
            School in Glasgow, who rushed to the aid of a maths teacher, Brian 
            Innes, when he collapsed during a lesson and kept him alive until 
            an ambulance arrived, and applauds all voluntary training offered 
            by the Red Cross and youth organisations while believing that a national 
            programme instilling skill and confidence in every secondary pupil 
            in the country is needed and that this could be accomplished with 
            minimal time and expense. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2552</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: House Building in 
            the Bridge of Don Area</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">condemns 
            the undemocratic procedures adopted by Aberdeen City Council Labour 
            group in proposing an additional 700 or more houses in the Bridge 
            of Don area despite a lack of adequate roads and other infrastructure; 
            welcomes the group&#146;s incompetence in failing to persuade all 
            its colleagues to vote for the proposal, and calls on the Scottish 
            Labour Party to investigate the practices of its councillors in Aberdeen.</a></p>
