<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1003&diams; </strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Meeting the Needs of Disabled Children and their Families - &pound;34 Million Could Go a Long Way</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the courage, persistence and commitment of parents with disabled children within the Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout Scotland, in fighting for the rights of their families; notes the findings of the report, <em>Aiming High for Disabled Children: Better Support for Families</em>, drawn from the experience and priorities of families with disabled children across the United Kingdom and which seeks to address the needs of the disabled child and the impact of disability on the rest of the family; welcomes the &pound;34 million funding secured by the dedicated campaigning of families with disabled children and provided to the Scottish Executive to deliver the package of improvements in short breaks, accessible childcare, support for young disabled people in transition to adulthood and help for parents to be involved in shaping local services, and considers that families of disabled children should benefit fully from the &pound;34 million fruits of their campaigning endeavour.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong>, Pauline McNeill<strong>*</strong>, Patricia Ferguson<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, David Whitton<strong>*</strong>, Des McNulty<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1002&diams; </strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>True Cost of PFI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the article entitled &quot;Lifting the Lid on PFI&quot;, published in issue 43 of <em>Scottish Left Review</em>, which concludes that many PFI/PPP projects in Scotland, including projects in the Central Scotland parliamentary region, are being paid for on a one-for-the-price-of-two basis due to the massive returns accruing to the contractors, that local businesses are regularly squeezed out of the tendering process and that there is still not enough transparency in PFI/PPP contracts; believes that much more needs to be done to improve the availability of information and monitoring of the true cost of PFI/PPP projects, and considers that there should be a full-scale inquiry into the reality of PFI/PPP contracts across Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Bashir Ahmad<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1001</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Reinstate our Christmas Carol Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the decision to hold a festive evening rather than a Christmas carol service in the Parliament this year; is concerned that this represents a further retreat from celebrating the traditional Christmas message; considers that, as a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ and a long-established national festival, Christmas should be explicitly celebrated annually in the Parliament, and therefore believes that the festive evening should be scrapped and the traditional Christmas service reinstated.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1000#</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Make Scotland&rsquo;s Roads Safer - Reduce the Drink Driving Limit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the British Medical Association&rsquo;s (BMA) Christmas card campaign calling for a reduction in the drink driving limit; notes that there is clear evidence that shows that drivers who exceed 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood are significantly impaired; further notes with regret that in the Highlands and Islands there are 27% more accidents caused by drunk drivers than the national average; joins the BMA in considering that more pressure should be exerted on the UK Government to lower the drink driving limit from 80mg per 100ml of blood to 50mg; supports the implementation of random testing, which would undoubtedly act as a further deterrent to drink driving, and notes that these measures will make Scotland&rsquo;s roads safer and could save as many as 65 lives a year on UK roads.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-996</strong> <strong>Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Domestic Heating Oil</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the impact of the soaring price of domestic heating oil on Scotland&rsquo;s pensioners and poorer families and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward proposals as to how people and families most affected can be assisted, both financially and by the introduction of further insulation and energy efficiency schemes.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-995</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>UK Failure to Tackle Child Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the Prime Minister&rsquo;s promise to &quot;end child poverty&quot; as incompatible with this year&rsquo;s Comprehensive Spending Review and Pre-Budget Report, which throws a mere 50 pence a week each at the 250,000 children in Scotland living below the poverty line; believes that tackling child poverty, with reference to the Child Tax Credit, will require more than an additional &pound;25 per family per year; calls on Westminster to investigate the capacity of citizens&rsquo; incomes to tackle the issue of rampant child poverty throughout the United Kingdom, and acknowledges that an independent Scotland would not fail to act in the interests of a quarter of a million children living below the poverty line.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-987</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Prepayment Penalties on the Poor</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that customers using prepayment meters to pay for their energy are currently paying an average of &pound;214 per year more than those who have signed up for suppliers&rsquo; online tariffs and &pound;137 more than those paying by direct debit; notes that one in three households have no home access to the internet while one in 11 do not have a bank account; expresses further concern that the number of prepayment meters installed for debt has risen in the last year, effectively barring those customers from switching to a cheaper supplier and payment method; further notes that smart meters have an important role in eradicating the inequalities associated with payment methods, and calls on the Scottish Government to make representations to Ofgem to undertake a comprehensive review of charges for prepayment meter customers as a first step to ensuring that large numbers of Scottish consumers no longer have to pay more for their energy simply because they have no access to a computer or bank account.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-985</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>A Youth Court for Ayrshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the establishment of a youth court in Ayrshire following the success of two pilot youth courts in Hamilton and Airdrie; notes that in Hamilton and Airdrie youth offender recidivism is lower than in comparable sheriff courts, despite dealing with young people with a higher number of convictions; approves of the fast-track form of justice which ensures that young offenders are quickly brought before court, usually within 10 days of the date of the crime being committed, making them more aware of their wrongdoing; welcomes the fact that designated sheriffs, who share in the work of youth courts, provide consistent supervision of each young offender and continue to oversee the young offender&rsquo;s rehabilitation, allowing for sentences to be amended as necessary; recognises that a convicted youth remains accountable to the court for his or her actions or behaviour; acknowledges that this ongoing relationship helps to ensure that young offenders receive the most appropriate treatment and are encouraged to address offending behaviour, and believes that the high level of persistent youth offending in Ayrshire, which has risen substantially in recent years, causing misery and distress for local communities and putting law enforcement agencies under tremendous pressure, makes Ayrshire a priority for establishing a youth court.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-956#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Fifth Annual Scots Trad Music Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hands Up For Trad for organising the fifth annual Scots Trad Music Awards, Comharrachadh Duaisean Dual-che&ograve;l na h-Alba 2007, held in the Nevis Centre, Fort William from 29 November to 1 December 2007; notes the attendance of 900 celebrants and 130 musicians who produced such a spectacular and enjoyable programme drawn from all aspects of our traditional music; congratulates the award winners whose performances have raised the excellence, rude health and growing recognition of Scotland&rsquo;s contemporary indigenous music bringing it to wider public notice each year, which acts as a barometer of a confident and innovative musical culture in today&rsquo;s Scotland but regrets that broadcasters have yet to televise this enjoyable event to take the live performance and celebration of our rich musical traditions onto our television screens, and considers that future awards ceremonies should be televised, starting with the sixth awards due to be held in Glasgow in 2008.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-955#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Music - BBC Scotland Televises Contemporary Traditional Music</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates BBC Scotland for producing the six-part series Scotland&rsquo;s Music, compiled and presented by Phil Cunningham; notes growing public acclaim for the Scotland&rsquo;s Music series as an inspiring exploration of Scotland&rsquo;s musical traditions and heritage as well as acting as a great advert for the hugely varied scenery of our country from the Borders to the Highlands and Islands, and considers that much more urgency should be shown in ensuring that the programme is screened throughout the United Kingdom and on worldwide channels and that the series should be available in CD and DVD formats before Christmas.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-873.2</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Threatened Closure of the King&rsquo;s Theatre in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-873) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out from &quot;following a decision&quot; to end and insert &quot;despite a promise by City of Edinburgh Council Leader, Councillor Jenny Dawe, in May 2007 to give &quot;top priority&quot; to reviving plans for a refurbishment of the King&rsquo;s Theatre; notes the comments of the Chief Executive of the Festival City Theatres Trust which runs the venue on the council&rsquo;s behalf that a delay threatens the King&rsquo;s Theatre with closure on health and safety grounds within two years; recognises the important contribution that the Tollcross venue has made in its 101-year history to the cultural life of Edinburgh, the Lothians and the east of Scotland and which continues today, and calls on the current ruling Lib Dem/SNP council administration to honour the promise made to the people of Edinburgh only a matter of months ago.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>S3M-868#</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Standing United with Glasgow&rsquo;s Pakistani Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is united with members of the Glasgow Pakistani community who protested outside the Pakistan Vice-Consulate&rsquo;s office in Glasgow in November 2007; shares their concerns over the emergency rule imposed by General Musharraf in Pakistan; joins in their calls demanding that the rule of law is adhered to, the judiciary is reinstated and free and fair elections are held as scheduled in January 2008, and considers that representations should be made to Westminster on their behalf and that appropriate pressure be applied to General Musharraf to comply with the democratic wishes of the Pakistani community.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-331#</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Air Ambulance Service in Orkney</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing concerns felt in Orkney about the provision of air ambulance cover in the islands, the validity of which were demonstrated by the recent failure of the Scottish Ambulance Service helicopter to evacuate a patient from Papa Westray because of the weather conditions, with the patient only being evacuated thanks to the co-operation of the pilot of a Loganair BN Islander who was able to use his local experience of the weather to make use of a short weather window to reach the island; further notes that this would not have been possible had the evacuation been needed outside Loganair&rsquo;s operational hours; believes that an independent review of the provision of air ambulance cover in Orkney is urgently needed, and further believes that the outcome of such a review would be the recognition of the need to provide a Kirkwall-based BN Islander air ambulance to provide a back up to the main Scottish Ambulance Service aircraft.</p>
