                        the Parliament warmly welcomes the publication of the 
                        Scottish Executive&#146;s community regeneration statement 
                        Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap; agrees 
                        that despite past successes in community regeneration 
                        more needs to be done to improve the quality of life of 
                        people in Scotland&#146;s deprived areas; fully endorses 
                        the policy proposals for improving public services in 
                        deprived communities, placing community regeneration more 
                        firmly within the strategic framework of community planning, 
                        giving more priority to community learning and development 
                        and improving monitoring and evaluation, and agrees that 
                        these measures will make a significant contribution to 
                        closing the gap between deprived areas and the rest of 
                        Scotland. </p>

                            Closing the Gap; believes that community regeneration 
                            is a topic worthy of serious consideration, and demands 
                            that the Executive go back to the drawing board and 
                            come back when it has some well thought out, workable 
                            solutions to the problems faced by Scotland&#146;s

                            Closing the Gap; agrees that despite past successes

                            deprived areas; notes the Executive&#146;s worthwhile 
                            aim of empowering professionals and communities to 
                            resolve local problems but considers that its bureaucratic, 
                            centralising approach fails to shift the emphasis 
                            of regeneration away from traditional government-imposed 
                            structures; notes that Better Communities in Scotland: 
                            Closing the Gap contains no meaningful proposals to 
                            measure the success or failure of regeneration initiatives, 
                            and calls upon the Executive to implement a genuinely 
                            diverse approach, independent of government, to empower 
                            families, communities, local voluntary organisations 
                            and professionals to take action to resolve the difficulties 
                            faced by Scotland&#146;s deprived communities.&quot;
