    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-794#</b> <strong>Michael Russell: North Ayrshire Unemployment</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with deep concern that in March 2000 North Ayrshire has the worst
    total unemployment rate of any local authority area in Scotland, including the worst
    unemployment rate for women and the second worst unemployment rate for men, deplores the
    huge waste of human potential which this represents in an area where people want to work
    and urges the Scottish Executive to address the grave economic problems which face North
    Ayrshire which include the imminent closure of the Volvo factory.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-793</b> <strong>Rhona Brankin: The Role of Sport in Social Inclusion</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament endorses the Scottish Executive&#146;s vision of achieving equality of
    opportunity for all; supports its aim of making Scotland a more inclusive society where
    inequalities between communities are reduced; recognises the important role which sports
    can play in promoting social inclusion; and commends the work of the Executive, <strong>sport</strong>scotland
    and other agencies to widen participation in sport as part of personal and community
    development.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Mr Sam Galbraith<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-792</b> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Discipline in Schools</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament believes that improved discipline in Scottish schools would contribute greatly
    to improved educational standards and would improve teacher morale; further believes that
    the introduction of targets to reduce the number of pupil exclusions can have a negative
    impact on discipline; recognises that a more flexible approach is required that puts faith
    in the judgement of headteachers to resolve individual cases on their merits, and calls
    upon the Scottish Executive to abandon its agenda of target setting for numbers of school
    exclusions in favour of an approach based on the needs of individual children, their peers
    and teachers backed up by appropriate resources to provide the diversity of educational
    provision and sanctions against bad behaviour that are required to improve discipline.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-791#</b> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Broadcasting of Parliament while in
    Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of the Parliamentary
    Bureau to downgrade broadcasting coverage of the Parliament during the period when the
    Parliament sits in Glasgow; recognises the value of broadcasting coverage in Glasgow as
    there are fewer spaces in the public gallery there; notes that the decision will create a
    significant disruption to the continuous picture archive of the Parliament; further notes
    that the Parliament&#146;s own rules of broadcasting coverage cannot be observed with the
    reduced camera pattern; is concerned that the decision will cause a deterioration in
    coverage of the Parliament during its important and historic Glasgow sittings; concurs
    with the unanimous view of Glasgow City Council that this decision gives an unfortunate
    signal to Glasgow about the way it is considered by the Parliamentary authorities and the
    Executive, and agrees that the Parliamentary Bureau should reverse its decision. </p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-790</b> <strong>David Mundell: Services for Elderly and Disabled People</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that many elderly and disabled citizens across Scotland feel let down
    by the Scottish Executive and its failure to deal with issues which most directly affect
    them; further notes that such citizens are being faced with escalating charges for
    variable social and other services provided by local authorities; believes that many local
    authorities are taking measures which restrict choice for the elderly in their selection
    of nursing or residential care; considers that a lack of local authority resources for
    nursing home places and a lack of co-ordination between health and social work has led to
    a 40% increase in bed blocking in the NHS since 1997; recognises that local authorities
    are systematically withdrawing financial support from facilities used by elderly and
    disabled citizens, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to abandon its agenda of
    political correctness and replace it with a programme that delivers to Scotland&#146;s
    elderly and disabled citizens affordable services, freedom of choice in care and the
    dignity and respect they deserve within our society.</p>

    (CPA) has approved the Parliament&#146;s application to join the CPA; agrees to establish
    a Scottish Parliament branch of the CPA, and further directs the Scottish Parliamentary
    Corporate Body to make arrangements for the establishment of the branch. </p>
