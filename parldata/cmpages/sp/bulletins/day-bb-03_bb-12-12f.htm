            (#)</strong></P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-729</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Reform 
            of Personal Bankruptcy Proceedings</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the Opinion in the case of <em>Advocate General </em>v <em>Maureen 
            Taylor</em>, wherein the obtaining of a warrant to inhibit on the 
            dependence without judicial consideration contravenes Article 1, Protocol 
            1 of the European Convention on Human Rights; recognises that the 
            imposition of such measures to freeze an individual's assets is often 
            unnecessary and can cause hardship and suffering, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to include reform of this practice in its proposed 
            legislation on the reform of personal bankruptcy proceedings.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-728#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>General 
            Medical Services Contracts</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            that the provisions made for contracting-out out-of-hours care from 
            GPs to local NHS boards may be insufficiently funded to meet the unique 
            challenges encountered in rural practices; believes that rural practices 
            thus unable to opt out will have serious difficulty in recruiting 
            new doctors, and considers that the Scottish Executive should re-examine 
            the level of funding allocated to NHS boards providing these services 
            in rural areas.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-727</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Tax 
            Stamps on Spirits</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the Chancellor 
            of the Exchequer has stated that Her Majesty's Government is again 
            considering the introduction of tax stamps on spirits throughout the 
            United Kingdom; recognises that any such tax stamp would impact directly 
            on the Scotch whisky industry; believes that a tax stamp system would 
            be an ineffective means of combating fraud and illicit trade while 
            imposing substantial costs and practical problems on the industry, 
            particularly in relation to labelling and storage, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            against the introduction of tax stamps.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Johnstone<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, 
            Phil Gallie<strong>*</strong>, Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong>, Margaret 
            Mitchell<strong>*</strong>, Mr Ted Brocklebank<strong>*</strong>,

            Alex Fergusson<strong>*</strong>, Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong>, 
            Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-727.1</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Tax 
            Stamps on Spirits</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-727) in 
            the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end 
            and insert &quot;welcomes the announcement by the Chancellor of the 
            Exchequer of the freeze on whisky duty for the remainder of the United 
            Kingdom parliamentary term; recognises the importance of the Scotch 
            whisky industry to the Scottish economy; notes that both the industry 
            and government are united in their desire to combat duty fraud; whilst 
            recognising that tax stamps are not considered to be the most effective 
            option by the industry, understands that Her Majesty's Government 
            is seeking a continued dialogue with the Scotch whisky industry to 
            arrive at a voluntary agreement that is both proportionate and sustainable 
            but, ultimately, which tackles the growing problem of duty fraud, 
            and encourages the Scotch Whisky Association to take the lead in bringing 
            this dialogue to a successful conclusion.&quot;</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-726</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Guantanamo 
            Bay</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 660 suspected terrorists, 
            including nine UK citizens, continue to be detained at the US Naval 
            Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; further notes that these prisoners, 
            who have been detained for almost two years, are being denied access 
            to US courts to test the legality of their continued detention, have 
            no access to civilian lawyers and that their only prospect of trial 
            will be by closed military tribunals in which military personnel will 
            act as interrogators, prosecutors, defence counsel, judges and, in 
            cases where the death penalty is imposed, executioners; welcomes the 
            fact that the US Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether lower 
            courts in the United States of America were right to conclude that 
            US courts lack jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality 
            of the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad in connection 
            with hostilities and incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay; is concerned, 
            however, that, in reaching a decision, the Supreme Court has access 
            to all relevant information including the evidence that many of the 
            individuals held at Guantanamo Bay were not arrested in connection 
            with hostilities; welcomes, in that regard, the involvement of lawyers 
            in the United States of America, England and Scotland in trying to 
            secure basic human rights for those held at Guantanamo Bay, and agrees 
            that this motion may be submitted as part of, and that those signing 
            give support to, a parliamentarians' amicus brief being prepared by 
            lawyers for submission to the US Supreme Court calling for all prisoners 
            to have access to an impartial court to determine their status and 
            test the legality of their continued detention.</P>
