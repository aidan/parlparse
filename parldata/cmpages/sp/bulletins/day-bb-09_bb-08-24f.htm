<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4721</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Nordic Studies Centre Expands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the UHI Millennium Institute&rsquo;s Centre for Nordic Studies in Kirkwall for its expansion to new premises on Kiln Corner and in Scalloway in the North Atlantic Fisheries College; notes its vital role in promoting and preserving all the indigenous cultures of the Highlands and Islands by including Norse, Scots and Gaelic elements in its courses which include the literature of Orkney and more widely the literature of the Highlands and Islands, and welcomes the distance learning ethos of the UHI Millennium Institute that contributes to the international reach of this dynamic centre of learning.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4720</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Glendale Life</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Glendale Trust for mounting a heritage exhibition, displayed in Borrodale school, on the life of Glendale people in the last 200 years; commends the content of the show donated by many whose families and work have enhanced the life of this corner of the Isle of Skye; recalls the important part played by Glendale folk in the crofters&rsquo; struggles of the 1880s and its unique place in the establishment of the people&rsquo;s right to live on their own land, and welcomes the growing support to retain Borrodale school as a heritage centre for the area.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4719</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Equality for All Armed Forces Veterans</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the campaign of the Armed Forces Pension Group to secure equality of pensions for former regular members of the Armed Forces who served for fewer than 22 years at any time to April 1975 and who were discharged before 5 April 1975; further notes that currently former service members who fall into this category receive no service pension at all and that this also applies to those regulars who were discharged prior to 1981 and who do not meet the criteria of length of service and age; believes this current situation to be a form of discrimination against those who have risked their lives in active service, and supports the group&rsquo;s call for the introduction of pension rights based on years of service and related, pro rata, to pensions received by contemporaries who completed 22 years of service.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4718</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Release of Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill MSP, to release Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi on compassionate grounds; notes that Mr al-Megrahi had dropped his appeal and therefore remains a convicted terrorist; notes also that no compassion was extended to the 270 victims of the Pan Am bombing of 21 December 1988 or to the people of the town of Lockerbie who have lived with the aftermath of the bombing for the past 20 years, and believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice badly mishandled the decision making process and that both the process of making the decision and the decision itself have damaged Scotland&rsquo;s international reputation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4716</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>The Need to Protect Attendance Allowance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern proposals contained in the UK Government&rsquo;s Green Paper, <em>Shaping the future of care together</em>, to abolish attendance allowance by integrating it into the care and support system in order to fund future support and care for the elderly in England, and that any changes to the care and support system in England that integrate some disability benefits funding would affect the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland and supports the retention of attendance allowance and disability living allowance as benefits which allow disabled persons to retain financial independence.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4715</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the Cabinet Secretary for Justice and the SNP government for releasing Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi; notes that Mr Megrahi has served only eight years of a life sentence that was passed for his part in murdering 270 people in the 1988 Pan AM disaster; recognises that Alex Salmond&rsquo;s government has mishandled this whole affair and has alienated friends and allies of Scotland; further recognises that the SNP government has done a disservice to the relatives of the victims of the Lockerbie atrocity, and offers its deepest sympathy to the families of the victims at this difficult time.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4714</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Lockerbie, In the Name of Justice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that, with (a) so many unanswered questions relating to the prosecution and conviction of Abdelbaset al Megrahi, (b) the abandonment of his appeal with the evidence upon which the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission concluded that there may have been a miscarriage of justice on the basis of unheard evidence, (c) inter alia new evidence indicating that Mr Megrahi was not in Malta when a crucial purchase of items linking him directly to the explosion took place, (d) information that four days before he was picked out at an identity parade by Tony Gauci, the shop keeper who is said to have sold those items, the same Gauci had seen a photograph of Mr Megrahi in an article linking him to the bombing, (e) evidence not made available to the defence and (f) further new evidence, in the name of justice for the victims, their relatives and Mr Megrahi, a public inquiry with the full participation of United Kingdom and United States authorities is essential.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4689.1</strong> <strong>James Kelly:</strong> <strong>The Arc of Recovery</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4689) in the name of Linda Fabiani, leave out from &quot;is being&quot; to end and insert &quot;has benefited from action taken by the UK Government to avoid the worst effects of the global economic downturn through a fiscal stimulus package including an increase in tax allowances equivalent to &pound;145 less tax over this year, a 2.5% cut in VAT equivalent to a 1% cut in interest rates, accelerated increases in child benefit to &pound;20 per week and child tax credits by 25% above inflation, a one-off payment to support pensioners during the downturn in addition to the annual Winter Fuel Allowance and an increase in Pensions Credits to &pound;130 per week for single pensioners, UK-wide action to avoid home and business repossessions as well as action to avoid the potentially catastrophic consequences of a banking collapse including avoiding potential liquidation of the Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and the Dunfermline Building Society; notes that, while the global economic downturn has been painful in Scotland and the UK as a whole, the effects have been considerably less severe than the experiences in Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, two of the three &quot;arc of prosperity&quot; counties cited as appropriate economic comparators for an independent Scotland in the SNP&rsquo;s <em>Manifesto 2007</em>, in which the global economic downturn has resulted in not just economic recession but official depression, defined as economic contraction of at least 10%; further notes in this regard that that <em>OECD 2009 Economic Outlook </em>cites the collapse of Iceland&rsquo;s three main banks, the required bail-out by the International Monetary Fund followed by official interest rates of 18%, as well as, what it terms &quot;substantial spending cuts and increases in taxation&quot; in the Republic of Ireland, which has been forced to commission a public cuts study by &quot;An Bord Snip Nua&quot; proposing &euro;5.3 billion of cuts including 17,300 public service job cuts, a 5% drop in social welfare and closure of police stations among other examples, and believes that, although the so-called &quot;arc of prosperity&quot; was always a deeply-flawed, simplistic and contradictory economic prescription for Scotland, having cited the Republic of Ireland and Iceland as appropriate models prior to the downturn, the SNP cannot now credibly claim that a separate Scotland would have escaped a similar economic fate as those countries that have been hit far worse than Scotland within the United Kingdom and that the SNP&rsquo;s selective memory of the global downturn serves to underline not just its economic ineptitude but also its insincerity with the people of Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4671.1</strong> <strong>James Kelly:</strong> <strong>Surviving the Recession, A Lesson from Scandinavia</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4671) in the name of Aileen Campbell, leave out from second &quot;notes&quot; and insert &quot;therefore believes that this questions even further the First Minister&rsquo;s economic judgment given his call in April 2007 for &quot;light touch regulation&quot; of banks in comparison to what he termed the UK&rsquo;s &quot;gold plated&quot; system; further believes that the First Minister&rsquo;s economic credibility was already in question following his advocacy of the Republic of Ireland and Iceland as suitable economic models for Scotland, despite the fact that the global economic downturn has resulted not just in a recession in each of those countries, but an official economic depression, and further believes that any claim by the SNP that Norway was the exclusive economic model for an independent Scotland advocated by it prior to the economic downturn would damage the party&rsquo;s credibility even further.&quot;</p>
