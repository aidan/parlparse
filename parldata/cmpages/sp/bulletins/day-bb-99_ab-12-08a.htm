              negotiations from Her Majesty&#146;s Government to the Scottish Executive, in recognition

              the Scottish industry that does not place it at a competitive disadvantage in comparison
              to other EU fleets, and influence the forthcoming reform of the Common Fisheries Policy by
              bringing forward proposals to introduce the concept of zonal management thereby involving
              the industry itself in the decision-making process, whilst maintaining the founding
              principles of the original agreement, namely relative stability, the Hague preferences and
              historic fishing rights, to re-affirm that the Common Fisheries Policy is not a

              failing our fishermen and calls upon the Scottish Executive to advocate reform of the CFP

              control over the stocks of fish whilst recognising the traditional rights of other
              countries, and further calls for the fishing section of MAFF to be relocated to the North
              East of Scotland, the UK&#146;s main fishing centre, and that continuous assessment should
              replace the current practice of annual negotiation. </p>
