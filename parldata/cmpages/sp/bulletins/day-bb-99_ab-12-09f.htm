    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-371</b> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil: Flooding in Inverclyde</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes that the recent flooding in Inverclyde dealt a blow to the area;
    recognises that this is a long-term, recurring problem; notes that, were it to persist, it
    may adversely affect investment in the area, and agrees that a multi-agency approach
    offers the best opportunity to facilitate a permanent solution.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-370</b> <strong>Brian Adam: Intergrated Detoxification and Rehabilitation
    Centre in North East</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the Aberdeen Independent
    campaign for an integrated detoxification and rehabilitation centre to tackle the North
    East&#146;s drug crisis.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Irene McGugan<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, Shona
    Robison<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-369</b> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:
    Scotland Act 1998</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that The Scotland Act 1998 (Transfer
    of Functions to the Scottish Ministers etc.) (No.2) Order 1999 be approved.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-368</b> <strong>Euan Robson: Scottish Heart at Risk Testing</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament commends the work of Scottish Heart at Risk Testing (the Cameron Gunn
    Memorial Fund), the only recognised Scottish charity dedicated to fighting cardiomyopathy
    in all its forms and raising public awareness of the disease; supports its efforts to set
    up a national screening programme using echocardiograms and ultra-sound scanners which
    will provide information to local health boards and cardiology departments, and calls upon
    the Scottish Executive to support the work of the charity. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-367</b> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Jobs Crisis in the Highlands and Islands</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament expresses grave concern at the loss of over 3000 jobs at the Barmac yards
    in Ardersier and Nigg and at the threat to a further 400 jobs at the Lewis Offshore
    fabrication yard at Stornaway, and notes that this job crisis may according to Highlands
    and Islands Enterprise cost the economy of the Highlands and Islands £74 million per
    annum; welcomes assurance given by the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning to a
    meeting of Highlands and Islands MSPs on 1 December 1999 that all necessary resources will
    be made available to Highlands and Islands Enterprise and to local councils to combat this
    crisis; believes that the estimated £20 billion revenue to the London Exchequer from oil
    and gas over the next five years is in substantial part attributable to the skills of a
    dedicated workforce at such yards and that they and their communities deserve a
    re-investment to secure the Highlands and Islands economy; demands that the Scottish
    Executive and the Scottish Parliament review the taxation system which has caused
    uncertainty for present and future investment; notes the importance of the Highlands and
    Islands Convention as a genuine forum to reach positive recommendations and calls for its
    immediate re-establishment, and believes that the Highlands and Islands requires nothing
    less than a comprehensive jobs regeneration plan.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-366#</b> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Equality of Opportunity for People with
    Hearing Impairment</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is committed to ensuring that deaf and
    hearing impaired people have equal access to leisure and social activities, public
    services, employment and educational opportunities and resolves to promote this by
    encouraging the provision of deaf awareness classes in workplaces and in the Scottish
    educational system and by supporting the provision of sign language and lip reading
    classes, with qualified tutors and at no charge to hearing-impaired users, in each
    locality.</p>
