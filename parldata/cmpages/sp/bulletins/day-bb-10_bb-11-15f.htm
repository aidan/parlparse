<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7403 Dave Thompson: Congratulations to Rag Tag &lsquo;n&rsquo; Textile</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Rag Tag &lsquo;n&rsquo; Textile on winning the 2010-11 Scottish Business Diversity Awards in the Social Firm Category at a ceremony held in the Caledonian Hotel, Edinburgh; supports the company&rsquo;s aims of helping people with mental health problems through the use of traditional arts and crafts methods with a modern twist; further acknowledges that the company up-cycles unwanted locally donated textiles and uses these fabrics to produce unique handcrafted items for sale; notes that the company contributes to the local economy of Skye and Wester Ross by employing people who are recovering from mental health problems and who might otherwise be distanced from their local community; considers that the company is reducing the stigma faced by some people with mental health issues; applauds the hard work and dedication of Cindie Reiter and her staff in Kyle of Lochalsh and Broadford on the Isle of Skye, and congratulates everyone at Rag Tag &lsquo;n&rsquo; Textile for what it considers to be their superb contribution to their local communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7402 Bill Kidd: Universal Credit and an Uncertain Future for Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the position of carers that has arisen from the proposals in the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper <em>Universal Credit: welfare that works</em>; considers that the paper&rsquo;s statement that &quot;All governments, since 1976, when Invalid Care Allowance was introduced, have faced the dilemma that increasing the level of benefit is neither affordable nor cost effective&quot; appears to seriously undervalue the contribution that carers make to society, including the huge savings it believes that they make to public finances by providing informal, unpaid care; is concerned about what it considers is the confusing uncertainty surrounding the future of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance arising from the words &quot;The Government is carefully considering whether changes to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be necessary to take account of the introduction of Universal Credit and provide clearer more effective support for carers&quot;, and is further concerned that the paper states that recipients of Universal Credit will not be required to face conditionality if they have &quot;intensive and regular caring responsibilities&quot;, believing that this indicates a possible tightening of the future definition of who is or is not a carer.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7401 Margaret Mitchell: Circle Lanarkshire&rsquo;s Addiewell Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Circle Lanarkshire on its HMP Addiewell Project, which supports offenders through their transition from prison back into the community, working to reduce the possibility of reoffending and to strengthen the relationships between offenders and their families, in particular their children; acknowledges that the project helps offenders access other services such as counselling, drug agencies, employment and education; considers that Circle Lanarkshire&rsquo;s workers provide extensive and flexible support both inside prison and in the community and commends them on their efforts; notes the contribution of the Robertson Trust and Kalyx to the project, which has now completed its first year, and hopes that the project will continue to help those offenders in HMP Addiewell and inspire the development of other throughcare projects.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7400 Nicola Sturgeon: Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Shona Robison<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7399 Adam Ingram: Children&rsquo;s Hearings (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Children&rsquo;s Hearings (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
