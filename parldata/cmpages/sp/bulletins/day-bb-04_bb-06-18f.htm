          <p><strong>*S2M-1497</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> 
            <strong>Scottish Football Museum</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the complaint lodged with the office of the Scottish 
            Charities Regulator by Mr Ged O'Brien, former Director of the Scottish 
            Football Museum; considers the allegations regarding the relationships 
            between the Scottish Football Association, Hampden Park Ltd and the 
            Scottish Football Museum to be very serious indeed, and believes that 
            they must be fully investigated to ensure that the museum has been 
            administered with the degree of probity that the Parliament expects, 
            given the extensive use of public money in the venture.</P>

            of Shetland Against Deportation, which is campaigning to ensure that 
            the Burmese family of Hazel Minn and her two children are not deported 
            by order of the Home Office from her home in Shetland to where she 
            would be in severe danger and in opposition to the wishes of around 
            6,000 Shetlanders who have signed a petition in support of the Minn 
            family.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1495</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Governance (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that

            in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;but, in so doing, 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should bring forward legislation, 
            as a matter of urgency, to decouple elections to Scottish local authorities 
            from the elections to the Parliament.&quot;</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1494</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Taste 
            of Grampian - 12 June 2004</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            success of the annual Taste of Grampian event which took place on 
            12 June 2004 at Thainstone in Aberdeenshire; further notes the importance 
            of this event to promoting food from all sectors of the industry to 
            the general public; believes that the food industry in the north east 
            of Scotland is vital to many rural economies and that such an event 
            helps to showcase Grampian's, and Scotland's, reputation as a world 
            class food producer, and congratulates the organisers on a highly 
            successful event and wishes them every success with next year's Taste 
            of Grampian event.</P>
