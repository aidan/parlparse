<STRONG>Johann Lamont: Regulation of Private Security Firms</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with concern the lack of regulation of private security firms 
and the potential impact of unscrupulous activity by these firms on the safety 
and peace of mind of local communities within Glasgow Pollok constituency, across 
Glasgow and throughout Scotland; further notes the serious danger posed by any 
activity that undermines the confidence of the public in the police's capacity 
to deal with criminal behaviour within communities, and considers that the Scottish 
Executive, along with local authorities, the police and other relevant agencies, 
should develop as a matter of urgency means by which private security firms can 
be regulated and their activities scrutinised.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3521</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Angus MacKay: Condemnation of the Attack on the Edinburgh Synagogue</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament condemns the attack on the Edinburgh Synagogue on Salisbury Road, 
South Edinburgh, on 24 October 2002; expresses its disgust at all manifestations 
of anti-Semitism and other intolerance; notes that, whilst the perpetrators as 
yet remain anonymous, Scotland, like the rest of the UK, has seen a rise in anti-Semitism 
and religious intolerance in the past months and that some extremist political 
groups and individuals have used the tragic situation in the Middle East as justification 
for attacks, verbal and physical, on Scotland&#146;s Jewish and other communities, 
and asserts that the odious creed of anti-Semitism and intolerance runs counter 
to the principles of tolerance, pluralism and respect for all people which are 
the central tenets of a devolved Scotland.</P><P>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3520#</STRONG> <STRONG>Janis Hughes: National Carers Rights Day</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes that 3 December 2002 is National Carers Rights Day; recognises 
the crucial role of carers of all ages in supporting the most vulnerable people 
in society; welcomes the support provided to carers through the Community Care 
and Health (Scotland) Act 2002, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
continue to support the work of the carers throughout the country.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3518#

an amendment to motion (S1M-3511) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from 
&quot;and believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets that this latest crisis 
comes on the back of the announcement that Scotland is to receive only 2% of the 
total allowable catch for deep water species on the west coast of Scotland, and 
believes that we need to restore national and local control and management of 
our waters to ensure sensible conservation measures and to protect the interests 
of Scotland&#146;s fishermen.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3511.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Ross 
Finnie: Fishing</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3511) in the name 
of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;rejects 
the wholesale closure of Scottish fishing grounds as politically unacceptable 
and economically ruinous for Scotland&#146;s fishing communities; welcomes the 
fact that the Scottish Executive is working in close collaboration with the Scottish 
fishing industry to identify alternative approaches, and urges all concerned to 
pursue a longer-term strategy that will reverse the historic decline in key fish 
stocks and secure a sustainable basis for our fisheries-dependent communities.&quot;

expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;; recognises the importance to Scotland 
of UK, Scottish and regional television programming and production; believes that 
these interests are enhanced by diversity in media ownership, and believes that

to end and insert &quot;; believes that the public interest is best protected 
by maximising competition and liberalising the current strict laws that apply 
to the media; supports the principle that such matters are dealt with at a UK 
level but considers that the current regulatory structure is detrimental to the 
growth and prosperity of the sector, and supports the right of broadcasters and 
publishers to make their own commercial decisions with the minimum possible interference 
from the state.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3506 Hairmyres Hospital Ancillary Staff</STRONG>
