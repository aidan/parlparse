<!-- #BeginEditable "Body%20text" --><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Meeting of the 
Parliament</STRONG></P><DIR> <P>9.30 am&#9;Debate on Performance of the Scottish 
Economy&#151; </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3376</STRONG> <STRONG>Andrew Wilson:</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Performance of the Scottish Economy</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes with great concern the latest government figures on economic growth showing 
Scotland has entered official recession for the first time in twenty years; recognises 
that this recession is the latest symptom of economic under-performance in Scotland 
over a protracted period and that Scotland has the potential to perform much better 
than it has; resolves that the performance of the Scottish economy should be of 
prime importance to the agenda of the Executive, the Parliament and all concerned 
with the well-being of the people of Scotland and the sustainable financing of 
public service investments, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
set an ambitious target for improving Scotland&#146;s trend rate of growth and 
contribute to a mature, serious and open-minded debate about the best policy measures 
to achieve that target, keeping an open mind about both the limits of existing 
powers and the potential competitive benefits of properly focussed policies with 
the full powers of independence. </P> <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the 
following amendments</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3376.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Iain Gray: Performance 
of the Scottish Economy</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3376) in 
the name of Andrew Wilson, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert 
&quot;endorses the Scottish Executive&#146;s aim to increase the sustainable growth 
of the Scottish economy over the long term, using the powers available to the 
Parliament, thus providing resources for first-class public services and a more 
socially just and sustainable Scotland; supports the work undertaken to improve 
the long-term performance of the Scottish economy as set out in the Framework 
for Economic Development and Smart, Successful Scotland, and notes the progress 
in implementing measures to help businesses grow, build Scotland&#146;s global 
connections and improve Scotland&#146;s skills base.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3376.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Miss Annabel Goldie: Performance of the Scottish Economy</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3376) in the name of Andrew Wilson, leave out from 
&quot;this recession&quot; to end and insert &quot;economic growth is the key 
to raising personal living standards, providing opportunity and security for all 
and the means by which we improve our public services and quality of life; further 
recognises that this prosperity can only be created on a sound entrepreneurial 
base, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to increase investment in 
our transport infrastructure and to return Scotland to a uniform business rate 
poundage throughout the United Kingdom, these being two essential factors in providing 
the right framework for the creation of wealth and jobs.&quot; </P><P><em>followed 
by</em> &#9;Debate on Acute Services Review&#151; </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3375</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Nicola Sturgeon:</STRONG> <STRONG>Acute Services Review</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the proposed £700 million investment in the modernisation 
of Glasgow&#146;s hospitals; considers, however, that the plan by Greater Glasgow 
NHS Board for the re-structuring of acute services in Glasgow is unacceptable 
in its current form; is particularly concerned about the proposed number and location 
of in-patient hospitals and the reduction of accident and emergency departments 
from five to two, and calls upon the Minister for Health and Community Care to 
suspend his approval of the board&#146;s plan and to establish an independent 
expert group to conduct, within six months, an impartial review of the plan, with 
a view to identifying proposals which command greater public acceptance and which 
can be implemented within a rapid timeframe. </P><P>The Presiding Officer has 
selected the following amendment</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3375.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Malcolm 
Chisholm: Acute Services Review</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3375) 
in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;considers&quot; to end and 
insert &quot;accepts that the status quo is not an option and that improvements 
and modernisation must be progressed as soon as possible in order to enhance the 
quality of care; recognises that this is a long-term plan which must be flexible 
enough to take account of changing service demands and developing medical practice; 
supports an on-going monitoring and review process that includes external independent 
audit by Audit Scotland on an annual basis; endorses a commitment to keep named 
services at Stobhill and Victoria over the next five years and to have this locally 
monitored; gives high priority to the acceleration of ambulatory care and diagnostics 
developments in consultation with local communities; recognises the particular 
concern over the number of accident and emergency departments and supports a review 
of this in two years time that involves staff, patient and community groups, Glasgow 
Health Council and the Scottish Royal Colleges, and welcomes current developments 
in the Scottish Ambulance Service which will include the near doubling of paramedics 
in Glasgow by 2005 and one paramedic in the crew of each front-line ambulance.&quot;

<STRONG>Cathie Craigie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Causing Death by Dangerous Driving</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the publication of the report by the Transport Research Laboratory, 
Road Safety Research Report No.26, Dangerous Driving and the Law, which examines 
the use and application of the law on careless and dangerous driving throughout 
the UK; supports the report where it states that in Scotland a "clearer message 
regarding the seriousness of these offences would be sent to both defendant and 
society if all causing death by dangerous driving cases were tried in the High 
Court" rather than sheriff courts, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
(a) commission specific Scottish research in this area to take on board the report&#146;s 
conclusions and recommendations and (b) take the necessary steps to ensure that 
dangerous driving offences are heard in the appropriate court and not downgraded.
