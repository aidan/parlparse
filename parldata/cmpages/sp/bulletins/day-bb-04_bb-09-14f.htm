          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1681</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Corporate Responsibility</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the significant impact that businesses and corporations can have on communities and the environment in which they operate and supports efforts aimed at improving the accountability of companies for their actions.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1680</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>&quot;Beachwatch&quot; Survey and Beach Clean Weekend on 18 and 19 September 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes and supports the Marine Conservation Society&rsquo;s annual &quot;Beachwatch&quot; survey and beach clean-up scheduled for 18 and 19 September 2004; notes that it contributes to the International Coastal Clean-up taking place in over 90 countries coinciding with the United Nations Environment Programme&rsquo;s &quot;Clean Up the World&quot; Weekend and commends the fact that over 40 community groups have registered to participate; notes that this annual voluntary operation continues to constitute the single most comprehensive snapshot of the degree of littering on Scotland&rsquo;s beaches; further notes with concern that the 2003 survey results showed a 29% increase in the number of litter items recorded per kilometre surveyed compared with 2002 or 99% since 1994 and, while commending the Marine Conservation Society&rsquo;s proven example of working successfully in partnership with Firth Forums and other groups, notes that the Scottish Coastal Strategy recognises that there are important benefits to be gained by co-ordinated working through adoption of a marine litter strategy for Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to take a firm lead following its recognition of beaches as a national resource and its commitment to consult on the best strategy for protecting and enhancing all of Scotland&rsquo;s coastline.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1679</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Andrew Murray, Winner of US Boys&rsquo; Open Tennis Championship</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Andrew Murray for winning the United States Boys&rsquo; Open Tennis Championship and calls on the Scottish Executive and <strong>sport</strong>scotland to ensure that he, and other promising young tennis players and sportspeople, receive all the support possible and that the successes of Andrew Murray and other Scots are used to encourage more young people to fulfil their potential in sport.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1678</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Threat from Large Casinos</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the implications of the proposed new regime for casino and gambling regulation contained in the UK Gambling Bill and the worrying potential for an increase in gambling addiction; believes that large new casinos neither add long-term value to, nor create sustained economic benefit and lasting additional job opportunities for, local communities; notes the number of potential new casinos being proposed in the Glasgow area in particular; believes that large-scale casinos are not a good use of scarce urban land; does not wish to see Glasgow become the &quot;Las Vegas&quot; of Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive and local authorities to put in place strict planning and licensing regimes that will discourage such developments.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1677</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Concessions for Elderly Passengers of Scottish Citylink</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the additional concession by Scottish Citylink to allow concessionary passengers to travel across boundaries on all of their services; further congratulates Scottish Citylink on the introduction of lower fares for passengers aged 60 and over on its Glasgow to Edinburgh route; acknowledges that these concessions go beyond the current local concessionary travel scheme for the elderly; notes that the limitations of the local scheme impact negatively on the social exclusion of elderly people; agrees that this must only be a short-term solution, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement its policy in the Partnership Agreement by properly financing and delivering a national concessionary travel scheme for elderly and disabled people forthwith.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1676#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Student Loans Payment Date</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the student loan is currently paid in three instalments through the academic year, designed to correspond to three academic terms; further notes that the majority of students in Scotland attend higher education institutions that have a semester system; believes that the payment of student loan instalments in Scotland should correspond to the academic year followed by the majority of students in Scotland; believes that making a third of the student loan unavailable until a few weeks before the end of the academic year is likely to result in unnecessary student hardship, higher drop-out rates and increased administration costs for higher education institutions distributing welfare payments, and considers that the Student Loans Company, the Department for Education and Skills and the Student Awards Agency for Scotland should co-operate with student organisations and higher education institutions to arrange for student loans to be paid to all students studying in Scotland monthly or at intervals appropriate to the pattern of the academic year predominant in Scotland.</p>
