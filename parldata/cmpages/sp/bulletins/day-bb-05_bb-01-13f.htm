         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2249</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Scottish Environment Week in the Parliament, 7 to 13 February 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming Scottish Environment Week in Holyrood from 7 to 13 February 2005 which will focus on the importance of the environment and its value to the society and economy of Scotland; welcomes the opportunity to celebrate our rich and diverse natural and cultural heritage, to acknowledge the active involvement of people across the country in caring for the environment in their own communities and workplaces and to showcase sustainable development successes in practice, and looks forward to the exhibition and events throughout that week which will bring people together to look towards challenges and opportunities in securing the well-being of our environment and our future.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2248</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Scottish Rugby</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with extreme concern the current situation within Scottish Rugby which has seen the resignation of a number of senior figures within the organisation, including David Mackay as Chairman of the Executive Board and Phil Anderton as Chief Executive, following a no confidence vote in the Chairman by the SRU General Committee; recognises the importance of rugby at both a local and national level as one of Scotland&rsquo;s major sports; applauds the efforts which had been made by the former Chairman and Chief Executive to take forward a strategy which would secure a sustainable future for rugby in Scotland; believes that it is vital that effective leadership and direction is restored within Scottish Rugby at the earliest possible date, and supports calls for the reinstatement of David Mackay as Chairman of the Executive Board and Phil Anderton as Chief Executive to secure this objective.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2247#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Scotland Leads the Way in Revolutionary New Skin Cancer Treatment, Highlighting Partnership Between Dunfermline, St Andrews and Dundee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the fact that Scotland is leading the way in developing a revolutionary new skin cancer treatment; notes the significance of this development as skin cancer has become so prevalent throughout the world that full statistics are generally no longer collected for its most common form, non-malignant melanoma; acknowledges conservative estimates that around 10% of Scotland&rsquo;s population, or half a million people, will suffer from the disease at some point in their lifetime and that the percentages of the population at risk in countries with sunnier climates, such as the United States of America and Australia, are very much higher; regrets that non-melanoma skin cancer is often excluded from comparative analyses of cancer data due to a perception by medical professionals that cancers of this kind are rarely life-threatening; welcomes, however, the news that most non-melanoma skin cancers are detected early and can be treated on an out-patient basis; understands that the relationship between sunlight and skin cancer is well known, but also welcomes the news that cause can become treatment; congratulates, therefore, Professor Samuel of the Organic Semiconductor Centre at the University of St Andrews and Dermatology Consultant and Professor James Ferguson, Head of the Photobiology Unit at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, who have come up with a novel way of treating melanomas using a treatment called &quot;photodynamic therapy&quot; with the use of &quot;light bandages&quot;, a concept which has never been tried anywhere else in the world and which works by using a dressing containing its own light source; notes that patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are able to move around freely, ensuring that it is less painful than existing treatment methods because a less intense light is required and that using the bandage is also often more effective as it can be used over a longer period of time; further notes that Professor Samuel and Professor Ferguson are ready to take the next step towards making it available to the world, and commends Mr Alf Stewart, a Dunfermline businessman, for his generous financial support of the photodynamic treatment for cancer through the Barbara Stewart Cancer Trust in memory of his late wife, Barbara, a victim of skin cancer.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2246</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the bad weather currently experienced by Scotland; agrees that the impact of this weather is a direct result of a lack of commitment on the part of successive Westminster and Holyrood governments to address the issue of climate change; calls on the Scottish Executive, in light of the current flooding and the upcoming G8 summit being hosted by Scotland, to initiate an immediate cessation of all non-essential road building projects in Scotland such as the M74 extension, an immediate cessation of all building on floodplains, an immediate cessation of draining of wetlands including proper river basin management and an immediate nationwide project of native broadleaf tree planting.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2245</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Pay-outs from Skipton Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of pay-outs of &pound;20,000 to 400 people infected by hepatitis C through transfusion of infected blood products; notes that it was pressure from the Parliament which forced the UK Government to act, and further notes that, without devolution, these &pound;8 million payments would not be happening.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2243</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of building safe and secure communities and agrees that the provisions of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill that relate to devolved matters and those that relate to the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2242</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Inquiries Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the benefits of a modern statutory framework for the holding of inquiries into matters of public concern and agrees that the provisions in the Inquiries Bill, so far as they relate to matters within the legislative competence of the Parliament or to the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2241.2</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Victims and Witnesses</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2241) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end &quot;; further notes that, whilst it is a citizen&rsquo;s duty to report crime and testify, in doing so significant difficulties and dangers can be encountered by many; calls for additional assistance to be given towards rehousing and protection including a specific Scottish Witness Protection Programme, and further recognises the serious psychological effect that being a witness or victim of crime often involves and so calls for any future reform in this area to include adequate provision for treatment of trauma.&quot;</p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2240.3</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Make Poverty History</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2240) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;calls for a summit&quot; to end and insert &quot;; therefore welcomes the recent meeting between the Scottish Executive, aid agencies and other interested parties; recognises that more than 200,000 people die of preventable causes every week and that more assistance by the richer countries is needed to tackle global poverty; notes that the Make Poverty History campaign is a timely reminder that the richer countries must take more effective action on debt repayments, trade agreements and aid, which are inextricably linked; demands that, if the poorest countries are to be lifted out of abject poverty, the G8 and the European Union (EU) must require governments of countries in receipt of economic and structural aid to do all in their power to ensure its fair and equitable distribution, and reminds the G8 and EU of their responsibility to ensure that their policies are not ultimately rendered ineffective by the actions of national and international organisations which have prospered under the current unfair international trade, debt and aid conditions.&quot;</p>
