<p align="center"><strong>Section E &ndash; Written questions lodged on 5 October 2009</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information to the Parliament.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>S3W-27987</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made in preparing the second stage strategy for the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development Education, taking the first action plan for the first half of the decade to the end of the decade in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27988</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what stakeholder consultation it has undertaken in the school, community and tertiary education sectors in preparing the second stage strategy for the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development Education and what form this consultation has taken.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27989</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-27050 by Nicola Sturgeon on 15 September 2009 showing that alcohol-related deaths rates in the Western Isles, Moray and Edinburgh Central were 208, 195 and 226% of the UK average respectively, what assessment it has made of the impact that minimum pricing will have on alcohol-related death among the affluent population, given that according to the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation only six of the 1,301 20% most deprived data zones are in these constituencies.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27990</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, given that, of the 17 constituencies with a share of Scotland&rsquo;s 20% most deprived data zones totalling 0.5% or less, 13 have alcohol-related death rates above the UK average, what assessment it has made of the impact that minimum pricing will have on alcohol-related deaths among the affluent population. </p>
<p><strong>S3W-27991</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, given that the <em>Scottish Health Survey 2008</em> shows that weekly alcohol consumption for women is highest among those in managerial and professional households, in the highest income quintile and among those living in the least deprived areas, what assessment it has made of the impact that minimum pricing will have on alcohol-related deaths.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27992</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive for what reason consumption data from the<em> Scottish Health Survey 2003</em>, rather than the recently published 2008 survey, was used in the University of Sheffield appraisal of alcohol minimum pricing and off-trade discount bans in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27993</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to the impact that the most recent consumption figures, showing that the proportion of men and women drinking over the weekly recommended limit has declined since 2003, would have on the minimum pricing modelling used in the University of Sheffield appraisal of alcohol minimum pricing and off-trade discount bans in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27994</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, following publication of the <em>Scottish Health Survey 2008</em>, showing that between 2003 and 2008 the proportion of men and women drinking over the weekly recommended limit declined from 34 to 30% and 23 to 20% respectively, whether it considers that the use of these data in the University of Sheffield appraisal would have impacted on its results.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27995</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether there are plans to alter the distribution of funding for the Youth Music Initiative from the Scottish Arts Council to local authorities and, if so, what conditions will be attached in single outcome agreements to the use of these funds by local authorities.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27996</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions Scottish ministers have had since May 2007 with HM Treasury ministers about funds in Ofgem&rsquo;s Fossil Fuel Levy account.</p>

<p><strong>S3W-27999</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what correspondence its officials have had since May 2007 with HM Treasury officials about funds in Ofgem&rsquo;s Fossil Fuel Levy account.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28000</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions Scottish ministers have had since May 2007 with ministers in the (a) Department of Trade and Industry, (b) Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and (c) Department for Business, Innovation and Skills about funds in Ofgem&rsquo;s Fossil Fuel Levy account.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28001</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what correspondence Scottish ministers have had since May 2007 with ministers in the (a) Department of Trade and Industry, (b) Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and (c) Department for Business, Innovation and Skills about funds in Ofgem&rsquo;s Fossil Fuel Levy account.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28002</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions its officials have had since May 2007 with officials in the (a) Department of Trade and Industry, (b) Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and (c) Department for Business, Innovation and Skills about funds in Ofgem&rsquo;s Fossil Fuel Levy account.</p>
