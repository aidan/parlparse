                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5809 Margaret Smith: Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the full and effective implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence; notes the ongoing concerns of teaching unions, education academics and parents&rsquo; organisations about the lack of clarity and the impact of education budget cuts and reduced teacher numbers and training places on implementation plans; agrees that it is essential that the new curriculum and assessment arrangements, including literacy and numeracy tests, are properly resourced over the full four years and that teachers are given the required continuing professional development and support; believes that if this cannot be guaranteed then the Scottish Government must be prepared to give the implementation process more time, and recommends that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning take advice about the timetable from the Curriculum for Excellence Management Board with a view to making a final decision about the timetable for the introduction of the new curriculum by Easter.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5808 Robert Brown: Justice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the decision of the Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police to issue Taser guns to 30 frontline police officers following a three-day training course; recognises the considerable concerns about the safety of Tasers raised by Amnesty International and Epilepsy Scotland among others; notes the view of the First Minister that this is an operational matter for chief constables, requiring no involvement of Scottish ministers; further notes that it was the Home Secretary who had responsibility for signing off the issuing of Tasers to more frontline police officers following a similar pilot in England and Wales; recognises that the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) currently subscribes to guidance on the deployment of firearms and less lethal weapons issued by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO); believes that three days of training is not sufficient for officers with no previous training or experience of handling firearms, and further believes that extending the use of Tasers beyond firearms officers represents a shift in policy, not an operational decision, and requires ministerial sanction following debate in the Parliament.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5807 Richard Lochhead: Brian Pack Inquiry - Single Farm Payment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the Interim Report by the Inquiry into Future Support for Agriculture in Scotland; acknowledges the considerable work that has gone into producing this comprehensive and considered report, and welcomes theinquiry&rsquo;s continuing commitment to extensive stakeholder engagement on the future application of the Common Agricultural Policy in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5806 Irene Oldfather: Irvine Rotary Shop</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Irvine Rotary Club and the Seagate Rotary Club on the opening of a shop in Irvine between 20 and 27 February 2010, which seeks to highlight their charity work, both in the local community and abroad, through initiatives such as the End Polio Now campaign, as well as the contributions to worldwide disaster appeals in Haiti, Thailand, India and Africa; recognises the contribution that Rotary clubs make in communities across Scotland; believes that the exhibition being held in Irvine is a good example of informing people about the valuable charity work undertaken by Rotary, and therefore wishes both the Irvine Rotary Club and the Seagate Rotary Club all the best in their future fundraising endeavours.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5805&diams;   Bill Kidd: Scottish Academy of Literature</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the report of the Literature Working Group, which proposes the creation of a Scottish academy of literature to foster and expand the literary culture of Scotland, shining a light on both authors of the past and those yet to come; welcomes the group&rsquo;s other recommendations such as the establishment of a Gaelic literary magazine, encouraging publishers to publish works in Scots and the setting up of a government body to report on public libraries; agrees with the group that the creation of a Scottish academy of literature is long overdue given that Scotland is the birthplace of UNESCO&rsquo;s first city of literature and that the Royal Scottish Academy was formed in 1826 and the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1723, and believes that, coupled with other initiatives that celebrate literature, such as the Edinburgh International Book Festival and Glasgow&rsquo;s Aye Write festival in March 2010, these recommendations can be successful in ensuring a bright future for Scottish literature.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5804 Ian McKee: Edinburgh Named Europe&rsquo;s Best Small City of the Future</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the City of Edinburgh for being named Europe&rsquo;s best small city of the future for a second successive year by fDi Magazine&rsquo;s European Cities and Regions of the Future; notes that the award was judged on seven criteria including quality of life, business friendliness and economic potential; further notes that the city also came out on top in the best economic potential category, which took into account gross domestic product and employment growth; considers that this award reflects Edinburgh&rsquo;s qualities as a city with a highly skilled workforce, a flourishing and competitive business community, globally recognised expertise in financial services, human and animal life sciences and the creative industries and an excellent quality of life, and believes that this award will provide an essential boost to the city&rsquo;s confidence following the country&rsquo;s deep economic recession.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5803 Brian Adam: Future of Core Store at Gilmerton</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision by the British Geological Survey (BGS) to move the UK continental shelf core and records collections from Gilmerton, Edinburgh, to Keyworth in Nottingham; believes that this move will disadvantage the oil and gas industry, Scottish businesses, academics and students who regularly use the store for study and research; expresses concern at the costs and potential damage of moving the core store; welcomes the recent survey undertaken by the Petroleum Exploration Society of Great Britain (PESGB) into the move, which showed that 77% of members who responded believe that the core store should remain in Edinburgh, with 89% of active users agreeing; understands that only three active users were aware of the consultation exercise undertaken by the Tribal Group on behalf of the BGS; further welcomes the view of PESGB President Henry Allen that a steering group should be formed of all stakeholders to discuss an appropriate way forward, and calls on the BGS or Minister of State for Higher Education and Intellectual Property to stop the move of the core store and address the concerns raised by its users.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5802 Michael Matheson: High Street Mile of Coins in Aid of End Polio Now</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament lauds the efforts of Falkirk citizens in their campaign to eradicate globally the devastating disease of polio; notes that the citizens of Falkirk have taken measures to combat this disease since 1985 when Rotary launched PolioPlus<em>, </em>a multimillion pound initiative to immunise every child in the world; praises this initiative, which contributed to the eventual vaccination of more than two billion children worldwide; recognises with sadness, however, that the disease continues to plague Afghanistan, Nigeria, India and Pakistan, and commends the continued efforts of Falkirk citizens and the four Rotary clubs covering Falkirk district and their aim to collect a mile of coins to place along the town&rsquo;s High Street in aid of Rotary&rsquo;s End Polio Now campaign.</p>
