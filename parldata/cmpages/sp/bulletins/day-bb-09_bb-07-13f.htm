<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4590 Jackie Baillie: Club of Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Helensburgh Sailing Club on the opening of its new clubhouse; notes that the club can claim Olympic gold medalist Mike McIntyre, round the world yachtswoman Emma Richards and Stephen Park OBE as former members; understands that the opening is a culmination of years of fundraising by club members, and wishes the club every success with its new facilities that will undoubtedly give rise to a new generation of Scottish champions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4589 Alex Johnstone: Aberdeen Bus Strike</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the possibility of strike action by First Aberdeen staff; notes that public transport is a lifeline to many people in the city of Aberdeen, especially the elderly and vulnerable; further notes that passengers may be obliged to leave buses and be left at the side of the road; urges the union not to undertake strike action, and hopes that all parties will negotiate an amicable solution that avoids a detrimental impact on communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4588 David Stewart: Eigg Crowned North Regional Winner of Scottish Calor Village of the Year 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the community of the island of Eigg on being named North Regional Winner in the Scottish Calor Village of the Year 2009; welcomes the award of &pound;2,000 for community investment; further notes the comments of Stephen Rennie, Managing Director of Calor Gas, which recognised that the islanders had demonstrated a unique ability to sustain an almost completely self-sufficient island lifestyle with outstanding community spirit, providing everything from electricity to employment, and wishes the people of Eigg well in the next round of the competition.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4587# Ms Wendy Alexander: Robert Tannahill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commemorates the life of Robert Tannahill (1774-1810) also known as &quot;Paisley&rsquo;s Son&quot;; celebrates the bicentenary of his death; recognises the contribution that Robert Tannahill made to Scotland&rsquo;s cultural heritage; notes the impact that his poetry and music has made on Scotland and Paisley, and welcomes the efforts being made by David Mullen to commemorate his anniversary for next year.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4586 Malcolm Chisholm: School Closures in North Edinburgh and Leith</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the proposal to close Royston Primary School and Fort Primary School in the Edinburgh North and Leith constituency; notes that the average number of pupils per primary school in Edinburgh is already the second highest in Scotland; is dismayed that almost two thirds of the proposed revenue savings from primary school closures in Edinburgh are stated by the council to arise from reducing staff costs; believes that closures will therefore increase class sizes and pupil teacher ratios, and calls on the council to concentrate instead on reversing the decline in teacher numbers in Edinburgh and recognising the important and successful role that Royston and Fort primaries play in their respective communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4585 Pauline McNeill: Work Begins on Aircraft Carriers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the first cut of steel for the aircraft carriers that will become HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, large sections of which will be built on the Clyde and at Rosyth Dockyard, providing work for the foreseeable future for nearly 4,000 shipyard workers on the Clyde; further welcomes the commitment of the UK Government to the aircraft carriers that will come into service in 2016; notes the UK Government&rsquo;s view that this work provides the basis for a longer-term sustainable future, thus securing jobs and skills on the Clyde, and further notes that these carriers highlight the performance and ability in Scottish shipbuilding and ship design, which continues to be of a world-class standard, and that this success allows for the largest apprenticeship programme in Scotland and as such represents a major contribution to the Scottish economy.</p>
