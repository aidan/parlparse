          <p><strong>*S1M-3834#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie: Scottish Input to 
            the General Agreement on Trade in Services</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament notes the current negotiations taking place through Her 
            Majesty&#146;s Government on the General Agreement on Trade in Services 
            that covers many areas that are within the Scottish Parliament&#146;s 
            legislative competence; notes the need to feed Scottish concerns into 
            the negotiations, and seeks assurances on the implications of article 
            1.3 that defines only services supplied in the exercise of governmental 
            authority that are supplied neither on a commercial basis nor in competition 
            with one or more service suppliers as exempt.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3833</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Local Government 
            Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament endorses the 
            principle of including in the Local Government Bill powers for the 
            Scottish Ministers to issue directions and guidance to Scottish local 
            authorities in relation to staff transfer matters and agrees that 
            the relevant provisions to confer executive functions on the Scottish 
            Ministers in relation to these matters should be considered by the 
            UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3832#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: University of 
            Edinburgh School of Informatics</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            recognises the severity of the damage caused by the Old Town fire 
            to the University of Edinburgh&#146;s internationally renowned School 
            of Informatics; congratulates the University on the rapid action taken 
            to minimise the impact of the fire on its activities; supports the 
            appeal to rebuild its unique Artificial Intelligence library, and 
            gives its full backing to the University of Edinburgh&#146;s aspirations 
            to accelerate the development of its world-class research, teaching 
            and technology transfer in this field.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3831</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson: Cuban Economic 
            Embargo</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns the United States 
            (US) Government&#146;s four-decade-old economic embargo against the 
            people of Cuba with the Helms-Burton trade barrier; notes the recent 
            legal advice provided to William Grant &amp; Sons, that in the US 
            21-year old Glenfiddich Havana Reserve would fall foul of the trade 
            barrier, purely because the whisky is matured in Cuban rum casks; 
            congratulates William Grant &amp; Sons on persisting with the use 
            of Cuban rum casks despite the difficulties caused with the US market, 
            and calls upon the current US Government to end the unjustified trade 
            embargo against the people of Cuba.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3830#</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: European Commission 
            Directive on Food Supplements</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            that millions of people use food supplements and herbal remedies in 
            the UK each year; regrets that the European Commission has published 
            a directive on food supplements that will firstly reduce the numbers 
            of supplements offered and secondly reduce the potency of those which 
            remain, and, whilst noting Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s assurances 
            that such supplements will be treated as favourably as possible under 
            UK law, considers that the Scottish Executive should do everything 
            within its power to protect the right of consumers to continue to 
            access the full range of supplements currently available.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3828.1</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson: Cockenzie

            concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;the concern of residents, relatives 
            and staff about the future of Cockenzie House Nursing Home; further 
            notes the very substantial increase in funding from the Scottish Executive 
            for nursing home fees in 2002, in addition to the free personal care 
            package, and welcomes the progress of discussions about another substantial 
            uprating in 2003; commends the efforts of East Lothian Council to 
            help the proprietor of Cockenzie House by seeking to take up empty 
            places in the home, and endorses the council&#146;s determination 
            to do everything in its power to safeguard the residents and, while 
            acknowledging the right of the owner to sell Cockenzie House, urges 
            him to resolve the uncertainty by selling the home as a going concern.&quot;</a></p>
