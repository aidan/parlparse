<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5412</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Condemn Sacking of 650 by NCR Dundee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by NCR in Dundee to sack 650 of its workers; recognises that assurances given to the workers&rsquo; union just last year that jobs were safe have turned out to be worthless; believes that the announcement by NCR is not just a severe blow to Dundee but has ominous implications for workers&rsquo; job prospects throughout the manufacturing sector in Scotland; further believes that the NCR decision again highlights the need for greater protection of jobs in Scotland, which can be destroyed on a whim as employers uproot and head east for cheap labour reserves, and offers its full support to Amicus and the entire workforce in efforts they make to save the jobs and secure a future for all workers affected by this dreadful news.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5411</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>4th Edinburgh International Festival of Middle Eastern Spirituality and Peace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the 4th Edinburgh International Festival of Middle Eastern Spirituality and Peace which will take place from Wednesday 7 February to Sunday 11 March 2007; supports the festival&rsquo;s aim to celebrate the diversity contained within the religious, spiritual, educational, cultural, ethnic and international traditions of the Middle East as well as in Scotland; welcomes the opening up of the festival this year to events in other parts of Scotland, and congratulates the organisers, the Edinburgh International Centre for World Spiritualities and the Edinburgh Institute for Advanced Learning, for bringing together people from across all the principal faith and spiritual traditions of Scotland and creating a forum for dialogue and mutual understanding among the religious and spiritual traditions, particularly at a time when negative media images and war in the Middle East are increasingly polarising opinions and exacerbating divisions among our communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5410</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure for existing purposes payable, in consequence of the Act, out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5409</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Scots Language Dictionaries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the long history of Scots language dictionaries, from Jamieson&rsquo;s in 1808 to the 10-volume Scottish National Dictionary completed in 1976, the Dictionary of the Older Scots Tongue completed in 12 volumes in 2002 and the online Dictionary of the Scots Language in 2004, which together put Scotland at the forefront of producers of dictionaries of minority languages; also welcomes the work being done on Faclair na G&agrave;idhlig,&nbsp;and, in order to safeguard the future of these long-term dictionary projects, urges the&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;Executive and other government, commercial and charitable organisations to co-operate in providing the requisite funds for continuing work on them.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5408</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Justice 2 Committee considers the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 in the following order: sections 43 to 46, section 1, schedule 1, sections 2 to 42, sections 47 to 49, schedule 2, section 50, schedule 3 and the long title.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5407</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Support the SFA in Scotland Manager Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses regret that, when the Scottish national football team had shown signs of improvement and potential success and had begun to restore Scotland&rsquo;s pride in the national football team, Walter Smith has chosen to leave that team and a national organisation, in the form of the Scottish Football Association (SFA), with limited resources in favour of working for an &quot;Old Firm&quot; plc steeped in wealth that perpetuates inequality in the national game; supports the SFA in its efforts to gain appropriate compensation, and hopes that an appropriate replacement who will make a long-term commitment to the national team will be placed in post as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5406#</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender History Month</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that February is LGBT History Month and that events will be taking place around Scotland to celebrate the lives of Scottish LGBT people, past and present; congratulates the many organisations that have contributed to LGBT History Month, including voluntary organisations, religious groups, businesses and the Scottish Executive; regrets that LGBT history, from the horrors of the gulags and gas chambers to the achievements of LGBT people in all spheres of life, often remains unwritten and unspoken; believes that this represents a cultural loss to the whole of society; further believes that young LGBT people in particular have a right to learn about their cultural heritage in all its forms, and hopes therefore that many communities, including schools, will participate in LGBT History Month this year and in the future.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5401</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Hospitals Need More Capacity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that Wishaw General Hospital was forced to close to accident and emergency admissions due to lack of capacity and that neighbouring hospitals were placed under increased pressure; notes that other NHS board areas are also at full capacity, often causing long waits on trolleys and multiple transfers between departments for some patients; believes that, with an increasing elderly, dependent and sick population, NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s plans to close emergency services and acute admissions at Monklands Hospital are inherently flawed, when experience demonstrates that an increase in capacity is needed, not a decrease; further believes that the burden of servicing two major PFI projects at a cost of &pound;42.7 million in 2006-07, the second biggest spend on PFI in Scotland, compromises NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s ability to organise services in the interests of patients and communities, and considers that the lack of capacity is compromising quality of care for patients and that a proper needs assessment of capacity and the resources to deliver that capacity is urgently required.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5400</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Covenanters&rsquo; Field, Bothwell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by South Lanarkshire Council to allow house building on the last remnant of the battlefield of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679, known as Covenanters&rsquo; Field, which has been left virtually undisturbed for 327 years; further notes that Covenanters&rsquo; Field was given to the local authority by the Battle of Bothwell Bridge Commemoration Service Committee in the 1980s to be held for safekeeping and protection; welcomes the proposal put forward by Bothwell Community Council to relocate the Covenanters&rsquo; Monument to the field, to establish a garden of remembrance and to develop the field as a tourist attraction by creating a &quot;Covenanters&rsquo; Trail&quot; to commence at the field and follow the Clyde Valley through Dalserf Church and onwards to some of the other Covenanters&rsquo; sites, and calls on the local authority to reconsider its proposals in light of the historic importance and local community opposition to the development of the Covenanters&rsquo; Field.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5392</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Support Faslane 365</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in organising and participating in the Faslane 365 campaign; recognises that this is a campaign of protest and civil disobedience in the cause of upholding international law against the barbaric Trident weapons of mass destruction; understands that protestors place themselves at risk of arrest only because the state refuses to uphold international law and instead arrests and prosecutes those who are attempting to uphold it on spurious and ironic charges of &quot;breach of the peace&quot;; believes that it is the existence of Trident that breaches international peace, and resolves to support Faslane 365 and all peaceful attempts to abolish Trident and to halt any replacement and the escalation of the arms race.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5385*#*</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Awareness of Coeliac Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the average general practitioner has little or no experience of coeliac disease, an extremely debilitating illness that affects one in 100 of the population, of which seven out of eight are undiagnosed; regrets that the lack of knowledge of this condition prevents many people with coeliac disease from receiving early diagnosis, leading to serious complications such as osteoporosis and bowel cancer if left undetected; welcomes the work done by Coeliac UK in providing literature, advice, a helpline and dietary information to address this need, and *believes that* the Scottish Executive *should* promote such measures as it sees fit to ensure that GPs *in the Lothians and throughout Scotland* receive more appropriate training and support to enable them to recognise and to diagnose the disease more accurately.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5380</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>VAT on Fresh Fruit Juice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that VAT on fresh fruit juice is charged at the same rate as that payable on other soft drinks such as lemonade, other fizzy drinks and diluting squashes, many of which are high in sugar or artificial sweeteners, colouring and other additives; recognises the comments of European Commissioner,&nbsp;L&aacute;szl&oacute; Kov&aacute;cs, that the rate of VAT which could be applied to fresh fruit juices in the United Kingdom under the Sixth VAT Directive is a reduced rate of 5%, and&nbsp;urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to the UK Government that it should investigate the benefits of reducing VAT on fresh fruit juice to encourage children, in particular, to choose fresh fruit juices rather than less healthy drinks.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5379</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Turning Up the Heat on Scottish Gas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the announcement by Scottish Gas that it will introduce &pound;5 fines for customers who fail to pay rising fuel bills within 28 days, despite the company making &pound;4 million profit a day; notes the company&rsquo;s growing customer dissatisfaction levels, with many customers refusing to pay on time due to inaccuracies in the way their bills have been calculated, and condemns the practice of bonuses paid to engineers who persuade often elderly customers into having sales staff in their homes to sell them heating systems that they do not require; notes that over one million customers left the company last year after it raised prices by 22%, and urges existing customers to vote with their feet and find an alternative supplier which can provide both value for money and good levels of customer service where they may save as much as &pound;100 to &pound;150 per year.</p>
