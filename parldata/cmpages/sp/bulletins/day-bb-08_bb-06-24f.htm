<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2249</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Withdrawal of School Transport in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s ruling Labour executive to withdraw free transport from 1,500 pupils from August 2008; believes that this decision is completely unnecessary, given that the council had a &pound;15.2 million underspend in 2007-08 while retaining this vital service would cost only &pound;640,000; is concerned that the council spends a smaller share of its total budget on education than any of Scotland&rsquo;s 32 local authorities, despite having Scotland&rsquo;s lowest level of educational attainment; is disappointed that this decision was carried out without any consultation whatsoever with parents, staff or pupils who use the service and was announced to them only at the end of the school year, leaving parents, pupils and staff with little time to react; is perturbed that the ruling Labour group in the council is using this important issue as a political pawn to give the impression that it does not receive adequate funding from the Scottish Government when it is failing to spend resources already allocated, and believes that the council&rsquo;s ruling Labour group should rescind this decision at the earliest possible opportunity and invest some of its underspend on improving services to Glaswegians, particularly in education, and not least by making progress towards reducing class sizes.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Bashir Ahmad<strong>*</strong>, Bob Doris<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2248</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Aircraft Carrier Delay Could Cost Jobs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern over the delay in signing the contract for two new aircraft carriers, which could lead to the loss of jobs at the Clyde shipyards in Glasgow; condemns the reported comments made by Glasgow MPs Mohammad Sarwar and Ian Davidson that if Scotland were to become an independent state it would risk losing up to 50,000 jobs in the defence sector; believes that, by putting political self-interest ahead of the vital Scottish shipbuilding industry and engaging in needless scaremongering, these comments will only serve to cause uncertainty and worry for many workers and their families, and calls on all Scottish MPs to work constructively to safeguard the future of the shipbuilding industry in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2247</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>We&rsquo;ve Got Big Plans for Deaf Children and Young People in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends all deaf young people in Scotland who got involved in the National Deaf Children&rsquo;s Society&rsquo;s (NDCS) largest ever consultation with deaf children in the UK, <em>Change Your World</em>; acknowledges that the results of this national conversation present a unique insight into the opinions of young deaf people on issues that affect them; supports the NDCS as it develops its <em>Big Plans</em> for Scotland&rsquo;s deaf children and young people as a result of the <em>Change Your World </em>consultation; congratulates all those who attended the NDCS event in the Parliament on Wednesday 18 June 2008 to launch the results of the consultation, particularly the pupils from Dingwall Academy and Dalziel High School who led the event with such confidence and maturity and told us how they wanted the world to change, and commits to listening to what these results tell us about being a deaf young person in Scotland today.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2246</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Plan to Ban Mosquitoes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision to be taken by City of Edinburgh Council to ban the Mosquito ultrasonic youth deterrent system; believes that other local authorities should follow Edinburgh&rsquo;s lead in also banning the use of the Mosquito device; expresses concern over the makers of the device Compound Security Systems&rsquo; comments that the council will be unable to stop independent traders from using the device without the co-operation of Lothian and Borders Police, and calls on the police and council&nbsp;to work together to address this concern.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2245</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Save Glasgow&rsquo;s School Buses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of Labour-led Glasgow City Council to alter the distance for which free school bus travel is provided from two miles to three miles, which will affect around 1,500 school children; notes that this move was voted through in February 2008 in the face of fierce objections from SNP opposition on the council and that the move will save &pound;670,000, which is totally unnecessary as the council estimates a growth in its reserves from around &pound;10.7 million under the previous administration to around &pound;30 million under the current SNP government; condemns the decision of the council only to publicise this decision in the run-up to the summer holidays in what appears to be a deliberate ploy to prevent opposition campaigns by local parents against this ill-considered move; believes that the comments of Labour Councillor, Gordon Matheson, gives the game away when he stated that the council is falling into line with &quot;national guidelines&quot; but fails to point out that these are non-statutory and were drawn up under the previous administration in 2003; is concerned that these moves may put at risk child safety and school attendance; demands that the council stops using the city&rsquo;s school children as a political football; believes that the proposals should be halted and that the council should use next year to fully consult parents across all Glasgow&rsquo;s schools to ensure that children can get to school safely and easily, and, in the meantime, wishes local parents who are campaigning against the council&rsquo;s plans, such as those in Glasgow Milton, every success in their campaign.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2244</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Glasgow City Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow City Council on its findings that 72% of Glaswegians would be better off under local income tax as opposed to the unfair council tax, and believes that, given the persistent high levels of multiple deprivation in Glasgow under successive UK Governments, the introduction of a local income tax would contribute substantially to combating poverty in Glasgow and consequently would also combat poverty in all other areas of Scotland, both urban and rural, experiencing high levels of poverty.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2243</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Sealladh na Beinne Moire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the community company, Sealladh na Beinne Moire, on being named as Scottish finalist in the nationwide search for start-up company of the year in the HSBC Start-up Stars Awards; notes that Sealladh na Beinne Moire trades as St&ograve;ras Uibhist and was set up in 2006 on behalf of local residents to purchase the 93,000 acre South Uist Estate for &pound;4.5 million; recognises that the company manages over 850 crofts which are home to 3,000 people and many businesses, and wishes this vibrant and forward-looking company well as it seeks to carry forward a number of major projects to improve the social and economic wellbeing of the estate areas, which cover much of the islands of Eriskay, South Uist and Benbecula.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2242</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Dunipace Clean Up</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Dunipace 1st Brownies Group and the Carronvale Tenants and Residents Association in producing &quot;The Day We Cleaned up our Park&quot;, a film of the day where the children of Dunipace took action and cleaned up the Gala Park in Dunipace; thanks the Brownies, Carronvale Tenants and Residents Association, Falkirk Environmental Trust, Denny Community Council, Denny and Dunipace Heritage Society, the schoolchildren of Denny and Dunipace and Community Green Initiative in supporting this initiative, and believes that small communities such as Dunipace can play an important part in making the world a greener place.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2241</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Maryhill Gala Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Maryhill Community Council, Maryhill Housing Association and Culture and Sport Glasgow on a successful Maryhill Gala Day; notes that this is the first gala day to take place in the area in recent times; applauds the initiative of the organisers and the community, and recognises the contribution of the young performers who took part in the Maryhill&rsquo;s Got Musical Talent competition and, in particular, the worthy winner, Laura Divers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2240</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Sl&agrave;inte N&ograve;s &Ugrave;r</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers, participants and audience of N&ograve;s &Ugrave;r (new style) which took place in Eden Court Theatre, Inverness on 21 June 2008; recognises it is the first Celtic and Scots minority languages song competition of its kind which featured 12 finalists from Wales, Brittany, Ireland and Scotland whose entries were in Gaelic and Scots; applauds the UHI Millennium Institute for organising Voices of the West, a conference on minority languages which ran in conjunction with N&ograve;s &Ugrave;r; welcomes the importance of vibrant Gaelic and Scots languages and heritage that underpin the self-confidence of Scottish culture and believes that friendly competitions like this help to foster a greater togetherness and understanding of similar cultures; congratulates Yr Annioddefol from north Wales and Gwennyn from Brittany on their victory, and wishes them the best of luck when they represent Western Europe in the pan-European final due to take place in Lule&aring;, Sweden on 18 October 2008.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2233</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>The Future of Scotland&rsquo;s Universities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scotland&rsquo;s universities for their good showing in <em>The Times Good University Guide</em>; commends the University of St Andrews for its top-five place; notes that Scotland had St Andrews, Edinburgh and Glasgow universities in the top 20 and Aberdeen, Strathclyde, Stirling, Dundee and Heriot-Watt universities in the top 50 universities in the United Kingdom; further notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Joint Future Thinking Taskforce on Universities will report imminently; believes that the Scottish Government must ensure that universities have sustainable funding that at least matches funding in the rest of the UK to maintain and enhance Scottish universities&rsquo; UK and international standing, and further believes that, unless funding for Scottish universities and student support in Scotland keeps pace with the rest of the UK, the Scottish Government risks squandering the legacy of good performance in the higher education sector left to it by previous administrations.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2233.1</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>The Future of Scotland&rsquo;s Universities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2233) in the name of Claire Baker, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that six of the 13 Scottish universities listed who were listed last year have improved their placings while two have retained the place that they held last year; acknowledges the excellent work of the universities and their staff; notes that this improvement has come about over a period of renewed confidence in Scotland and improved co-operation between the universities and the Scottish Government, and calls on the SNP government to continue its excellent work with Scotland&rsquo;s universities.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2164</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Irish Reject the Lisbon Treaty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the democratic will of the Irish people in rejecting the Lisbon treaty; notes that it is the only country allowing its people a vote on the matter, and regrets that the government of Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP, supported by the Liberal Democrats, denied the British people the right to vote on this important piece of legislation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2164.1</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Irish Reject the Lisbon Treaty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2164) in the name of John Lamont, leave out from &quot;it is&quot; to end and insert &quot;, unlike the United Kingdom, the Irish constitution requires that the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty is put to a referendum and that every party represented in the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann except Sinn F&eacute;in officially campaigned in favour of a &quot;Yes&quot; vote; further notes the comments of the Taoiseach, other political leaders and commentators in the Republic of Ireland, that the &quot;No&quot; vote was heavily influenced by domestic matters rather than just the Lisbon Treaty itself, and believes that the comments of Conservative MPs and MSPs, in criticising the UK for being among the 26 out of 27 EU member states not holding a referendum on the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, highlight hypocrisy and opportunism by David Cameron and his party, given that while in power the Conservative Party never once held a referendum on the ratification of any of the treaties of the European Union or its predecessors including the Treaty of Rome itself, the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, all of which were much more significant in terms of increasing the powers and scope of European institutions.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1953</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of the UK Government to proceed with the construction of two new aircraft carriers, to be named HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, and notes that the new carriers, which are to be built by a consortium of BAE Systems and the VT Group, will sustain the long-term future of shipbuilding on the Clyde, creating or sustaining 3,500 jobs at Scotstoun and Govan Shipyards along with a major expansion of the Rosyth Naval Dockyard on the Forth, and involving a total of more than 10,000 jobs across the UK including work at Portsmouth and Barrow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1953.1</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1953) in the name of Pauline McNeill, insert at end &quot;notes however that the Scottish Affairs Committee&rsquo;s <em>Employment and Skills for the Defence Industry in Scotland</em> <em>report </em>expressed concern that the UK Government&rsquo;s delay in signing the contract may lead to job losses, and calls on the UK Government to act now to resolve this situation.&quot;</p>
