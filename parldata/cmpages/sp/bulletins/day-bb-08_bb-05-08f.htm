<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1860</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Getting it Right for Every Deaf Child</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates Deaf Awareness Week from 5 to 11 May 2008; shares the vision of the National Deaf Children&rsquo;s Society (NDCS) of a world without barriers for every deaf child; acknowledges that the NDCS estimates that there are almost 3,000 deaf children in Scotland today; agrees that the family is the most important influence on a deaf child&rsquo;s development in the early years; acknowledges, however, that 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents with little or no previous experience of deafness; is aware that Universal Newborn Hearing Screening, introduced in Scotland in 2005, means that more deaf children are being identified earlier; agrees that this should be an opportunity for parents to access co-ordinated support from professionals to help them to unlock their deaf child&rsquo;s potential from the moment of diagnosis; recognises the crucial role that qualified professionals working within the health, education, social care and voluntary sector play in providing support to parents in providing emotional support and developing language and communication skills with their child in the early years; is aware of the fact that in 2003 the Department for Education and Skills published detailed guidance, <em>Developing Early Intervention/Support Services for Deaf Children and their Families,</em> for professionals working with deaf children and their families in the early years setting in England; is concerned that there is currently no such national guidance for professionals working with deaf children and their families in Scotland, meaning that services vary throughout the country, and therefore endorses NDCS&rsquo;s call for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s forthcoming early years strategy to acknowledge and consider the specific support needs of deaf children and their families in the early years and commit to producing detailed guidance for professionals working with deaf children and their families in the early years setting.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1859</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>National Breastfeeding Awareness Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes National Breastfeeding Awareness Week which takes place from 11 to 17  May 2008; acknowledges the importance of the week in raising awareness of, and support for, breastfeeding; further acknowledges the extent of the challenges faced in Scotland in facilitating a cultural shift in favour of breastfeeding and securing improvements in rates of uptake and duration; notes the findings of recent research in Belarus which suggests that breastfed babies tend to have higher IQ; further notes with interest the views of health visiting experts in Leeds which indicate that a woman&rsquo;s choice to start and sustain breastfeeding is highly influenced by the support of her partner; considers that more work must be done at a national level to promote support for breastfeeding among men and to challenge negative attitudes where required; believes that more general information and assistance is required to promote breastfeeding as an important public health priority, and calls on the Scottish Executive to promote material aimed specifically at men to act as a mechanism for discussion to ensure that men are made aware of the advantages of breastfeeding and encouraged to offer support to partners.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1858</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>National Epilepsy Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the contribution made by Epilepsy Scotland and fellow Scottish members of the Joint Epilepsy Council of the UK and Ireland (JEC) to raise awareness and combat the stigma associated with epilepsy; supports these organisations in marking National Epilepsy Week; acknowledges that just 50 years ago some people with uncontrollable seizures were hidden away in asylums or sent to live in epilepsy &quot;colonies&quot;; congratulates JEC organisations in challenging this kind of segregation and informing public attitudes; applauds initiatives by the Cross-Party Group on Epilepsy and Scottish JEC members to educate school staff and pupils about epilepsy; values the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ongoing support for Epilepsy Scotland&rsquo;s Employer of the Year award which recognises epilepsy best practice, and praises the awareness training provided for the Parliament&rsquo;s own staff so that epilepsy is no longer hidden and misunderstood.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1857</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Woolf Review Highlights UK Hypocrisy on Bribery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Lord Woolf&rsquo;s review of BAE Systems plc, which calls for tougher anti-bribery measures, and BAE&rsquo;s commitment to implement these recommendations in full; notes that in so doing the company would be an example to the UK Government in terms of fighting corruption; deplores the fact that the United Kingdom has, to date, not prosecuted a single company for foreign bribery offences, as required under the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery in International Business Transactions; further notes the highly critical assessments of the OECD regarding the failure of the UK to enact effective anti-corruption legislation for foreign bribery offences and to otherwise adequately enforce the convention, and considers that the UK stance in persuading developing countries to implement governance reforms whilst failing to act to curb corruption at home is hypocritical, thereby damaging the implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption, which depends on the global north and the global south pulling together to fight international corruption.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1856</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Possible Replacement of Disability Living Allowance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the present system of payment of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which provides money to disabled people based on the severity of their impairment rather than on the level of their income, should continue; deprecates UK Government proposals to remove this money from disabled people in order to support the implementation of &quot;individualised budgets&quot; as this would lead to uncertainty with regard to the level of individual budgets provided, to a loss of portability of the benefit and to the introduction of stigmatising means-testing, and accordingly asks for immediate discussions to take place between Scottish and UK ministers on this proposal, which has significant implications for issues of devolved responsibility, and for the outcome of these discussions to be brought before the Parliament and into the public arena.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1855</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Garnock Valley Rugby Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Garnock Valley Rugby Club on winning the Scottish Hydro Electric Shield on Saturday 3 May 2008 at Murrayfield; notes that Garnock Valley defeated Kirkcaldy, a team from the division above, after an enthralling match, won 31-24 by Garnock Valley  in the dying minutes; recognises that the victory was all the more remarkable as Garnock had to play without captain, Graeme Reid, and lock, Willie Clark, who were involved elsewhere as best man and groom that day, with Paul McCrorie, the stand-in skipper, delivering victory with his third try three minutes from time; is aware that hundreds of supporters travelled from North Ayrshire to cheer on their team and that the wedding guests were able to join the team at their post-match celebrations in Beith; salutes the hard work of everyone connected with Garnock Valley RC over many years culminating in this historic victory after near misses in the past and notes the comments by club president, Billy Walker, that it was &quot;definitely the best day in the club&rsquo;s history&quot;; acknowledges that Garnock Valley RC are a real family club with all but two of the final 22 players being home-grown, and hopes and believes that Garnock Valley RC will now go from strength to strength, ensuring the continued growth and popularity of rugby in the Garnock Valley and across North Ayrshire.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1854</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Rangers in the UEFA Cup Final</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Rangers FC on its success in the UEFA Cup this season and for reaching the UEFA Cup Final against Zenit St Petersburg at the City of Manchester Stadium on the 14 May 2008; notes that over 10,000 Rangers fans travelled to Florence for its semi-final victory over Fiorentina, where the local authority organised fan zones and a large screen to show the match, with Rangers fans being congratulated on their excellent behaviour; recognises that over 100,000 Rangers fans intend to travel to Manchester to enjoy and experience the UEFA Cup Final atmosphere, with only 13,000 tickets allocated to Rangers fans; welcomes Manchester City Council&rsquo;s decision to establish fan zones in the city but is disappointed that there are no plans to set up large screens to show the match in the fan zones and hopes that, in the interests of fans, Manchester City Council will set up large screens to show the match, and wishes Rangers FC success in the UEFA Cup Final.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1853</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>The Fife Diet</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the ongoing committment of the volunteers who created, and are living on, the Fife Diet; recognises their commitment to local food and eating a diet based on produce from Fife, as opposed to imported into Scotland from around the world; further recognises that eating locally grown high-quality food can help to reduce carbon emissions, as well as improving Scotland&rsquo;s diet and building local economies, and believes that the Scottish Government should follow the example of community projects like the Fife Diet in order to support and promote healthy, low-carbon, local, fresh food as part of its national food policy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1851</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Presidency of Europe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes recent reports that heads of government across Europe are increasingly opposed to Tony Blair being nominated for the position of President of the European Union; believes that whoever takes up this position should be capable of uniting the people of Europe behind shared values of peace and justice, and further believes that under no circumstances could the former Prime Minister fulfil such a role, given his responsibility for taking the United Kingdom into an illegal war in Iraq against the wishes of a majority of people in the UK and the European Union.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1849.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>Effective Public Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1849) in the name of Bruce Crawford, insert at end &quot;believes that there is scope for continuous improvement in the design and delivery of public services, and rejects the notion that improvements in public services can only be achieved by increased levels of public spending.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1849.2</strong> <strong>Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Effective Public Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1849) in the name of Bruce Crawford, leave out from &quot;with the aim&quot; to end and insert &quot;but recognises that public service cuts seen all over Scotland are undermining those very services and that the cuts being experienced are not the result of reducing duplication, bureaucracy and overlaps but rather a failure to invest by the Scottish Government.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1849.3</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Effective Public Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1849) in the name of Bruce Crawford, leave out from &quot;opportunity&quot; to end and insert &quot;commitment from successive Scottish administrations to reduce waste, bureaucracy and duplication in Scotland&rsquo;s public sector; notes with concern the current administration&rsquo;s superficial approach, which appears to be driven by numerical and financial targets alone rather than principles of good governance, and the failure of the Scottish Government to consult properly with the interests affected by key decisions, and regrets that these decisions were taken without parliamentary approval.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1848.1</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Meeting Scotland&rsquo;s Housing Needs</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1848) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end &quot;regrets the failure of the Scottish Government to actively promote housing stock transfer by local authorities to community-based housing associations, with the approval of tenants, and urges the Scottish Government to co-operate with HM Treasury and councils to achieve the substantial debt write-offs of over &pound;2 billion which are available and thereby facilitate new investment in social housing.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1848.2</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Meeting Scotland&rsquo;s Housing Needs</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1848) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;calls on the Scottish Government to facilitate discussion and mediation between Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) and the relevant local housing organisations to ensure that second stage transfers proceed speedily and equitably in the interests of all tenants and urges the Scottish Government to bring forward a coherent strategy for all of Scotland&rsquo;s housing needs and, in particular, agrees that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing should ensure that the Mazars report into second stage transfer issues in GHA is subject to open, transparent and independent scrutiny.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1848.3</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Meeting Scotland&rsquo;s Housing Needs</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1848) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end &quot;regrets that after two parliamentary debates on the subject since the budget was passed, the Scottish Government has still failed to come forward with clear figures on its housing plans across all sector and tenure types including the number of affordable rented houses to be built from 2008 to 2011, and has further failed to produce a clear trajectory for how it intends to meet its commitment to abolish unintentional homelessness by 2012; calls for improved energy efficiency to be a key objective in plans for new housing, and opposes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals for large scale procurement put forward in <em>Firm Foundations</em>.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1843</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Housing Association and Second Stage Transfers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Stock Valuation Study on Secondary Stock Transfer by Glasgow Housing Association (GHA), produced by Mazars LLP; notes that second stage transfers have been publicly stated to be a priority for GHA and the Scottish Government; notes that the Mazars report confirms criticisms of the valuation methodology used by GHA, particularly the failure to disaggregate entire cost categories, contingency costs, management costs or central overhead costs and the failure to account for the reduced and delayed call on GHA&rsquo;s private finance facility; notes that these valuation issues appear to compromise the principle of financial neutrality and to render individual stock transfers less viable, and calls on the Scottish Government to facilitate discussion and mediation between GHA and the relevant local housing organisations to ensure that second stage transfers proceed speedily and equitably in the interests of all tenants.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1839*#*</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Family Law Disputes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that current arrangements for settling family law disputes could be improved and that current law still discriminates against parents who are not married; notes that parents can find it difficult or impossible to enforce contact orders where the other parent is unco-operative and that disputes where broken families live in more than one jurisdiction within the United Kingdom are unnecessarily difficult to resolve; further notes that these issues are particularly relevant due to recent cases in the north east; encourages current moves by Scotland&rsquo;s legal profession towards collaborative dispute resolution, and notes with interest the new system of less adversarial trials being developed in Australia.</p>
