            <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Kvaerner Energy, Clydebank</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that the Kvaerner Energy employees at Clydebank face an uncertain 
            future under the planned change of management; further notes the modest 
            reassurances sought by the employees over their future employment, 
            namely the maintenance by the new owners of all current Kvaerner employment 
            conditions including the enhanced redundancy package for all employees 
            and written guarantees from the new owners that the current Kvaerner 
            pension plan arrangements and conditions will be honoured, that there 
            will be no new redundancies after the takeover and the securing of 
            a General Electric workload before the end of 2002, and that, in the 
            event of redundancies after 2002, any redundancy payments will be 
            on at least the same enhanced terms as Kvaerner offered during 1999-2000; 
            and fully supports the workforce in its efforts to secure these conditions, 
            and believes that government intervention through the already established 
            Kvaerner Energy Working Party should be geared to secure these aims.</font></p>

            leadership, poor communication between the Trust and its staff, inadequate

            and less than robust financial procedures, leading to inaccuracies
