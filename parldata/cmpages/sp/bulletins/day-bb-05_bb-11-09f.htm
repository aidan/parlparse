<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only  printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the  complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is  published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged  for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for  debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol  (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in  the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party  support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a  declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3544 Frances Curran: First  Bus Puts Profits Before People&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament is concerned at  First Bus withdrawing bus services in outlying areas of Scotland against the  wishes of the local communities; notes that the withdrawal of bus services in  the Twechar area, which was not communicated to the local community until the  last minute, has left some people with no means to get to their work; is  appalled at the arrogant attitude of First Bus management, based in Glasgow,  that they do not have to provide a service on any route, that it is well within  their rights to cut a service if it is not profitable and that the view of the  local community is irrelevant; believes that First Bus&rsquo;s assertion in its code  of business ethics that it will conduct its business &ldquo;with honesty, integrity  and openness&rdquo; is an empty statement; further believes that, in future,  operators&rsquo; licences should only be issued when there is a guarantee that  certain bus routes within the operating area will be maintained, and notes that  we are now seeing the real effect of privatisation of public transport, where  bus operators are more concerned with their shareholders&rsquo; profits than  providing good bus services, can cherry pick the profitable routes and, in this  case, force Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) to use public money to pay  for an inadequate and reduced service on the routes which First Bus has  cancelled which, to add insult to injury, means that SPT is giving the money to  First Bus to run these reduced services.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3543 Richard Lochhead: Energy  Policy&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament considers it unacceptable that in energy-rich  Scotland fuel poverty blights our society; notes with concern that, despite  Scotland possessing massive energy resources, urgent action is required to  avoid an energy gap in the next decade; calls for the development of an energy  policy for Scotland that will deliver security of supply, affordability,  self-sufficiency and energy efficiency; recognises that the transmission  charges for power generators, as permitted by the UK Government, will undermine  these objectives; rejects nuclear power in favour of an energy mix that  includes making Scotland the world leader in renewable energy and carbon  capture and storage technology; believes that such a policy will boost our  economy and meet our environmental obligations, and recognises that the  Scottish Parliament requires the necessary energy powers and control over our  oil and gas resources to deliver the nation&rsquo;s energy needs in the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3542 Campbell Martin: Teaching  of Scottish History&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern media reports  that the Minister for Education and Young People, Peter Peacock, favours teaching  history as part of other subjects, such as modern studies; considers that this  would be a retrograde step and that, instead, the Scottish Executive should  ensure that the teaching of the history of Scotland should be a specific core  element of the general education of every pupil in Scottish schools; further  considers that Scottish history is the retelling of the stories that shaped our  nation; agrees with the view of Nigerian writer, Ben Okri, that &ldquo;to poison a  nation, poison its stories&rdquo;, and considers that diluting the teaching of  Scottish history or incorporating it into another subject would be to poison  Scotland&rsquo;s stories.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3541 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business Motion&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament  agrees that consideration of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1 be  completed by 24 February   2006.</p>
<p>Supported by: George  Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3540 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business Motion&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament  agrees that consideration of the Interests of Members of the Scottish  Parliament Bill at Stage 1 be completed by 16 December 2005.</p>
<p>Supported by: George  Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3539 Fiona Hyslop: Scottish  History&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with serious concern the proposals by the  Scottish Executive to make history history in S1 and S2; asserts the importance  of children in Scotland having a firm understanding and appreciation of  Scottish heritage, culture and history; recognises and supports creative ways  to weave this into every subject in the curriculum providing a Scottish  perspective; rejects, however, any attempt to remove the stand-alone subject of  history from S1 and S2 in schools in Scotland, and regrets this suggestion by  any Scottish education minister, reflecting that such a move would not be even  countenanced in other countries who have a pride in promoting their nation&rsquo;s  history.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr  Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, Roseanna Cunningham<strong>*</strong>, Mr John Swinney<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>,  Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>,  Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Mr  Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Shona Robison<strong>*</strong>, Campbell  Martin<strong>*</strong>, Jim Mather<strong>*</strong>, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3538 Ms Rosemary Byrne: History  Teaching in Secondary Schools&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament believes that far too  little Scottish history is currently taught in Scottish schools and that this  leaves young Scots with little or no appreciation of their heritage; further  believes that this will pose grave difficulties for a future multi-cultural  Scotland because a society which is not in touch with its own culture is  unlikely to be able to accommodate the cultures of others, and therefore views  with grave concern the Minister for Education and Young People&rsquo;s stated view  that history need no longer be taught as a separate subject in the first two  years of secondary schooling.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3537 Mrs Nanette Milne: World  Radiography Day 2005&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes World  Radiography Day 2005 on 8 November; notes the important role of diagnostic and  therapeutic radiographers in Scotland&rsquo;s health system; notes that essential  screening services provide an absolutely invaluable method of early detection  of many life-threatening diseases, and further notes the current shortage of  radiographers in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3536 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the  Parliamentary Bureau: Environmental  Assessment (Scotland) Bill&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the  Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall,  subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limits indicated  (each time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any  periods when other business is under consideration or when the meeting of the  parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division  in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress):</p>

<p>Supported by: George  Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>S2M-3531*#* Murdo Fraser: David Livingstone: Explorer, Missionary,  Anti-Slave Campaigner and Doctor&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that 17 November  2005 marks the 150th anniversary of David Livingstone being the first European  to discover the Victoria Falls; believes that the anniversary should be used to  mark the important work which David Livingstone undertook as an explorer,  missionary, anti-slave campaigner and doctor, having created strong ties with  African nations and being celebrated in Zambia as a national hero for bringing  Christianity to the country; notes that David Livingstone&rsquo;s strong campaigning  against slavery and for African rights is still an inspiration to people today;  believes that his work should inspire a new generation of Scots, and believes  that the Scottish Executive should use this occasion to celebrate the work and  life of David Livingstone.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3519.1 Robin Harper: Call  for Withdrawal of Motion to Remove Haddock From Sale&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to  motion (S2M-3519) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &ldquo;but notes that  the stock size still relies on one year class, 1999, and that evidence of a new  healthy year class is not yet fully established, so caution should still be  exercised over the exploitation of the present stock of haddock.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3507*#* Colin Fox: Scotland&rsquo;s Social Housing Provision&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises that  affordable social housing is in short supply across Scotland in both rural and  urban areas and welcomes all efforts to ensure that everyone gets the  opportunity to live in a decent home fit for the 21st century; welcomes the  decision of Midlothian Council, for example, to build 1,000 new council houses;  urges all council tenants in Edinburgh to make their views known in the stock  transfer referendum scheduled for later this month, and believes that local  tenant-led participation is crucial to the effective democratic management of  social housing projects all across Scotland.</p>
