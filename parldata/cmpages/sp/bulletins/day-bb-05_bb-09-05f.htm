          <p><b>*S2M-3223</b> <b>Michael Matheson:</b> <b>Support for the Scottish Football Team</b>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) as the governing body of football within Scotland; praises its role within FIFA and UEFA; strongly agrees with the SFA&rsquo;s views on a British football team for the 2012 Olympic Games, and disagrees with Sepp Blatter, FIFA President, for his recent misguided and ill-thought-out remarks which will have little or no support amongst those who run football in Scotland and, more importantly, those who support it.</p>

notes that the eminent climate specialist, Professor Kerry Emanuel, published research in the magazine, <i>Nature</i>, on 4 August 2005 which concluded that the destructive potential of tropical storms, such as Hurricane Katrina, had doubled over the last 30 years primarily because ocean surfaces have grown warmer; further notes that the majority of scientific opinion believes that such rises in temperature are attributable to the climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions; notes that federal budgets for flood control in Louisiana have been slashed and that oil company canals in Louisiana have contributed significantly to the loss of over 40 miles of wetland which provided a natural buffer to storms and flood; notes that national guardsmen and helicopters from the hurricane-affected areas of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi are currently deployed in Iraq and therefore unavailable for search and rescue, evacuation and distribution of aid relief work, and believes, therefore, that far from being a natural disaster, the scale of human tragedy now unfolding is largely man-made and attributable to the bankrupt policies pursued by US President George W Bush.</p><p><b>*S2M-3221</b> <b>Patrick Harvie:</b> <b>Removal of Asylum Seekers&rsquo; Children</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland, Professor Kathleen Marshall, for raising the issue of the inhumane methods used by the UK Government in the removal and detention of children prior to deportation; endorses Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) which states that governments should protect children from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse; considers that the early morning raids being carried out on vulnerable families by officers in body armour violate this article as well as the spirit of the UNCRC; agrees with Professor Marshall that this treatment amounts to terrorising families; is concerned that Section 9 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 will worsen this situation and lead to many more families being subjected to this inhumane treatment, and calls on the UK Government to repeal this legislation and to ensure that all asylum and immigration policy is consistent with the UNCRC.</p><p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<b>*</b>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<b>*</b>, Campbell Martin<b>*</b>, Mr John Swinney<b>*</b>, Shiona Baird<b>*</b>, Chris Ballance<b>*</b>, Mark Ballard<b>*</b>, Rob Gibson<b>*</b>, Robin Harper<b>*</b>, Alex Neil<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3220#</b> <b>John Scott:</b> <b>The Future Provision of Emergency and Unscheduled Care Services in Ayrshire and Arran</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the plans by NHS Ayrshire and Arran to institute a public consultation on the future provision of emergency and unscheduled care in Ayrshire; expresses concern that this consultation only includes options to downgrade the existing accident and emergency unit at Ayr Hospital, and expects NHS Ayrshire and Arran to abide by the spirit of the report, <i>Building a Health Service Fit for the Future,</i> by Professor David Kerr by listening to the views of both the public and health professionals in Ayrshire and taking full account of these views before reaching a decision on the future of accident and emergency care provision in the county.</p><p><b>*S2M-3219#</b> <b>John Farquhar Munro:</b> <b>Future of Crofting</b>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of crofting to the social and economic life of the Highlands and Islands and wishes to see the continuation of sustainable crofting communities; shares the concerns of crofting communities, such as those in Skye and Lochalsh and throughout the crofting counties, regarding the threat to crofting communities from the lack of action by the Crofters Commission over the decrofting of land and sale of crofts, and from absentee crofters and dereliction; believes that crofting tenancies should not be sold on the open market which is currently allowing local people to be outbid by those with no understanding of, or long-term commitment to, crofting and the crofting community, and further believes that if this continues it will, in a generation, lead to the end of crofting in everything but name.</p><p><b>*S2M-3218</b> <b>Mr Mark Ruskell:</b> <b>Stop Climate Chaos</b>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Stop Climate Chaos, the coalition of environment, development and faith organisations which has been formed to tackle climate change; acknowledges the strength of concern about climate change which exists within many organisations in the voluntary sector; believes that effective international action to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases across all sectors is urgently required, and urges the Scottish Executive to act without delay to ensure that all its policies are climate proofed.</p><p>Supported by: Shiona Baird<b>*</b>, Mark Ballard<b>*</b>, Patrick Harvie<b>*</b>, Robin Harper<b>*</b>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<b>*</b>, Chris Ballance<b>*</b>, Mr John Swinney<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3217</b> <b>Mark Ballard:</b> <b>Folding Bicycles</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that folding bicycles are a useful part of an integrated, sustainable transport system; further notes that such folding bicycles reduce to the size of a medium suitcase; additionally notes that, while other objects of similar size are allowed onto buses, travellers with folding bicycles are frequently refused access to buses with their bicycles, and calls on bus companies to revise any such policy that operates to the detriment of integrated sustainable transport.</p><p><b>*S2M-3216</b> <b>Frances Curran:</b> <b>Condolences to the People of Baghdad</b>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its condolences to the people of Baghdad, where over 600 people were killed when panic swept through a crowd of pilgrims over claims that suicide bombers were present; notes that this tragic event underlines the fear and lack of security in Iraq, and offers sympathy to the ordinary people who live with this insecurity every day.</p><p><b>*S2M-3215</b> <b>Christine Grahame:</b> <b>Goats, A Pair of Oxen and a Plough</b>&mdash;That the Parliament, particularly in the year of the Make Poverty History campaign, recognises the important contribution made by Veterinary Assistance and International Development (VETAID), a member of VSF Europa (Veterinaries Sans Frontiers), located at Pentlands Science Park, Penicuik, and a not-for-profit charitable organisation whose remit is working for a reduction in poverty and an increase in food security of people dependent on livestock; commends projects such as the Machakos Project in Kenya, which works with a group of widows who support 40 child or grandparent-led households by providing in some instances two or three goats, a small breeding flock of chickens and training in livestock-keeping and notes that locally-based organisations will receive a pair of oxen and a plough; notes that this typifies the small-scale modestly resourced project which develops self-reliance, and therefore commends VETAID for its simple, direct and effective interventions in making poverty history for some.</p><p><b>*S2M-3214</b> <b>Eleanor Scott:</b> <b>Sustainable Timber Certification Standards</b>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification scheme for sustainably produced timber; notes that this is the only certification scheme that is generally accepted by all stakeholders, including environment groups, as ensuring environmentally and socially responsible timber sourcing; further notes its concern that alternative certification schemes, including the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), represent a dilution of standards for sustainability as assessed by the Central Point for Expertise on Timber, established by the UK Government, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that FSC certification remains the standard for public procurement in Scotland.</p><p><b>*S2M-3213</b> <b>John Swinburne:</b> <b>Big Lottery Seniors Fund</b>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of the Young People&rsquo;s Fund by the Big Lottery Fund, allowing young people to access directly the grant distribution process and encouraging the youth of Scotland to contribute positively to their communities; notes, however, that no similar scheme is to be set up for the older sections of society; further notes the sizable proportion of lottery players who are senior citizens, and, recognising the wide network of pensioners&rsquo; groups and elderly forums who could make a positive input, urges the Scottish Executive to encourage the Big Lottery Fund to introduce a Seniors Fund, to be set up with the same purpose as the Young People&rsquo;s Fund, allowing our older citizens to use their experience for the positive benefit of our communities.</p><p><b>*S2M-3212</b> <b>Shiona Baird:</b> <b>Eco Prize for Creativity</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dundee University-based artists, Dalziel and Scullion, on winning the Eco Prize for Creativity 2005; welcomes the new annual award established by the Eco Trust, Friends of the Earth Scotland and Scotland&rsquo;s Centre for Architecture, Design and the City at The Lighthouse for contributing to a much-needed informed public debate on the environment in Scotland, and recognises the vital role that visual art has to play in stimulating that debate.</p><p>Supported by: Rob Gibson<b>*</b>, Patrick Harvie<b>*</b>, Mark Ballard<b>*</b>, Robin Harper<b>*</b>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<b>*</b>, Chris Ballance<b>*</b>, Shona Robison<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3211</b> <b>Lewis Macdonald:</b> <b>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (Scotland) Order 2005</b>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (Scotland) Order 2005 (SSI 2005/415) be approved.</p><p>Supported by: Mr Andy Kerr<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3210</b> <b>Lewis Macdonald:</b> <b>The Draft Mental Health (Cross-Border Transfer: Patients Subject to Detention Requirement or Otherwise in Hospital) (Scotland) Regulations 2005</b>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the draft Mental Health (Cross-border transfer: patients subject to detention requirement or otherwise in hospital) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 be approved.</p><p>Supported by: Mr Andy Kerr<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3209</b> <b>Lewis Macdonald:</b> <b>The Draft Mental Health (Safety and Security) (Scotland) Regulations 2005</b>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the draft Mental Health (Safety and Security) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 be approved.</p><p>Supported by: Mr Andy Kerr<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3208</b> <b>Lewis Macdonald:</b> <b>The Draft Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (Modification of Enactments) Order 2005</b>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the draft Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (Modification of Enactments) Order 2005 be approved.</p><p>Supported by: Mr Andy Kerr<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3207</b> <b>Lewis Macdonald:</b> <b>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No. 8) (Scotland) Order 2005</b>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No. 8) (Scotland) Order 2005 (SSI 2005/410) be approved.</p><p>Supported by: Mr Andy Kerr<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3206</b> <b>Mr Tom McCabe:</b> <b>The Draft Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Amendment of Specified Authorities) Order 2005</b>&mdash;That the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that the draft Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Amendment of Specified Authorities) Order 2005 be approved.</p><p>Supported by: George Lyon<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3205</b> <b>Mr Tom McCabe:</b> <b>The Draft Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Treatment of Office or Body as Specified Authority) Order 2005</b>&mdash;That the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that the draft Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Treatment of Office or Body as Specified Authority) Order 2005 be approved.</p><p>Supported by: George Lyon<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3204#</b> <b>Murdo Fraser:</b> <b>Planning Applications for Wind Power Developments</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 17 planning applications for onshore wind power developments have been referred to ministers on appeal after being refused by local authorities since 1999; is concerned at the high number of applications that are referred to ministers after they are democratically rejected at local level; believes that, when a rejected application is referred to ministers on appeal, the Scottish Executive should ensure that a public inquiry is held in order to have all issues considered and aired in public; further believes that all groups involved with wind farm applications, which include local authorities, community councillors, anti and pro-wind farm action groups, wind farm developers and the general public, agree that the current planning strategy and guidelines are inadequate, and considers that Scotland needs a national renewable energy strategy with up-to-date national guidelines for the siting of onshore wind farms.</p><p>Supported by: Alex Johnstone<b>*</b>, Phil Gallie<b>*</b>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<b>*</b>, Derek Brownlee<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3203</b> <b>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</b> <b>Business Motion</b>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>
