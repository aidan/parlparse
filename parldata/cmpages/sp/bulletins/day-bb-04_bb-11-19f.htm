          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2042</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>The Continued Harassment and Abuse of Mordechai Vanunu by the Israeli State</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament strongly condemns the latest detention of Mordechai Vanunu on alleged suspicion of passing on classified information on Israel&rsquo;s nuclear weapons programme to foreign journalists; notes that Mordechai Vanunu has served 18 years in jail in solitary confinement for making public Israel&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal; further notes that, when Mordechai was released earlier this year, his civil and human rights were further restricted and abused by the Israeli authorities refusing to allow him a passport, banning his contact with foreigners except with permission and barring him from meeting the foreign press and broadcast media and from giving media interviews; believes that Mr Vanunu is not a threat to the Israeli State but is a beacon of peace, justice and integrity at a time when world leaders seem intent on war and destruction, and calls on the Scottish Executive to actively campaign and speak out on behalf of Mordechai Vanunu and to make representations to the Israeli Government for the immediate release and cessation of harassment of Mr Vanunu.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2041</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Colombian Green Presidential Candidate, Ingrid Betancourt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great concern that Ingrid Betancourt, Presidential candidate and Leader of the Colombian Green Party (Partido Verde Oxigeno) has now been held for 1,000 days by FARC (The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) having been abducted on 23 February 2002; recognises that before her abduction, and despite threats to her life, Ingrid Betancourt was a brave champion of peace and democracy in her troubled country, and requests that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government redouble its representations to the Colombian Government to do everything in its power to secure the safe release of Ingrid and her campaign manager Clara Rojas.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2040</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>BAFTA Scotland Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its disappointment that the BAFTA Scotland awards ceremony was not shown on either BBC or any of the commercial TV franchises serving Scotland; regards this as a lost opportunity to showcase the best of Scottish talent and promote the industry, and congratulates Paula Sage for her Best First Time Performance Award for &quot;Afterlife&quot;, demonstrating the wide spectrum of talent within the Scottish film and television industries.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2039</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Fluoride in Public Water Supply</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Scottish Executive for listening to the views expressed in response to its consultation on improving the oral health of Scotland&rsquo;s children; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s commitment not to change the current legislation on fluoridation of water supplies, and believes that Scotland&rsquo;s poor oral health record can be more effectively tackled by promoting increased action in schools and through the health visitor network than by adding fluoride to the water supply.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Margaret Smith<strong>*</strong>, Jeremy Purvis<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2038#</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Knife Crime in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the unacceptable number of incidents involving knife crime in Scotland and particularly in the east end of Glasgow; believes that the Scottish Executive, Strathclyde police and other key agencies need to work more effectively to tackle this problem; considers that a range of measures to deal with knife crime are required, and believes that the Executive should consider measures such as restricting access to the purchase of knives, ensuring appropriate programmes are in place to educate young people on the dangers and consequences of carrying and using knives, speedier and effective sentencing for those convicted of knife crime and ensuring that the police have effective powers to deal with those who carry and use knives.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2037</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Stop Smoking Message at Football Grounds</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that positive action is necessary to help ease the crisis facing Scottish football clubs due to the withholding of copyright payments by pools companies for the use of fixture lists on their pools coupons at a cost to all clubs of &pound;20,000 per annum and therefore believes that, in order to alleviate this crisis, to promote healthy-living issues and to sustain the future development of youth football, the Scottish Executive should divert some of its extensive budget, which is currently spent on television advertising, to renting from the Scottish Football Association the 20-foot-diameter centre circle at all major Scottish football grounds to exhibit a 314 square feet &quot;No Smoking&quot; logo which will advertise an anti-smoking message, reaching millions of people every week during televised matches and simultaneously sending out an SoS to &quot;Stop our Smoking&quot; and &quot;Save our Soccer&quot;.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2036#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Help to Stub Out Smoking</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Scottish Executive proposing to end smoking in enclosed public places; notes the cross-party support for measures to tackle this issue; further notes the scientific consensus on the damage that tobacco smoke does to human health, and considers that the Executive should maintain its commitment to the comprehensive ban, recognise that smoking is an addiction and make an ongoing financial commitment in order that this addiction can be controlled on an continuing basis.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: John Swinburne<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>, Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2035</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>No More Bhopals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 3 December 2004 marks the 20th anniversary of the world&rsquo;s worst peacetime chemical disaster in Bhopal, India, in which 27 tonnes of lethal gases leaked from Union Carbide&rsquo;s pesticide factory, immediately killing 8,000 people and poisoning thousands of others from toxic exposure in the years since; notes that at least 150,000 people, including children born to parents who survived the disaster, are still suffering from exposure-related health effects; supports the demands of survivors and relatives for justice by calling for the Dow Chemical Company, which now wholly owns Union Carbide, to ensure the clean-up of contamination in Bhopal, to release medical information about the toxicity of methyl isocyanate and poison gases, to arrange for the long-term medical treatment and rehabilitation of survivors, to arrange for the long-term economic rehabilitation of survivors whose livelihoods have suffered as a consequence of the disaster and to produce Union Carbide to face trial in the ongoing criminal proceedings in India, and calls for the international community to take every step necessary to ensure that no community, in Scotland or elsewhere in the world, faces the threat or risk of a similar disaster.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2034</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water&rsquo;s Decision to Sell Rob Roy McGregor&rsquo;s Birthplace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that Scottish Water is set to auction to the highest bidder Glengyle House, where Rob Roy McGregor, the renowned Jacobite and declared outlaw, was born in 1671; notes that this historical building is currently owned by the people of Scotland who have not been consulted on its future, and calls for the house to be withdrawn from the auction which is due to take place on 24 November 2004 to allow a public debate on Glengyle House&rsquo;s future to take place.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2033</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Retire into Action - CSV Report on Older Volunteers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Retire into Action</em>, the Community Service Volunteers&rsquo; research into the benefits of volunteering by older people; celebrates the contribution made by older citizens in supporting local community organisations and individuals in Scotland; notes the personal benefits to be gained by volunteers such as improved health and confidence, as well as great social benefits; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s ageing population provides great opportunities as well as challenges; notes the work done by older citizens in Edinburgh Central in supporting homeless people and those with debt problems, assisting in schools and running community centres and the many community groups that would struggle to exist without the generous time, expertise and commitment given by so many older people, and, in particular, notes the contribution of the Parliament&rsquo;s neighbours in the Old Town where organisations such as the Committee of the St Anne&rsquo;s Community Centre and the committees of the Dumbiedykes Neighbourhood Association and the Writers Group have worked over many years to support people and enrich their lives.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2032</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Energy Jobs for Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to lobby Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government for the transfer of all energy civil service jobs to Aberdeen, Europe&rsquo;s energy capital.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2031</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Winter Cold-Related Deaths</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament finds totally unacceptable the figure of 2,900 winter cold-related deaths in 2003, which is an increase of 400 on the 2002 figure; believes that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s free central heating programme should be expanded and its delivery improved to meet the needs of many who are still living in fuel poverty; recommends that more work is done with the energy companies to encourage them to lower their charges and to ensure they do not disconnect vulnerable, elderly customers, and therefore calls on the Executive to pledge to guarantee that there will be a significant reduction in cold-related deaths in 2004 and no such deaths in 2005.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2030</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Appointment of Condoleezza Rice as US Secretary of State</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its ever-increasing concern at US foreign policy and the danger that it poses to the world; believes that the resignation of Colin Powell and the appointment of Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State signals a ratcheting-up of aggressive imperialist intention and action on the part of the United States of America; believes that millions of people across the world are now in greater danger than they were before the wars on Afghanistan and Iraq; condemns the slaughter of Fallujah; recognises that bombs and blood increase terrorism and that the foreign occupation of Iraq has inevitably led to citizens taking up arms and the further waste of life of women, men and children in Iraq and of members of the armed forces; therefore condemns all acts of barbarism and brutality associated with the occupation; notes documentary evidence of US troops committing war crimes, including the execution of wounded prisoners, and believes that the only hope for a peaceful solution in Iraq is the withdrawal of all foreign occupying forces and that British forces should be brought home immediately, thus avoiding any further casualties.</p>
