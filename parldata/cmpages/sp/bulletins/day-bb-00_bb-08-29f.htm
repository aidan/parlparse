            <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Lewis Offshore</strong>-That the Parliament believes 

            that the proposed public auction on 14 September 2000 of vital oil 

            fabrication equipment belonging to Lewis Offshore at their Arnish 

            yard in the Western Isles amounts to asset-stripping at the expense 

            of the workers employed at the yard and represents a major blow to 

            the economy of the Western Isles; further believes that the proposed 

            sale of these assets makes a nonsense of grants previously awarded 

            to the industry by Highlands and Islands Enterprise and of the £100,000 

            provided for the retraining of staff since the closure of the yard; 

            calls upon the Receivers to cancel the auction, and, pending negotiation 

            of a settlement by public funding, calls for Lewis Offshore to be 

            retained as a public asset for such time in the future when the oil 

            fabrication industry picks up again.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1130</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: 

            Higher Still 2000 Exams</strong>-That the Parliament notes the ongoing 

            problems in providing correct and timely results for the Higher Still 

            2000 exams; further notes that warnings from teachers earlier this 

            year with regard to the underfunding and under-resourcing of the Higher 

            Still courses were ignored, culminating in the exams difficulties 

            at the expense of thousands of students, and believes that the Minister 

            for Children and Education, Mr Sam Galbraith MSP, should resign.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1129#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: 

            Threat to World's Forests</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the industrial 

            logging of the world's ancient forests; notes that most terrestrial 

            bio-diversity resides in forests and that many species are being driven 

            to extinction by the sheer scale of logging which now results in the 

            destruction of 10 million hectares per year, threatening millions 

            of forest dwelling people by this devastation and the climatic changes 

            caused by the ensuing environmental destabilisation; calls upon the 

            leading industrial nations to co-operate and ensure greater information 

            sharing while developing countermeasures to illegal logging; further 

            calls upon governments to assist the International Tropical Timber 

            Organisation in securing market transparency and by implementing and 

            enforcing laws against illegally logged timber and buying timber from 

            certified forests such as those carrying the mark of the Forest Stewardship 

            Council, and believes that governments should deny &quot;aid&quot; 

            funding to projects that destroy ancient forests while providing funds, 

            logistical support and training to help other nations battling to 

            stop illegal logging and produce timber from sustainable forests and 

            their communities.</font></p>
