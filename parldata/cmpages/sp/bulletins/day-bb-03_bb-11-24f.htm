            Work Review</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the shortage 
            of social workers throughout Scotland and considers that the Scottish

            refugees are refused asylum because of poor legal representation and 
            erratic asylum adjudicators, and resolves to oppose any attempt to

            of the debate on Thursday 20 November 2003 on the subject of world 
            peace demonstrated a considered contempt for the Parliament and democratic 
            debate, particularly given the history of Labour in supporting the 
            war in Iraq without a UN mandate specifically authorising such action, 
            and therefore calls on the First Minister to apologise to the Chamber

            Widows and Lloyds TSB</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the decision 
            to transfer Scottish Widows' jobs out of Scotland and believes that 
            none of Lloyds TSB's operations in Scotland should be threatened with 
            either closure or downsizing as a consequence of work being transferred 
            abroad.</P>

            and Borders Safety Camera Partnership in addressing the problems of 
            speeding and serious road crashes and commends the pilot of 20 mph 
            zones utilising flashing road signs outside seven Edinburgh primary 
            schools in making roads safer for children.</P>

            of current legislation in respect of the breeding of animals, in particular 
            domestic pets, and believes that urgent action should be taken to 
            deal with this situation.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-633#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Non-numeric 
            Fingerprinting</strong>-That the Parliament expresses concern at the 
            introduction of non-numeric fingerprinting evidence by the Scottish 
            Criminal Record Office, its implications for the success rate of convictions 
            and the potential consequential increase in the legal aid budget and 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should review this policy on 
            a cross-departmental basis prior to its implementation.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-632#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>North 
            and West Scotland Care Alliance</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the vital role performed by North and West Sutherland Care Alliance

            much-needed relief and assistance to carers and those vulnerable individuals 
            who would otherwise be unable to remain in their own homes and also 
            recognises that equitable and adequate funding of the North and West 
            Sutherland Care Alliance by both NHS Highland and Highland Council 
            is essential.</P>

            Mail for its decision to donate £1 million to London's bid for the

            local post offices in Glasgow, in addition to the 11 already closed 
            since January 2003, and believes that the watchdog body, Postwatch 
            Scotland, should investigate as a matter of urgency whether this decision 
            represents value for money for Royal Mail's customers in Glasgow.</P>

            Assistance) Amendment Regulations 2003</strong>-That the Justice 2 
            Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Scottish

            Services in the West Highlands</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the deep concern of the communities in Fort William and Oban regarding 
            the threat to future provision of acute medical services in the west 
            Highlands; notes that over 3,500 people, so far, have turned out at 
            public meetings to express their opposition to Argyll and Clyde and 
            Highland NHS boards' plans to downgrade Oban and Fort William hospitals 
            to community status; recognises that, if the proposals go ahead, patients 
            from the West Highlands would be forced to travel hundreds of miles 
            to Glasgow or Inverness to access treatment, and therefore believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should reject these plans and give a commitment 
            that the current service provision will continue to be delivered locally 
            to communities in the West Highlands.</P>

            by the Federation of Small Businesses in association with the Scottish 
            Energy Efficiency Office; notes that it is an example of good practice, 
            demonstrating that addressing environmental concerns saves energy 
            and money and reduces the nation's environmental footprint, and recommends 
            the toolkit to all small businesses in Scotland.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Iain Smith</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-626</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>State 
            Visit to Britain by the President of the United States of America</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the inappropriate and insensitive timing of the 
            state visit to Britain by the President of the United States of America, 
            George W Bush; believes, however, that this visit can serve as a reminder 
            of the many military and civilian casualties since the commencement 
            of war in Iraq and the many still suffering in the aftermath; expresses 
            solidarity with the United States citizens who opposed the conflict; 
            notes that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have exacerbated instability 
            worldwide, and calls for an end to such pre-emptive attacks on some 
            of the world's most vulnerable peoples and, instead, encourages engagement 
            with the United Nations to promote peace, equality and an end to world 
            poverty.</P>

            and activities showing the rich heritage of Scotland's music, arts, 
            crafts and food and pays tribute to the local St Andrew's Society

            the closure of Stade nuclear power station as the beginning of the 
            end of nuclear power in Germany and looks forward to the impending 
            closure of Chapelcross nuclear power station in Dumfriesshire as the

            Glasgow City Council on its decision to introduce mandatory 20 mph

            authorities will follow Glasgow City Council's example in trying to 
            improve the safety of pupils travelling to and from school, and views 
            this as a significant and welcome step in implementing the Scottish 
            Executive's commitment to improve Scotland's record on road traffic

            further entrench their domination and develop ever more imaginative 
            schemes to undermine and manipulate the developing nations of the 
            world and further widen the gap between rich and poor, currently concentrating

          <P><strong>S2M-611</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Threat

            Government's Green Paper <em>Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working 
            and Saving for Retirement</em> on teachers' pensions; is opposed to 
            the proposals which would raise the minimum age for taking an occupational 
            pension from 60 to 65 and will have hugely detrimental effects on 
            the future well-being of teachers and their profession; fears that 
            such plans, if implemented, will deter young people from entering 
            the profession with its highly stressful working environment and will 
            force many long-serving teachers to work for five further years beyond 
            their expected retirement date, only serving to disillusion and dishearten 
            them, given that half the secondary teaching workforce is within 12 
            years of retirement; believes that these proposals will make it extremely 
            difficult to recruit new teachers, and therefore supports the Scottish 
            School Teachers' Association's campaign to have the proposals overturned.</P>

            which could be improved to help to give customer choice as well as 
            protecting post offices; very much regrets, however, the response 
            of Her Majesty's Government which ignores the great majority of the 
            recommendations, and urges the Scottish Executive to encourage Her 
            Majesty's Government to pursue the implementation of the report in
