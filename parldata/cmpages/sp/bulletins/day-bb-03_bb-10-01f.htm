            of the Regions</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes the loss of

            McGugan, Christine May and Hugh Halcro-Johnston; thanks these individuals 
            for the contribution they have made to representing Scotland in the 
            European Union, and endorses the proposal to nominate Mr Jack McConnell 
            MSP, Nicol Stephen MSP, Councillor Corrie McChord and Councillor Keith 
            Brown as full members and Irene Oldfather MSP, Nicola Sturgeon MSP,

          <p><strong>*S2M-437#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Rising 
            Crime in Forth Valley</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes that 
            the number of recorded crimes and offences in Forth Valley increased 
            again in 2002-03, despite the local constabulary&#8217;s enviable 
            record of detecting and clearing up crime; recognises that a secure 
            society can only be built on a foundation of public order and that 
            this requires public policy to focus on cutting crime, reducing the 
            risk of re-offending and keeping young people off the conveyor belt 
            to crime, and believes that the Scottish Executive should begin by 
            supporting the local police force with additional resources for a 
            more visible presence on the streets, ensuring honesty in sentencing 
            of convicted criminals by removing automatic remission and providing 
            more flexible funding arrangements to local authorities when asking 
            them to tackle the problems of crime and anti-social behaviour.</p>

            recognises the valuable work of the former Health and Community Care 
            Committee in its report on hepatitis C (17th Report 2001) and its 
            seven recommendations; notes that the scheme proposed by the Minister 
            for Health and Community Care with a package worth in the region of 
            &#163;15 million falls far short of the recommendations of the independent 
            inquiry team chaired by Lord Ross where payments would have totalled 
            some &#163;89 million; further notes that the inquiry team&#39;s figure 
            is still well below settlements elsewhere in the world; considers 
            that the Scottish Executive&#39;s offer will be perceived as being 
            hurtful, mean, unjust and insulting; notes that there are substantial 
            unresolved issues regarding the probable prescribing of known infected 
            blood products until as late as the mid 1990s; further notes that 
            there are issues surrounding the effectiveness of the subsequent prescribing 
            of &quot;synthetic&quot; Factor 8 products, and considers that the 
            Executive should review its offer to comply with the recommendations 
            of Lord Ross&#39;s inquiry and instigate a public inquiry now.</p>

            of planning applications for onshore wind farms throughout Scotland; 
            is further concerned, whilst supporting renewable energy, about the 
            environmental and landscape impact of wind farms and understands that 
            these frequently face vigorous local opposition; believes that the 
            current planning regime provides inadequate guidance to local authorities, 
            communities and developers in relation to the siting of wind farms; 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should bring forward as a matter 
            of urgency new planning guidance on the siting of wind farms taking 
            proper account of these factors, and further considers that the Executive 
            should declare a moratorium on the determination of locally-opposed 
            wind farm planning applications until such guidance has taken effect.</p>
