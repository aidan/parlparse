          <p>9.30 am&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate on Juvenile 
            Justice-</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2205</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Juvenile Justice</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises that the Children's Hearings system as at 
            present constituted is manifestly failing to deal with criminal and 
            offending behaviour and calls upon the Executive to carry out a full 
            review of Scotland's system of juvenile justice, such a review to 
            include consideration of giving Children's Hearings an increased range 
            of disposals. </p>
       
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-2205.2</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen: Juvenile Justice</strong>-As an 
                amendment to motion (S1M-2205) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave 
                out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;confirms 
                its support for the principles of the hearings system in dealing 
                with children who are at risk whether through offending or anti-social 
                behaviour or are in need of care and protection; considers that 
                the children's hearings system provides the best framework within 
                which to identify the needs of vulnerable children and young people 
                and to determine the most appropriate response; praises the commitment 
                and skill of the volunteers who are appointed as members of Children's 
                Panels and Children's Panel Advisory Committees; welcomes the 
                consensus achieved by the Advisory Group on Youth Crime and confirms 
                its support for the Group's recommendations for reducing and stopping 
                youth crime; further welcomes the increased expenditure by the 
                Executive on children's services and Youth Crime Review to support 
                targeted services in local authorities; supports the Executive 
                in its drive to reduce re-offending rates among children and young 
                people, as set out in Working Together for Scotland, as this will 
                benefit communities, victims and young people, and encourages 
                local authorities, service providers and other partners to develop 
                programmes and services which seek to address the offending behaviour 
                and underlying contributory factors in the lives of young people 
                who offend.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S1M-2205.1</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Juvenile Justice</strong>-As 
                an amendment to motion (S1M-2205) in the name of Bill Aitken, 
                leave out from &quot;as&quot; to end and insert &quot;has served 
                society and Scotland's children and families very well and that 
                it will continue to do so in the future, provided that adequate 
                and effective resources are applied to the system to help young 
                people who offend, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring 
                forward without further delay the national strategy and framework 
                arising from the youth crime review in order to set out national 
                programmes for effectively working with young people to prevent 
                crime, ensure that measures are in place to support those at risk 
                of offending and recommend proven intervention strategies for 
                offenders. </p>
            <p><i>followed by</i>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate 
            on Improving Patient Care- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2207</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Improving Patient Care</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the opening of the new hospitals built thanks 
            to the PFI programme initiated by the last Conservative governments 
            but notes with grave concern that the delivery of health care in Scotland 
            has fallen far short of the standards people expect, with local hospital 
            services under threat and patients waiting longer for treatment and 
            facing the prospect of being forced to go abroad to get the treatment 
            they need in a reasonable time; calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to extend the principle of partnership with the independent sector 
            to the delivery of health care and begin discussions with the independent 
            sector with a view to signing a &quot;concordat&quot; in similar terms 
            to that already established in England, and further calls upon the 
            Executive to initiate a debate in Scotland about how to improve standards 
            of health care to the levels of the best European countries without 
            raising taxes to unacceptable levels and whilst ensuring that access 
            to high quality care is guaranteed for all. </p>
    
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2207.2</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon: Improving Patient Care</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S1M-2207) in the name of David McLetchie, 
            leave out from &quot;built&quot; to end and insert &quot;, notes the 
            progress that has already been made across Scotland in improving services 
            for patients and believes that continued implementation of <i>Our 
            National Health: a plan for action, a plan for change</i> will deliver 
            increasing benefits for patients, with the objective of high quality 
            care for all.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2207.1</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Improving Patient Care</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S1M-2207) in the name of David McLetchie, 
            leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes 
            that, as a result of successive government policies, Scotland has 
            become the PFI capital of Europe and that PFI is the most expensive 
            method of financing hospital building; further notes that the privatisation 
            of domestic services in hospitals presided over by the last Conservative 
            government has resulted in a deterioration of standards of cleanliness 
            in hospitals and record levels of hospital-acquired infections; believes 
            that further private involvement in the delivery of health services 
            is not in the interests of patients, and is committed to rebuilding 
            a public health service in Scotland that is capable of delivering 
            the highest quality of care for all our citizens.&quot; </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2236</strong> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Effective Assessment 
            in Scotland's Schools</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance 
            of effective assessment in schools as a means of improving learning 
            and achievement and supports the Executive's plans to create a coherent 
            system of assessment for Scotland; further recognises that the best 
            way to achieve this is by (a) ensuring that the monitoring and reporting 
            of pupils' progress is done in a consistent way throughout the school 
            years; (b) supporting teachers to make sound judgements about pupils' 
            learning and parents to be involved with their children's development; 
            (c) improving national monitoring of achievement in key areas, and 
            (d) bringing together diverse approaches to record-keeping and reporting 
            in a single, integrated framework, and supports the Executive's plans 
            to involve stakeholders in carrying forward these proposals and to 
            introduce a simpler, more streamlined approach which is effective 
            and easier for teachers, parents and pupils to understand. </p>
