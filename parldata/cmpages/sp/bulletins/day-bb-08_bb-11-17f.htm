<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2899</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Cumbernauld: A Love Song</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Carolyn McGoldrick, who recently wrote, produced and released her debut single and music video entitled Cumbernauld: A Love Song, supported by a &pound;2,000 cultural grant from North Lanarkshire Council; notes that the song portrays the positive experiences of growing up in the new town, and also notes that all proceeds from sales of the single will be donated to the charity CLIC Sargent, a charity that cares for children and young people with cancer, and that the single can be purchased via the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cdfreedom.com/artists/carolynmcgoldrick/catalog/cumbernauldalovesong/" target="_blank">www.cdfreedom.com/artists/carolynmcgoldrick/catalog/cumbernauldalovesong/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2898&diams; </strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Recognising the Role of a Healthy, Competitive Television Industry in the Cultural Life of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the contribution made to the cultural and social life of Scotland and, in particular, in Glasgow and Edinburgh, by a vibrant and competitive home-based television programme-making sector; recognises the role of STV as Scotland&rsquo;s only commercial public sector broadcasting (PSB) provider, a function that it has provided for 50 years; supports Ofcom&rsquo;s enhanced evolution option, with STV continuing to provide PSB for Scotland as part of a wider UK network; rejects ITV plc&rsquo;s call for a single UK-wide brand, which would not be in the interests of Scotland; supports STV&rsquo;s bid to continue to be a PSB licence holder for Scotland, and, recognising that the company is outside the ITV commissioning process, supports STV&rsquo;s request to be awarded independent producer status, making it easier for other channels to commission programme production from Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2897</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Reverend William Hewitt and to Kilmarnock Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Reverend William Hewitt on his election as Moderator Designate of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland; welcomes the intention of Reverend Hewitt to focus on cooperation between churches during his time in the role of moderator; further notes that Reverend Hewitt was educated at Kilmarnock Academy, and records its congratulations to Kilmarnock Academy on its remarkable record of former pupils of the school filling this important post three times in the last decade, with former moderators, Andrew McLellan and John Miller, postholders in 2000 and 2001 respectively, also being former pupils of the academy.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2849</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Treating Lone Parents as Unemployed - Planned Changes to Benefits</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the UK Government&rsquo;s plans to require lone parents, from 24 November 2008 for those with a youngest child of 12 years old, from 26 October 2009 for those with a youngest child of 10 years old and from 25 October 2010 for those with a youngest child of seven years old, to be available for work, claim jobseekers allowance and be subject to consequential benefit sanctions and considers that these measures seriously undervalue the unpaid work of raising children, treating the raising of children as the equivalent of being unemployed.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2844.1</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Renfrewshire Nursery School Cuts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2844) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the further development of nursery education within Renfrewshire, including more equitable allocation of teacher resources across local authority and partner pre-five provision, increasing teacher access from 82% to 100% for pre-five children, and also welcomes the increase of 25 nursery officers resulting in an overall increase in the provision of pre-five educators within Renfrewshire&quot;.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn, Sandra White</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2529#</strong> <strong>James Kelly:</strong> <strong>Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society - Get it on Time Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society on its award-winning Get it on Time campaign highlighting the problems faced by people with Parkinson&rsquo;s in hospital, with materials aimed at patients, health professionals and NHS managers; notes that there are about 10,000 people with Parkinson&rsquo;s in Scotland, including in Rutherglen and Cambuslang, and that more than a quarter of them will be admitted to hospital at least once each year; is concerned that many people with Parkinson&rsquo;s are unable to follow their medication regime in hospital; recognises that if people with Parkinson&rsquo;s do not get their medication on time they can suffer serious and distressing problems, including being unable to move, speak or swallow and that extended hospital stays are needed to restore effective symptom control; believes that many of the barriers to receiving medication on time can be addressed through straightforward measures, including policies enabling people who wish to self-medicate to do so, involvement from a Parkinson&rsquo;s disease nurse specialist or pharmacist on admission, education for hospital staff, listening to people with Parkinson&rsquo;s, their carers and families and wider availability of anti-Parkinsonian drugs in hospital pharmacies, and believes that measures should be taken to ensure that people with Parkinson&rsquo;s get their medication on time, every time.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2374#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Gaelic Language Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, along with other local authorities and public bodies, for the recent publication of their Gaelic language plans; likewise commends the Gaelic plan of the Scottish Parliament and the soon to be published Gaelic language plan of the Scottish Government; notes the important work done by the community and by many agencies and bodies in Scotland to maintain and develop the Gaelic language; recognises that in the coming few years it will become clear whether or not Gaelic is to survive as a community language, and therefore recognises that a sense of urgency in this area of policy is essential, particularly in respect of the expansion of Gaelic medium education, if we are to ensure that the number of speakers has, by the 2021 census, been stabilised at 2001 levels as the prerequisite for long term growth.</p>
