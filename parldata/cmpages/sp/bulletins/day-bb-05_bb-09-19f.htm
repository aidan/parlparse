          <p><strong> * S2M-3292 Alex Johnstone:Lumphanan&rsquo;s Macbeth Day&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the community of Lumphanan for holding a Macbeth Day on 17 September 2005 to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of the birth of Macbeth, King of Scots from 1040 to 1057; appreciates that well-organised entertaining and educational events such as this will demonstrate to Scots the truth about Macbeth&rsquo;s reign and help dispel the unfortunate myths surrounding the king generated mainly by Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scottish Play&rdquo;, and calls for more work to be done to highlight Macbeth&rsquo;s place in a successful and forward-looking 11th century Scotland.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-3291 Dr Jean Turner:Scotland Awarded First Geopark by UNESCO&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the official recognition by UNESCO of Scotland&rsquo;s first-ever geopark, which is located north of Ullapool and reaches to Cape Wrath and Loch Eriboll; notes that this area of historic, remarkable and outstanding beauty also is the location of the Old Man of Stoer and Smoo Cave and contains Lewis gneiss, which is 3,000 million years old and Europe&rsquo;s oldest rock, and further notes that the North West Highlands Geopark is the first area in Scotland to win the European accolade. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-3290 Tommy Sheridan:Disingenuous Liberal Democrats&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament regrets the inability of the Liberal Democrat Group to provide a member to participate in the detailed scrutiny of the Council Tax Abolition and Service Tax Introduction (Scotland) Bill during either of the two Local Government and Transport Committee meetings at which the Bill was considered and believes that, in light of the Liberal Democrats&rsquo; widely trailed concern over the fairness of council tax, their failure to send a member or their substitute to the committee exposes the disingenuous nature of their concern and demonstrates that they have no intention of voting to abolish the council tax if it compromises their position in the coalition, which they will always prioritise over the interests of millions of pensioners and low-paid workers hammered by the unfair Tory tax.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-3289 # Margaret Mitchell:Barnardo&rsquo;s Freagarrach Project - 10th Anniversary&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the Barnardo&rsquo;s Freagarrach project in Falkirk on its 10th anniversary; commends the work it conducts which aims to reduce, and ultimately stop, the offending behaviour of young people aged 12 to 18 who are at risk of being removed from their communities due to the frequency or severity of their offending; applauds its outstanding record in 2003-04 which resulted in a reduction in re-offending by an average of 81% between the 12 to 16-year-old service and the 16 to 18-year-old service, and believes that the Scottish Executive should encourage more local authorities to support such projects.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-3288 Mr Brian Monteith:Stop the Pigeon&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the decision of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) to deal with the ongoing problem of pigeon guano affecting the Holyrood complex; notes that the problem of pigeons extends to birds entering MSPs&rsquo; offices through the natural ventilation system resulting in some windows being closed and temperatures rising; considers that Billy Connolly&rsquo;s description of the MSP office block as a &ldquo;doo-cot&rdquo; is becoming all too accurate; understands the need to take action to counter any potential health risks from pigeon waste; believes that traditional methods may be both cheaper, less visually distracting and more effective in dealing with the problems of pigeons than the netting proposed by the SPCB, and calls on the SPCB to investigate the use of a hawker to scare pigeons away from the buildings.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-3287 Mark Ballard:Possible Acquisition of More Polar Bears by Edinburgh Zoo&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern that Edinburgh Zoo is giving serious consideration to acquiring more polar bears despite the Zoo&rsquo;s assurance in 2003 that it would stop keeping this species when its current polar bear, Mercedes, dies; notes that Mercedes is the last polar bear kept in a UK zoo and that she displays signs of distress and abnormal behaviour such as repetitive pacing and swimming; further notes that it is widely accepted that polar bears&rsquo; needs can never be properly met in captivity; believes that captive breeding in zoos is not a realistic approach to the conservation of polar bears as it is considered to be extremely difficult to successfully re-introduce such creatures into the wild, and calls on the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland not to acquire any new polar bears for keeping at Edinburgh Zoo.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-3286 Brian Adam on behalf of the Standards and Public Appointments Committee:6th Report, 2005 (Session 2) of the Standards and Public Appointments Committee, Draft Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies in Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees that the Standards and Public Appointments Committee&rsquo;s 6th Report, 2005 (Session 2): <em>Draft Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies in Scotland</em> (SP Paper 410), together with the <em>Official Report</em> of the Parliament&rsquo;s debate on the report, should form the Parliament&rsquo;s response to the consultation by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland. </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-3285 Mr Kenny MacAskill:An Impartial Service?&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern the implications of the opening of National Archives of Scotland file, SEP 10/556, for the perception of an impartial civil service; notes that for 30 years the British state concealed a report by Professor Gavin McCrone that strongly supported the economic case for independence, and calls for an assurance from the Scottish Executive that it has never used the civil service to try&nbsp;and undermine any political party or movement in the partisan way that the Scottish Office and Cabinet Office used the civil service to try and undermine the Scottish National Party in 1975.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-3284 Roseanna Cunningham:A Warneing to England&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the England cricket side on their success in regaining the Ashes from Australia; notes that Australian generosity will not begrudge them a win once in 18 years, but expresses every confidence that Australia will regain the Ashes at the next meeting between the two countries.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-3283 Mr Jamie McGrigor:Christine&rsquo;s Wide Ball&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the comments of Christine Grahame MSP that cricket is a sport of &ldquo;only marginal interest in Scotland&rdquo;; believes that her comments ignore the facts that cricket is celebrating the 220th anniversary of the first-recorded match in Scotland in 1785, that there are an estimated 12,000 active cricketers of all ages in Scotland, that a sell-out crowd of 4,500 paid to see Scotland play Australia earlier this summer and that it is estimated that three times that number could have packed the Grange in Edinburgh had there been capacity for them and that the BBC considered interest in the match to be sufficient to show the game live, that eight of the 20 players from the smaller countries which qualified for the ICC World Cup invited to a pre-World Cup training camp are Scottish and three are Scots-born Asians, and celebrates Scottish cricket&rsquo;s proud record in helping people from across the world integrate into their local communities in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-3282 # Bill Butler :Drumchapel High School Pupils&rsquo; Support for the Vucaj Family&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament expresses its admiration for the pupils of Drumchapel High School in Glasgow who have organised a petition which has already attracted hundreds of signatures in support of their friends and fellow pupils, Nimet, aged 16, and Saida Vucaj, aged 13, who were taken from their home in Scotstoun at 7.00 am on Tuesday 13 September 2005 following the rejection of their family&rsquo;s asylum application; conveys concern at the apparently heavy-handed nature of the family&rsquo;s eviction which saw Elvis Vucaj handcuffed by one of several immigration officials drafted in to extract the family from their home and the youngest child, Saida Vucaj, removed in her pyjamas; hopes that the pupils&rsquo; petition will play an important part in attempting to convince the Home Office to grant the family a stay of removal pending a case review; agrees that these acts of solidarity and support, including staff members at Drumchapel High School writing to Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary, in support of the Vucaj family&rsquo;s case, not only exemplify the goodwill which exists towards asylum seekers in Scotland but also demonstrate the philosophy behind the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Scotland, Many Cultures&rdquo; campaign, and considers that the pupils should be congratulated for their stance.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-3281 Dr Jean Turner:Scottish Medicines Consortium - Breast Cancer Drug, Arimidex, Approved Ahead of the Rest of the United Kingdom&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) for backing, ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom, the use in Scotland of the breast cancer drug, anastrazole (Arimidex) for first-line therapy in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive early invasive breast cancer; notes that in trials this drug cut the risk of cancer returning in older woman to less than one in four, and further notes that the backing is ahead of the appraisal by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) who may not be appraising this drug until November 2006 due to funding cuts of &pound;3.5 million. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-3279 Dr Jean Turner:NHS Greater Glasgow - Bed Review Consultation Time Should Be Longer&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament urges NHS Greater Glasgow to reconsider the consultation period for the future of acute in-patient beds in greater Glasgow; notes that the bed-modelling document was only made public at a NHS Greater Glasgow board meeting on 26 July 2005, with views and comments to be received by mid-September 2005; further notes that a consultation of this magnitude needs more that seven weeks, especially given that the consultation started during the summer, and believes that NHS Greater Glasgow&rsquo;s own statement that &ldquo;d eveloping proposals for service redesign and the related requirement for in-patient beds for a decade in advance is a difficult and challenging endeavour&rdquo; should reinforce the call for a longer consultation period so that all interested parties and members of the public should be able to have their views considered. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-3276 Tommy Sheridan:Support for North Action Group and the Retention of Full Maternity Services at Caithness General Hospital&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the North Action Group for its persistent and untiring campaigning to retain full maternity and gynaecology cover in Wick, with 24/7 consultant cover; is concerned that the long-term future of these services has still not been secured; is further concerned that the impact of a loss of consultant services will lead to an unacceptable increase in the numbers of women unable to give birth near their homes and families and an increase in high-risk transfers of mums and babies and that the issue of travelling time and its consequences for outcome has not been reconciled by NHS Highland, and believes that nothing less than full consultant cover will ensure the health and well-being of all women and babies in Caithness and equality of access to maternity services.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-3274 Christine Grahame:It&rsquo;s Simply Not Cricket&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the recent cricket win by England over Australia and, while congratulating England&rsquo;s players, laments the overwhelming UK-wide coverage of a sport that is of only marginal interest in Scotland and further laments that England&rsquo;s win is apparently of more importance than the continuing starvation of millions in Niger, the complete failure of the UK Government to deliver on the G8 promises and the continuing chaos in Iraq and Afghanistan, and notes that it provides a timely diversion from these desperate failures of the UK Government but that many of us are keeping our eye on another ball. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-3251 Mr Brian Monteith:Free Use of MECS&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the decision of Stirling Council to introduce an annual charge of &pound;52 for use of the Mobile Emergency Care System (MECS); believes that the charge is a significant cost for many vulnerable pensioners; further believes that the charge makes a mockery of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s much-vaunted claims of free personal care for the elderly, and calls on Stirling Council to remove the charge with immediate effect to ensure that this valuable service is available free to some of the Stirling community&rsquo;s most vulnerable people.</p>
