    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-627</b> <strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: The Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border
    Public Authorities) (Adaptation of Functions etc.) Order 2000</strong>&#151;That the Education,
    Culture and Sport Committee in consideration of The Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public
    Authorities) (Adaptation of Functions etc.) Order 2000 recommends that the order be
    approved. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-626#</b> <strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing: Glenrinnes School Closure</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the importance of primary schools to our rural communities; asks
    for clarification of the Scottish Executive&#146;s policy on the retention of such
    schools; is concerned that Glenrinnes school is threatened by closure despite being the
    only focal point in the village and despite the sound educational arguments proposed by
    parents and prospective local residents; and considers that the proposals by Moray Council
    to close this educational facility, which would accrue only £3,500 to Moray Council,
    should be rejected.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Dr Winnie Ewing<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-625#</b> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Reduction in the TV Licence Fee for
    Deaf and Hearing Impaired People</strong>&#151;That the Parliament note that visually impaired
    viewers are entitled to a 50% reduction in their television licenses; notes also that deaf
    and hearing impaired people cannot fully enjoy television broadcasts despite the welcome
    service of subtitling, and believes that deaf and hearing impaired people should also be
    entitled to a reduction in the cost of their television licenses.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-624</b> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Pinochet Case</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament regrets the decision of the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, not to extradite
    General Augusto Pinochet to Spain in relation to torture and murder in Chile under his
    dictatorship and believes that this constitutes a serious setback for the enforcement of
    the rule of international law and human rights.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong>, Michael Russell<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-623</b> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: Ethical Standards in Public Life Bill
    etc. (Scotland) Bill - Finance- </strong>&#151;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act
    of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc.
    (Scotland) Bill, agrees to the expenditure payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund
    of the expenses of the Scottish Ministers in the consequence of the Act.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-622</b> <strong>Hugh Henry: Bank Charges</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    notes with concern the decision of the Link Group to support Barclays Bank&#146;s
    proposals to make a charge for withdrawals at cash machines; expresses concern that this
    will have a disproportionate adverse affect on lower income users, and supports the three
    Scottish banks who are committed to providing the service free of charge.</p>
