<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">current motions</a> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6318 Duncan McNeil on behalf of the Local Government and Communities Committee: Report on Local Government Finance&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Local Government and Communities Committee&rsquo;s 2nd report 2010 (Session 3): <em>Report on Local Government Finance Inquiry </em>(SP Paper 377).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6317 Claire Baker: Glenrothes Teenagers Nominated for Brave@Heart Award&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates Glenrothes teenagers Riah Holland and Kirsten Elder who have been nominated for a Brave@Heart Award by Fife police after their courage helped save a life; recognises that the 15-year-olds came to the aid of a woman who was in distress; commends Riah and Kirsten for their quick thinking and bravery in the face of a frightening situation; recognises that the girls were also honoured at Fife Constabulary&rsquo;s Unsung Heroes award ceremony in the Glen Pavilion in September 2009, and wishes Riah and Kirsten well for the Brave@Heart Awards at Edinburgh Castle in June 2010.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6316 Joe FitzPatrick: Fiscal Stimulus&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees that protecting the economic recovery is a key priority for Scotland; believes that the importance of maintaining a fiscal stimulus cannot be underestimated; further believes that such a stimulus would be a key tool in helping to cement the recovery and create jobs, and calls on the UK Government to respond positively to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s call for a sustained fiscal stimulus for Scotland and the UK.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6315 Kenneth Gibson: Olympic Games Consequentials&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament believes that the clear principles upon which the framework for funding the devolved administrations in the United Kingdom is based have not always been satisfactorily applied; further believes that the Barnett consequentials resulting from the regeneration spending associated with the 2012 Olympics are an example of this, and calls on the UK Government to release the Barnett consequentials due from the Olympics to the Scottish Government, Welsh Assembly Government and Northern Irish Executive at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6314 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Access to Fossil Fuel Levy Surplus&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament believes that the &pound;185 million Scottish fossil fuel levy surplus has the potential to support investment in Scotland&rsquo;s growing renewables industry and assist Scotland&rsquo;s response to the challenges presented by climate change; regrets that the Scottish Government has not hitherto been given access to these funds, and calls on the UK Government to release the fossil fuel levy to Scotland at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6313 Bill Wilson: Taxpayer-owned Banks Should Not be Destroying the Environment and People&rsquo;s Lives&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Lloyds Banking Group&rsquo;s chief executive to waive his bonus for 2009 but deplores its remuneration committee&rsquo;s decision to make this award and the support offered to Lloyds&rsquo; remuneration proposals by UK Financial Investments; considers that there is abundant evidence that very high pay is no guarantee of good performance but that it is associated with inequality and therefore with poor health, short lives, unhappiness and crime; further notes the reported involvement of UK banks in supporting what are considered environmentally and ethically dubious projects such as the exploitation of the Alberta tar sands; urges the UK Government to change the criteria by which UK Financial Investments operates, such as to compel it to consider human rights, environmental criteria and the long-term wellbeing of the people of this country and elsewhere rather than encouraging the taxpayer-owned banks to chase short-term profits at the expense of such things, and believes that the banks should remain in public ownership if this would be the best way of preventing destructive investment policies.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6312# Liam McArthur: Penalties on Farmers&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament considers that the tightening of enforcement of cross-compliance rules for farmers, particularly in the Highlands and Islands and elsewhere in Scotland, has resulted in new and higher levels of penalties due to unintentional errors in livestock paperwork and a new interpretation of land eligibility rules governing claims for Single Farm Payment (SFP) or Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS); considers it unsatisfactory that many farmers and crofters have been left uncertain of how to properly fill out their 2010 application forms for SFP and LFASS in time for the 17 May 2010 deadline because of a lack of clarity in the new interpretation of the land eligibility rules; believes that there is a manifest injustice when anyone is penalised where the interpretation of rules have been changed without proper notice and explanation, and supports the call from NFU Scotland for the introduction of an immediate amnesty on penalties associated with eligibility of land for support scheme purposes and for moves to reduce the impact on farmers and crofters of the tighter interpretation of the rules.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-6303</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Will Danny Deliver?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the potential opportunities for the Highlands in the appointment of the Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey MP, Danny Alexander, as the Secretary of State for Scotland in the newly formed Conservative/Liberal Democrat government; notes the many statements from Mr Alexander since he was first elected as a Highlands MP, including demanding cancellation of Highland Council&rsquo;s housing debt and lowering the rate of fuel duty for rural areas, that could now be implemented utilising his new-found power as the UK Government&rsquo;s representative for Scotland on reserved matters; looks forward to his quick action on these and the many other issues that he criticised the previous UK Government for not dealing with in statements made in the House of Commons, in the Liberal Democrat manifesto and across the Highlands; considers that he should immediately seek to meet the key Liberal Democrat campaign pledges to provide greater fiscal autonomy to Scotland, implement the recommendations of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution on which all political parties have agreed, and ultimately abolish the Scotland Office altogether, which will save taxpayers &pound;10 million annually.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-6302</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Democratic Choice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns what it believes to be the bizarre and anti-democratic comments reported by newly elected Labour MP Margaret Curran MSP in <em>The Herald</em> on 12 May 2010 when her statement implied that the SNP should not stand candidates against Labour although Labour should be able to field candidates against the SNP; considers that Ms Curran&rsquo;s reported suggestion that the SNP is somehow responsible for the creation of the Conservative/Liberal Democrat UK government by standing candidates in the same seats as the Labour Party is wholly inaccurate, undemocratic and against the right of people to vote for whom they wish; believes that if the SNP had not stood candidates in constituencies such as Banff and Buchan, Perth and Perthshire North, Moray and Angus then the number of seats won by the Conservative Party would have been even greater; also considers it arrogant to assume that if the SNP had not stood candidates in these constituencies that votes would automatically have gone to the Labour Party, and believes that Labour lost power because of its dismal failure in England, caused by years of economic mismanagement.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6299&diams; </strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Employment and Support Allowance, Unfit for Purpose</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the workings of the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA); notes evidence from the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) Service in Scotland that uncovers serious hardship experienced by ESA claimants across Scotland; considers that sickness benefits should support people in finding employment if they are able to work, but must also provide help for those who are not; considers that ESA is failing to find this balance and is putting pressure on sick and disabled people in Scotland; notes in particular, claims that the work capability assessment of ESA is making unsuitable decisions on claimants&rsquo; fitness for work and that 70% of CAB appeals against these decisions are being upheld, and resolves that ESA be urgently reviewed so that it can be made to work in the interests of the genuinely sick and disabled people of Central Scotland and the rest of the country.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6298</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Changes to the Provision and Delivery of Care for Children with Cystic Fibrosis in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the closure of Ward 6B of Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow, which accommodated young people with cystic fibrosis; acknowledges that the nursing staff of the ward have been dispersed across other wards in the hospital, which will result in patients with cystic fibrosis being admitted to alternative accommodation and possibly being nursed by staff with little or no knowledge of cystic fibrosis; understands that it is vital for those providing care for people with cystic fibrosis to have an in-depth understanding of the condition and to comprehend the importance of segregation of this group of patients and the necessary steps to take to avoid cross-infection; is further concerned at changes to the role of cystic fibrosis specialist nurses who are reportedly being directed to spend 20% of their time undertaking ward duties in Yorkhill Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh; considers that, as a result of this directive, the ability of specialist nurses to provide a comprehensive package of care will be compromised and that the current situation falls below the UK and European standards of care for those with cystic fibrosis.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5636#</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Family Nurse Partnership Programme in Lothian</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates NHS Lothian on being selected by the Scottish Government as a test site, fully funded for three years, for a Family Nurse Partnership programme, an intensive preventive programme for vulnerable first-time young parents that has a 30-year evidence base showing the potential for improvements in women&rsquo;s ante-natal health, reductions in children&rsquo;s injuries, greater intervals between births, increases in fathers&rsquo; involvement, increases in employment and earnings, reductions in the need for benefits, improvements in school readiness, reduced arrests and criminal behaviour in 15-year-olds and mothers and that eventually produces savings five times the amount of an initial investment; realises that one measure alone is not the entire answer to challenges in this field but a welcome start, and wishes the project every success.</p>
