            unacceptably low level; regrets and deplores the Executive's continued 
            lack of investment in rural transport and information technology infrastructure 
            and the over-regulation which has resulted in barriers to the regeneration 
            of the rural economy, and calls on the Executive to devolve decision-making 
            powers to a local level while reversing policies which are damaging 
            to rural communities in Scotland. </p>

                that a strong economy provides the foundation for meeting social 
                justice objectives in respect of increasing opportunities for 
                all, first-class public services and infrastructure, and further

            Parliament recognises that increased investment in transport infrastructure 
            is essential to providing the best business environment to generate 
            growth and investment in Scotland; regrets that since Labour came 
            to power in Scotland in 1997 there has been a failure to deliver any 
            meaningful infrastructure or public transport improvements; further 
            regrets that the Scottish Executive continues to prefer spin and wish-lists 
            to costed plans and timescales for delivery, and calls on the Executive 
            to provide full details, including the cost and timetable, for completion 
            of each commitment outlined in the recent Spending Review which included 
            the Scottish Passenger Rail Franchise, rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh
