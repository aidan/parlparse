<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00359 Liam McArthur: Orphir School Success in STEM Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of four 9 and 10-year old pupils, Tia Whitton, Mia McIver, Harry Baird and Joe Sinclair, from Orphir Community School in Orkney, in the annual celebration of engineering and science event held at the Glasgow Science Centre on 10 June 2011; notes that the pupils won the national Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths (STEM) challenge award for primary schools; further notes that, in order to win, the pupils undertook a series of STEM challenges and gave a presentation on the eco-friendly coconut cutter that their class had designed in order to save lives and promote coconut production in the Kerala region of India; congratulates the pupils on their success; notes that they were from one of the smallest schools taking part, that the pupils were the youngest competitors and that their team was one of smallest; also congratulates all the other winners and competitors in the event, and considers that this shows that young Orcadians and other young Scots have the skills needed to secure Scotland&rsquo;s future place at the cutting edge of science and engineering on which, it believes, the future prosperity of the nation depends.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00358 Patricia Ferguson: Cadder Gala Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the Cadder Community Festival group for organising what it considers a successful Cadder Gala Day on 18 June 2011; recognises the contribution of everyone who played their part on the day to make it such an enjoyable community event, and believes that this annual event offers an excellent opportunity for local people to become involved in the Cadder community.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00357 Kenny MacAskill: Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Roseanna Cunningham*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00356 Mary Fee: Crisis at Quarriers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave concern regarding the situation at Quarriers where it understands that staff are facing pay cuts of 25% due to reductions in funding for social care across Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities; notes that Quarriers has issued all of its staff with 90-day redundancy notices and understands that if the staff do not accept these pay cuts and changes to their terms and conditions of service, their contracts will be terminated; considers that the needs of the 10,000 service users, some of whom are the most vulnerable in society, should be paramount; believes that quality and continuity of care are of the utmost importance, requiring staff to be appropriately trained and resourced; further notes that Quarriers is not alone and that other voluntary organisations are facing similar challenges, and calls on the Scottish Government to hold an urgent summit to address what is considered the growing crisis in the provision of social care.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00355 Margaret Mitchell: Bothwell Community Garden</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Organic Growers of Bothwell on the official opening of its Bothwell Community Garden, a sustainable garden growing fruit, vegetables and herbs organically, which is committed to the promotion of biodiversity; notes that the garden has been developed on disused land and was funded by a Climate Change Fund grant; further notes that the garden has 62 raised beds, six of which have been narrowed to provide easy access and another six of which have been specially lowered so that they can be used by local schools and nurseries; acknowledges the efforts of the Organic Growers of Bothwell, which has been planning the garden since 2009 and began to sow and grow its own vegetables in the garden in May 2010; understands that its members are now enjoying improved health and wellbeing from walking to the garden and eating more vegetables; recognises that the garden is encouraging local residents to grow their own vegetables and to use their food waste to help compost the garden rather than using landfill sites, thereby making a contribution to tackling climate change; considers that the garden is a valuable asset to the various sectors of the community of Bothwell and a superb example of what can be achieved through community cooperation, and hopes that the garden can serve as a replicable model for community gardens across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00354 Patricia Ferguson: Good Luck to the British Special Olympics Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the Special Olympics, an international organisation founded by Eunice Kennedy Shriver in 1968 for adults and young people with learning disabilities; extends its support to the Great Britain Special Olympics Team as it sets out to participate in this year&rsquo;s Special Olympics World Summer Games, the biggest worldwide sporting event of 2011, to be held in Athens from 25 June to 4 July; welcomes the fact that over half of the athletes in the GB team are drawn from Scotland; looks forward to the GB team building on its record of success at the previous summer games held in Warsaw in 2010, where 88 medals were won, and sends its good wishes to all participants regardless of country.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00337.1 Sarah Boyack: Edinburgh International City of Learning</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-000337 in the name of Marco Biagi (Edinburgh International City of Learning), insert at end &quot;; considers that, if Edinburgh is to be an international city of learning, the provision of nurseries, schools and employment for teachers must be a top priority and therefore regrets the recent decision by the SNP/Liberal Democrat-led City of Edinburgh Council to close the High School Yards and Princess Elizabeth nursery schools; expresses further regret that these closures will go ahead despite being called in by the Scottish Government; considers that this will negatively impact on the children, their families and teachers, who have fought against closure; believes that the closures will increase class sizes and pupil-teacher ratios, which is contrary to Scottish Government aims, and commends the nurseries for their role over the years in preparing children for school and developing their learning experiences&quot;.</p>
