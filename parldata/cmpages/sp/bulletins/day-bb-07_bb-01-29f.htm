<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5496</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Condemn the Cuts, Save the Jobs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of Dumfries and Galloway Council&rsquo;s Education and Community Services Committee to cut the teacher allocation to secondary schools; notes that this is a cut in a front-line service which the present administration is pledged to avoid; recognises that the main effects will be a reduction in the choice of courses available to pupils and increased class sizes; acknowledges that this cut effectively cancels out the extra teachers promised by the Scottish Executive to secure the reduction in class sizes in English and Maths to 20 from August 2007, and calls on Dumfries and Galloway Council to reconsider this decision and reinstate the 15 teaching posts affected.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5495</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Beating Bowel Cancer - 8th Loud Tie Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Beating Bowel Cancer&rsquo;s &quot;Loud Tie Campaign&quot; which aims to raise awareness of bowel cancer; notes that bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in Scotland, with around 1,600 people dying from the illness, and over 3,500 new cases being diagnosed, each year; recognises that early clinical detection and intervention can save lives; welcomes the roll-out, from March 2007, of the national screening programme, already piloted in Grampian, Tayside and Fife, which will see over 650,000 potentially vulnerable people being screened by 2009; urges people to take part in the national screening programme by returning their self-test kits; supports further improvements in bowel cancer services in Scotland which build on increased patient involvement and public awareness, delivered though managed clinical networks, and encourages MSPs to support national Loud Tie Week between 29 January and 4 February 2007 and to wear a loud tie or scarf on 6 February to show their support for the Beating Bowel Cancer campaign.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5494</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Green Procurement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the transposition into Scots Law of the European public procurement directive (2004/18/EEC) in January 2006 and, in particular, notes the directive&rsquo;s clarification that public bodies may legitimately specify social and environmental criteria in their procurement contracts; welcomes the publication by the European Commission of <em>Buying Green!: A Handbook on Environmental Public Procurement</em> but regrets that Scottish-specific guidance on the matter is not currently available, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make social and environmental criteria mandatory in all public contracts and to issue guidance to all local authorities and public bodies to enable them to meet these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5493</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>The Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Amendment of Specified Authorities) Order 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that the Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Amendment of Specified Authorities) Order 2007 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5492#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Rum&rsquo;s Red Deer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the red deer is an iconic part of the image of Scotland; further notes that, because of its isolation, the red deer herd on Rum has arguably the purest bloodline in the country and has been the subject of scientific research, and considers that Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s plans to cull Rum&rsquo;s red deer solely to protect the trees that it has decided to plant on the island without any protective fencing is to be condemned.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5485</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Keep the Sercos Out, Amend the PMS Act</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the terms of the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 (PMS Act) which enable a company limited by shares to be contracted to provide general medical services only on condition that one share is owned by a medical practitioner; but recognises that this has led to GP services being prey to companies like Serco, recognises that the legislation only states that NHS boards may enter into a contract with such a company, that open tendering to non-GPs is not a requirement and that NHS Lanarkshire could have fulfilled primary medical provision in Harthill by contracting directly with a GP or a partnership; believes that NHS Lanarkshire, which has revealed that one current and one former medical director work for Serco, has deliberately created an opportunity for expansion for Serco, but in any case considers that the current legislation places companies limited by shares in a more advantageous and less regulated position than single GPs or partnerships, and calls on the Scottish Executive to state clearly to NHS boards that they need not openly tender in the manner of NHS Lanarkshire and to amend the PMS Act to ensure that no such situation is allowed to occur in the future.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5480</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>SEERAD Animal Gatherings Order</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, if the Animal Gathering Order is introduced as proposed, it will introduce a licensing system under which event organisers would have to ensure a livestock standstill of 27 days before and 27 days after any show; further notes that it would require disinfectant facilities to be installed at every showground to clean and disinfect clothing and footwear that comes into contact with animal waste or mud and that it would also mean that all vehicles would need to be disinfected when entering and exiting show fields; believes that this will threaten the continuation of a great many livestock events across Scotland, events which are vital in maintaining the link between farmers, local communities and the general public; further notes that livestock bio-security problems rarely come from members of the public, but are instead almost always imported from other countries with poor bio-security and traceability systems, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to withdraw the order.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5472</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Prescription Charges Review</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that it is now exactly one year since the Stage 1 debate on the Abolition of NHS Prescription Charges (Scotland) Bill and since when the Scottish Executive promised to come forward with proposals to increase the list of long-term conditions exempt from payment; further notes that Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care, Lewis Macdonald MSP, has stated that he acknowledged that &quot;the current charge and exemption arrangements are no longer fit for purpose and that changes are necessary&quot; and that &quot;we will review the exemption arrangements for people with chronic conditions&quot; but that no changes have been brought forward by the Executive in a year despite giving repeated assurances in parliamentary answers that a decision was imminent; believes that no promised proposal has emerged because all medical experts have warned the Executive not to try to list the many different chronic conditions in an order of those that are more &quot;deserving&quot; or &quot;painful&quot;; considers that this is precisely what would be needed in order to distinguish between those conditions which are to be exempt from charges and which are not; notes that in 40 years medical opinion has veered away from such an approach because it was simply not possible on medical grounds to make such a judgement; believes that the Executive has failed to keep a promise it made to the Parliament and has dashed the hopes of thousands of chronically ill patients, and reiterates its belief that the fairest and most sensible way forward is to follow the example of the Welsh Assembly and abolish the &pound;6.75 prescription charge for every patient.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5447</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Controlled Emission Toilets on 158 Trains</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with disappointment that the planned refurbishment of the Class 158 trains used on the Far North Line will not include the fitting of controlled emission toilets; further notes that this will mean the continuation of the discharge of raw sewage on to the track, with resulting heath and safety implications; believes that in 2007 rail passengers should not be welcomed to the station by the sight and smell of raw sewage, and therefore calls on Scottish Ministers and First ScotRail to use the opportunity of the planned refurbishment of the Far North Line trains to fit controlled emission toilets.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie, Mr Brian Monteith</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5446</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Recommendations of Joint Administrators of Farepak Food and Gifts Limited</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication on 18 January 2007 of BDO Stoy Hayward&rsquo;s statement to creditors of Farepak Food and Gifts Limited; notes that unsecured creditor claims are estimated at &pound;46 million and that the dividend payment to these creditors is estimated at 5p in the pound; notes the recommendation of the joint administrators that Farepak should move to creditors&rsquo; voluntary liquidation and that a liquidator has wider powers of investigation than an administrator to take legal action against third parties, which could lead to further funds being released to creditors; notes also the proposal that a creditors&rsquo; committee be created, and hopes that the recommendations of the joint administrators will be supported by customers of Farepak in pursuance of their demands to know what happened to their money.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5445</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>James Watt College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is very concerned about the current situation at James Watt College, where debts are reported to be around &pound;6 million and the threat of redundancy hangs over many valuable members of staff; considers that the current situation is a result of decisions taken by the former college principal, Mr Bill Wardle, and the board of management; believes, therefore, that a payment of around &pound;130,000 to Mr Wardle is inappropriate and can only be seen as a reward for failure; further considers that current proposals to address the problems at the college, including reducing teaching staff costs, would equate to staff being punished for the failure of management; recognises that such proposals would ultimately lead to redundancies, an increased workload for the staff that remain and a diminution of the quality of education provided to students, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that sufficient funding and support is provided to James Watt College to ensure that there are no compulsory redundancies among staff and that students are not adversely affected by the failures visited on the college by the former principal and the board of management.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5444#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Threat to Crichton Campus in Dumfries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and applauds the success of the Crichton university campus in Dumfries over the past seven years and the contribution made by all stakeholders involved in this unique partnership; is therefore concerned that the University of Glasgow is considering reducing its presence on the campus and possibly withdrawing from the site; notes that the University of Glasgow is considering this action because of an &pound;800,000 annual shortfall in running its campus at the Crichton, and considers that the Scottish Funding Council should assist the University of Glasgow to maintain its presence at its Dumfries site and that the University of Glasgow should defer making any decision to reduce its presence or to withdraw from the site until after this year&rsquo;s spending review and the forthcoming review of higher education funding.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5443</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>British Airways Cabin Crew Strike Vote</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the threatened strike action by British Airways (BA) cabin crew over new company demands on sickness leave that they believe force them to work despite being ill; believes that the strength of feeling in the workforce was amply demonstrated by a union ballot last week which saw 96% vote in favour of strike action on the issue; regrets that the latest talks between the Transport and General Workers&rsquo; Union and the company have broken down, but calls on BA to take up the union&rsquo;s offer of further talks aimed at avoiding a damaging dispute and reaching an agreement on changes to the current sickness leave arrangements.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5427</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the Tribunals,&nbsp;Courts and Enforcement Bill, introduced in the House of Lords on 16 November 2006, (a) relating to the establishment of a new Tribunals Service and an Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council and (b) providing immunity from seizure for international works of art on loan to exhibitions in this country, so far as these matters fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5360</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5359#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Cervical Cancer and the HPV Vaccine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the licensing of the first vaccine against strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV) responsible for around 70% of cases of cervical cancer; expresses its concern that, despite a 40-year history of cervical screening in the United Kingdom, almost 3,000 women are diagnosed and 1,000 women still die of cervical cancer each year in the UK; recognises that the vaccine will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer and that it is not known whether it will prevent cancer in women already infected with HPV; therefore believes that the cervical cancer screening programme should be continued and that further action should be taken to increase the take-up of screening in more deprived areas, among ethnic minority groups and among women with learning difficulties; further believes that this will improve early detection and allow earlier treatment of this disease; recognises the role of charities such as Jo&rsquo;s Trust, Cancerbackup and Cancer Research UK, amongst others, in supporting patients with cervical cancer and their families and in counselling the thousands more women who worry about their health following an abnormal smear result; recognises the huge potential benefits to be had through vaccination in East Renfrewshire and throughout Scotland from reducing the incidence of cervical cancer, reducing the number of colposcopies, reducing the number of abnormal smears and reducing the number of people requiring treatment for genital warts; further recognises the success of the Scottish Executive in its public health campaigns and cancer prevention strategies, and considers that ministers should put in place measures to raise awareness and to prepare for a vaccination programme.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5290#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>90th Anniversary of Passchendaele</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 31 July 2007 will mark the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele which was launched on 31 July 1917 and continued until the fall of Passchendaele village on 6 November 1917; notes that Passchendaele saw the biggest loss of life of any battle in the First World War with over half a million British, Commonwealth and German troops killed, wounded or missing; notes that the Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 is currently planning a number of events to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the battle, including unveiling a Celtic cross as a memorial to commemorate Scottish soldiers who took part in the battle; thanks all governments, organisations and individuals that have contributed towards commemorations planned and towards the memorial; welcomes the memorial as it will commemorate the Scottish regiments that played a pivotal role in the battle, which saw the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the Black Watch, the Cameronians, the Gordon Highlanders, the Highland Light Infantry, the King&rsquo;s Own Scottish Borderers, the Queen&rsquo;s Own Cameron Highlanders, the Royal Scots, the Scots Guards and the Seaforth Highlanders in combat for the United Kingdom, fighting with dignity, skill and honour in treacherous conditions, and believes that the Scottish Executive should mark the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele and contribute towards the commemorations.</p>
