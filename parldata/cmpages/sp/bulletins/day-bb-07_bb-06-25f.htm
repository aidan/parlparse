<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-232</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Baldragon Academy&rsquo;s Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Baldragon Academy of Dundee on earning the chance to host BBC Radio Scotland&rsquo;s SoundTown project and notes that pupils will acquire technical and presentational skills while operating a radio studio for the next 12 months, contributing directly to a number of BBC Radio Scotland broadcasts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-231</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to West Lothian Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates West Lothian Council on becoming the first council in Scotland and the only unitary authority in the United Kingdom to be awarded a corporate Charter Mark, awarded as the highest recognition for excellence in public services, and also congratulates the staff of West Lothian Council for their outstanding achievement secured through many years of hard work and developing best practice.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-230</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Fife Schools&rsquo; Success in Scottish Education Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the five Fife schools recognised in this year&rsquo;s Scottish Education Awards, otherwise known as the education Oscars, and celebrates the exceptional achievements of Fife schools, teachers and pupils; commends Kirkcaldy High School for winning the Best Employer Partnership Award and, in particular, Iain Hirschseld from Inverkeithing High School for winning Teacher of the Year; further commends Yvonne Allan of Foulford Primary School, Cowdenbeath, on being shortlisted for Headteacher of the Year, Gina Clifford of Kirkland High School, Methil and Sean Duffy from Kirkcaldy High School on being shortlisted for Probationary Teacher of the Year, Kirkland High for being shortlisted for the Ambition Award and Tulliallan Primary for being shortlisted for the Better Behaviour and Attendance Award; recognises the significant achievement of Fife Council in winning the Making a Difference award, and calls on the new administration at Fife Council to continue to build on the excellent legacy of previous administrations.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-229</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Don&rsquo;t Give Fire A Home</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 20 individuals lost their lives in alcohol-related fires in 2006; acknowledges that the careless use of cigarettes, lighters, matches and the preparation of food while intoxicated are the main causes of these fatalities; further notes that the most likely group of people to start a fire while intoxicated is men aged 30 to 59, and supports the ongoing Don&rsquo;t Give Fire a Home campaign which seeks to reduce fire deaths and injuries by raising public awareness of fire risks in the home.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-228</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Women and Human Trafficking</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its continuing deep concern about the number of women who, falling victim to trafficking, are brought to Scotland and forced to work in our growing illegal sex trade; notes that more than 6,000 foreign women are already believed to be here through this route, many living a miserable existence as virtual prisoners of the criminal gangs who brought them to Scotland with promises of a new and better life, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work closely with the UK Government to ensure a well-resourced and co-ordinated inter-agency approach to ending sex slavery in Scotland and to provide to the women affected every possible chance to rescue themselves from those who would exploit them.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-222</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Welcome for the Cervical Cancer Vaccine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to recommend a new vaccination programme against the human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for around 70% of cases of cervical cancer; further welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s proposals to introduce this vaccination for girls aged 12 to 13 by autumn 2008; notes with concern that almost 3,000 women are diagnosed with and 1,000 women die from cervical cancer in the United Kingdom each year; recognises the huge long-term benefits to be had though vaccination not only in reducing deaths but in also reducing the number of colposcopies, reducing the number of abnormal smears and reducing the number of people requiring treatment for genital warts; also recognises however that the vaccine will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer; therefore believes that the cervical cancer screening programme should be continued and that further action should be taken to increase the take-up of screening in more deprived areas, among ethnic minority groups and among women with learning difficulties; further believes that this will improve early detection and allow earlier treatment of this disease, and welcomes the work of charities such as Jo&rsquo;s Trust, Cancerbackup and Cancer Research UK, among others, in supporting patients with cervical cancer and their families and in counselling the thousands more women who worry about their health following an abnormal smear result.</p>
