<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1622</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong> <strong>Home-Start East Lothian</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Home-Start East Lothian for its successful bid for a &pound;303,600 Supporting 21st Century Life grant from the Big Lottery Fund; notes that the expansion of the family support project funded by the grant will work to increase the confidence, self-esteem and life skills of vulnerable parents with at least one child under five; welcomes the expansion of the project which will provide families with suitably matched volunteer befrienders who will make weekly visits offering appropriate encouragement, life coping skills and parenting strategies, and wishes the project every success for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1621</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Healthcare Associated Infection Taskforce</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to bring infection rates down by investing &pound;54 million to support a far more intensive and targeted three-year programme of healthcare associated infection (HAI) work from 1 April 2008; believes that the Scottish Government is right to introduce a one-year pilot MRSA screening programme to shape a planned, structured and deliverable national screening programme from 2009-10; welcomes the links that will be established between the Patient Safety and Patient Experience programmes and the HAI agenda to bring about a coherency of approach in the way that NHSScotland delivers its service to patients; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s continuation of the multi-agency HAI Task Force, and agrees with the challenging target that the Scottish Government has set for all staff of NHS boards to achieve at least 90% hand hygiene compliance by November 2008.</p>
<p>Supported by: Shona Robison<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1620</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Clydesdale Bank Selection of Help the Hospices as their New Charity Partner</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision made by Clydesdale Bank to select Help the Hospices, the hospice movement&rsquo;s national charity, as its new charity partner; notes that Help the Hospices supports over 240 local hospices in their important frontline work in caring for people who are faced with terminal illness and death; recognises that the majority of hospice care is provided by local independent charities that work and are based in local communities; notes that around 100,000 volunteers work in UK hospices, recognises the hard work and commitment of all people who are involved in the work of hospices; congratulates the Clydesdale Bank on its decision to encourage its employees to participate in local volunteering and fundraising activities, and highlights the superb service, support and care provided for patients and their families by St Andrew&rsquo;s Hospice in Airdrie, Strathcarron Hospice in Denny and all other hospices across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1619</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Gurkhas&rsquo; First-Class Service, MOD&rsquo;s Second-Class Treatment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the campaign by the former Gurkhas to seek parity in pension and residency rights for those troops from the Brigade who served and fought as part of the British Army before 1997; recognises the bravery and distinction which the Gurkhas have demonstrated throughout their service, often in the frontline of many of the bloodiest conflicts in the world, and condemns the attitude of the Ministry of Defence and the UK Government in failing to honour these brave fighters by treating them as second-class troops, despite the first-class service that they have given over a period of 200 years.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1606</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Sparrowhawk Relocation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is aware that the Scottish Government is in the process of considering whether to issue a licence to the Scottish Homing Union for a trial project to translocate sparrowhawks at 15 racing pigeon lofts in central Scotland, ostensibly to test whether this measure protects racing pigeons from predation; expresses concern that the trial itself may not be lawful and that, regardless of this, any resulting licensed removal or killing of sparrowhawks may not be legal under Scottish legislation, including under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004; notes recent research which shows that sparrowhawks take less than 1% of released racing pigeons annually and considers that, although this predation may be very distressing when witnessed, it is a negligible threat to the interests of pigeon fanciers; further notes research which shows that most racing pigeons that go missing are not killed by sparrowhawks and other birds of prey but stray off course or are lost to bad weather; believes, therefore, that there is no scientific justification for suggesting that the killing or removal of sparrowhawks is an appropriate or proportionate response to this issue and, while sympathising with those whose pigeons may have been affected by sparrowhawks, calls on the Scottish Government to recognise that this interest should be safeguarded by loft-based protective measures only and should not be given priority ahead of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s international responsibility to protect its raptor populations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1606.1</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Sparrowhawk Relocation</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1606) in the name of Robin Harper, leave out from &quot;ostensibly&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes this long overdue initiative aimed at dealing humanely with the problem of the predation of homing pigeons by sparrow hawks at their lofts; recognises that relocation will only proceed on the basis of appropriate licences being issued by the relevant authorities; totally condemns the scaremongering and misinformation being visited on this project, and calls on the Scottish Government to proceed with their balanced approach to this problem without fear or favour.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1605</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>GM Crops</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposals by the Welsh Assembly Government to make producers of genetically modified (GM) crops fully liable for any damage that these crops cause; believes that this policy will in effect amount to a complete ban on the planting of GM crops because of the significant scientific uncertainty about the associated risks; notes the support that this move has received from the Farmers Union of Wales as well as from RSPB and other environmental organisations; further notes the decision by Scottish Ministers to continue with a moratorium on the planting of GM crops, and calls on Scottish Ministers to go further and adopt the same type of full liability approach proposed in Wales.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1604</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>ExxonMobil and Venezuelan Oil Assets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the High Court in London to suspend an earlier court order that froze US $12 billion (&pound;6 billion) of the assets of Venezuela&rsquo;s state oil firm, PDVSA; notes the comments of the Venezuelan Ambassador to the United Kingdom, who said that ExxonMobil had been using courts outside Venezuela to conduct a &quot;campaign of harassment against PDVSA around the world&quot;, and calls on all multi-national companies to respect the sovereign rights of countries to manage their natural resources as they see fit.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1592</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Standing Up for Edinburgh&rsquo;s Youngest and Poorest</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses considerable concern at the decision of the SNP/Liberal Democrat-led City of Edinburgh Council to cut &pound;300,000 from the Edinburgh Leisure budget, resulting in all but two cr&egrave;ches at city leisure facilities closing; believes that the provision of cr&egrave;ches is vital for some families with more than one child to enjoy council leisure facilities; considers that cr&egrave;ches provide a vital role in improving and promoting the health of young parents and are particularly important to mothers suffering from post-natal depression, and further believes that these cuts to cr&egrave;che facilities, combined with earlier cuts to full-time nursery places, cuts in hours of care in part-time nursery places, cuts to Sure Start funding in Edinburgh totalling &pound;966,000, cuts of &pound;850,000 to Community Learning and Development funds and substantial cuts to grants for local voluntary groups and organisations, including &pound;357,000 being removed from the council&rsquo;s previously acclaimed Youth Services, demonstrates that the youngest and poorest people across the city of Edinburgh are suffering at the hands of the SNP in power.</p>
