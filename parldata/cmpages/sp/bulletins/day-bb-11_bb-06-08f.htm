<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section </a>the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00235 John Swinney: Scotland Bill &ndash; Borrowing Powers and Growing the Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Scotland Bill proposals on capital borrowing and the recommendations of the Scotland Bill Committee in that regard; calls on the UK Government and Scottish Government to undertake joint work to agree a clear, long-term and principles-based approach to capital borrowing and the sources of borrowing including the potential for bonds, and calls for the implementation of capital borrowing powers at an accelerated timescale to that proposed in the Scotland Bill to support economic recovery and enhance Scotland&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00234 Jackie Baillie: Caring for Scotland&rsquo;s Older People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s new focus on the care for older people; further welcomes the commitment given by the First Minister that vulnerable residents in Southern Cross homes will not be compromised as a result of Southern Cross&rsquo;s business model; notes with concern the report by the Mental Welfare Commission regarding the appalling treatment of Mrs V at Ninewells Hospital and the recent disturbing events at the Elsie Inglis Nursing Home in Edinburgh where standards of care were totally inadequate; further notes that one in 10 of the city&rsquo;s care homes have been criticised and deemed weak or unsatisfactory in at least one area of assessment in the past year; believes that the 25% cut to the budget of Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland (SCSWIS), charged with the inspection and improvement of care standards, should be reversed; agrees that radical reform of community health partnerships is urgently required following the serious failings identified in a recent Audit Scotland report; recognises that funding prevention work will delay services for older people requiring formal care; believes that the care and safety of Scotland&rsquo;s older and vulnerable people must be a major priority for the Scottish Government, and therefore calls on it to come forward urgently with plans to integrate health and social care so that Scotland&rsquo;s older people and their families can have full confidence that they will receive the best possible standard of care when they need it.</p>
