<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1374</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>20th Anniversary of Da Voar Redd Up</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Da Voar Redd Up, Shetland&rsquo;s groundbreaking community-based environmental clean-up project, continues, after 20 years of operation, to provide Shetland&rsquo;s environment with an annual spring clean; further notes that, while 20 tonnes of rubbish were collected from Shetland&rsquo;s beaches, roadsides and other public spaces in 1988, 50 tonnes were collected last year by some 4,000 volunteers; believes that Da Voar Redd Up is an excellent example of a well-supported community project, involving a wide range of individuals, families, youth groups, sports clubs, hall committees, schools, church groups, boating clubs and many other community groups, and sends its congratulations to all those involved in the event over the last 20 years, who have collected more than 1,000 tonnes of rubbish, and its best wishes to all those who plan to take part in the 21st Voar Redd Up later this spring.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1373</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Kosovo</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that Kosovo is now safe and stable because of the NATO-led campaign in 1999 after aggressions there resulted in the death of around 10,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 ethnic Serbians; remembers that Alex Salmond described this action as &quot;misguided policy&quot; and &quot;unpardonable folly&quot;; believes that the conclusive action of the Labour-led UK Government helped to prevent a larger-scale conflict in the Balkans, further loss of life and a humanitarian crisis; considers that it is in part because of this decisive action in stark contrast to the SNP&rsquo;s defeatist approach at the time that we see Kosovans celebrating independence in the streets of Pristina waving Union Jacks and American flags; further believes that the international intervention took place because of the atrocities against an ethnic minority within Serbia, not in order to free an oppressed nation from occupation; accepts that unilateral independence for Kosovo was not the ideal solution, and considers that the celebratory tone of Aileen Campbell&rsquo;s motion, S3M-1363, is misguided at best and political opportunism in the extreme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1372</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Pension Rights for Injured Firefighters</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Scottish Government to issue new guidance on protecting the pension rights of firefighters disabled in the line of duty; believes that the previous system whereby seriously injured firefighters assessed as fit to carry out desk duties could lose their pension rights even if no alternative post could be found for them was inherently unfair, and congratulates the Fire Brigades Union for its success in campaigning for this new guidance.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1371</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong> <strong>Cockenzie House Nursing Home</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the imminent closure of Cockenzie House Nursing Home; expresses concern that this will result in the enforced moving of 42 frail and vulnerable residents, and urges East Lothian Council, the Care Commission and the home&rsquo;s owner to engage in meaningful discussions at this late stage to ensure that care continues in the facility for the benefit of the residents, their families and the local community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1370</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Put Edinburgh on the Global Monopoly Board</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Hasbro, the maker of Monopoly, is making a global edition of the popular board game; backs the campaign by Edinburgh residents to see Scotland&rsquo;s capital city included on the board; further notes that, on account of its popularity with residents, tourists and travel writers, Edinburgh is one of the 68 worldwide cities being considered for the global board, and encourages all those who want to see Edinburgh included to vote for the city on the monopoly website before voting closes on 29 February 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1369</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>The Continuing Humanitarian Crisis in the Gaza Strip</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its continuing concern about the ongoing blockade of Gaza and the Israeli Government&rsquo;s decision to begin reducing the electricity supply to 1.5 million Palestinians, including children and innocent civilians, many of whom already live in poverty, 80% of whom are dependent on food aid and 55% of whom are without employment; notes that the situation continues despite warnings from the United States and others against a worsening of the humanitarian situation of the civilian population in Gaza; further notes that human rights groups working in the region argue that the cut in power supplies along with the virtual closure of much of Gaza&rsquo;s perimeter by Israel violates international law and believes that this amounts to collective punishment of the Palestinian peoples, and therefore calls on the international community to respond urgently to this humanitarian crisis at the same time as working for a peaceful, just and lasting solution for all Palestinians and Israelis.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1363.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Kosovan Independence</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1363) in the name of Aileen Campbell, leave out from &quot;believes that independence&quot; to end and insert &quot;and welcomes the sudden interest being taken by SNP politicians in the welfare of the people of Kosova which stands in stark contrast to the First Minister who, as SNP Leader in 1999, condemned as &quot;unpardonable folly&quot; the NATO intervention to protect the Kosovan people against Serbian aggression.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1362</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>WWF Campaign for Strong Scottish Climate Change Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of WWF Scotland&rsquo;s campaign for a strong Scottish Climate Change Bill, which will engage with communities across the country through 25 public events over the course of the public consultation on the Bill proposals; believes that, in tackling climate change, Scotland as a nation can lead the way and, alongside those backing this campaign, supports calls for the Bill to establish the legal framework to achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and a statutory annual target of at least 3% emission reductions year on year and to include reductions in emissions from aviation and shipping, and further notes that these calls are supported across the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland coalition, a broad coalition of environment, development, community and faith groups and UNISON Scotland.</p>
