<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4104</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Foster Care in Aberdeen City</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the invaluable service that foster carers play in providing children with safe and caring homes while they are unable to live with their own families; congratulates Aberdeen City Council for its recent efforts to recruit additional foster carers, which has resulted in an increase in the number of carers from 111 in January 2008 to 129 in January 2009; notes that the Foster Care Fortnight campaign will run across the United Kingdom from 11 to 24 May 2009, and hopes that this campaign and other initiatives will help further boost the numbers of foster carers in Aberdeen city and across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4103</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Appalling Asset Management in Local Government</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with extreme concern the contents of the Audit Scotland report, <em>Asset management in local government</em>; recognises the report as a devastating record of poor organisation and lack of coordination; notes that fewer than half of councils have approved corporate asset management strategies, only half have complete property strategies and only half provide regular information to elected members on property performance; further notes, in the context of the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill in particular, that paragraph 21 of Audit Scotland&rsquo;s associated key message document indicates that &quot;environmental sustainability is not a key factor in building design. Most councils are missing opportunities for incorporating environmentally friendly features into the design of new buildings&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government, as a matter of urgency, to consult with COSLA on the way forward to address these problems through the outcome agreements associated with their concordat.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4102</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>The Sullivan Report on Low Carbon Building Standards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the work of the Scottish Ecological Design Association (SEDA) over the last two decades; congratulates SEDA on its recent conference on Brettstaple Massive Wood Construction; in particular congratulates Howard Liddell and Gaia Architects on the opening of Acharacle Primary School in the Highland region, built using Brettstaple technology and certain to be the most energy-efficient primary school in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to respond formally to the recommendations set out in the Sullivan report, <em>A Low Carbon Building Standards Strategy for Scotland</em>, and to publish a roadmap to zero carbon new buildings in Scotland at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4101</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government Must Accept the Will of Parliament on Glasgow Community Court</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of the Scottish Government not to proceed with the establishment of a community court in Glasgow<font color="#0000ff">; </font>further notes the Parliament&rsquo;s resolution on the matter on motion S3M-4065 on Thursday 7 May 2009<font color="#0000ff">;</font> calls on the Scottish Government to accept the will of the Parliament on the matter, to reverse its decision and to progress plans for a community court in Glasgow, and also calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to make an urgent statement to the Parliament on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4100</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Brush Barclay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the management and workers at railway rolling stock company Brush Barclay on the successful completion of the first stage of a &pound;3.5 million contract, which saw five of a planned 16 refurbished rail units handed over to operators First Great Western; recognises that this was the first major contract that the company secured after its predecessor, Hunslet-Barclay, was placed in administration; applauds the efforts made by the management and workforce to rescue the company, and wishes them well in carrying forward an enterprise that has had a presence in Kilmarnock since Andrew Barclay and Sons entered the railway engineering business 150 years ago.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4096</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Stop the Failed ID Card Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing roll-out of the ID card scheme, which it considers to be a baseless unproven policy, which is estimated to cost in excess of &pound;5 billion; denounces unchecked executive powers whereby individuals would be managed by executive order and could be added to the national identity register by the Home Secretary without their consent; condemns excessive accumulation of personal data, which will lead to lifelong surveillance in a database state; joins with David Blunkett MP, the former Home Secretary who introduced the ID card scheme, in insisting that the UK Government scrap this unnecessary scheme, described by some as an ineffective plastic poll tax; questions this use of resources at a time when the Scottish Government is being asked to make cuts in vital public services, and hopes that UK ministers will appreciate a citizen&rsquo;s right to privacy, freedom and trust, which seemingly has again been disregarded under Labour.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4094</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Geographical Confusion at Museums Galleries Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with surprise that the spring 2009 edition of <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Museums and Galleries Quarterly</em>, published by Museums Galleries Scotland, which rightly celebrates the opening of the Caithness Horizons museum, describes the museum as being in the &quot;most northerly town in the UK&quot;; is concerned that an organisation that describes itself as the &quot;lead body for the advocacy, funding and development of over 340 museums and galleries in Scotland&quot; should have such a flawed knowledge of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s geography, and considers that, if this is indeed the geographical view of Scotland&rsquo;s museums, then the ownership of the great wealth of antiquities from Orkney and Shetland currently held by the National Museum of Scotland should be transferred to the museums in Orkney and Shetland with those museums deciding which artefacts to lend to Edinburgh, rather than the other way round, as at present.</p>
