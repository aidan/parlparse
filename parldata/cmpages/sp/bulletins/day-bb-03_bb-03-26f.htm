            and their officials in respect of the requirements of disabled citizens 
            when they visit polling stations to cast their votes but believes

            Majesty's Government, in consultation with the Royal National Institute

            Royal Infirmary will be either paying £250 per annum for a parking 
            permit if they have been successful in their application or paying 
            £10 per day Monday to Friday and £3 per day at weekends; believes 
            that there has been an over-issue of permits; notes that using public 
            transport may be staff's only option and that, for a theatre staff 
            nurse living in Penicuik and working an 11-hour shift from 7.30am 
            to 6.30pm, this will mean leaving home at 6.20am, changing bus with 
            a three-minute transfer time, in order to arrive at work in time to 
            begin the shift, assuming that all buses run to time; refers to the 
            answer to written question S1W-27065 on 16 July 2002 that stated that 
            a review of car parking charges was to be undertaken; calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to publish results of that review as a matter of 
            urgency, and expresses concern that hospital staff on shifts, with 
            modest income and working in essential medical services, are being 
            charged in this manner. </font></p>

            Food and Rural Affairs' proposal to cut the compensation to them for 
            animals slaughtered under the Over Thirty Months Scheme; further notes 
            that this cut is for apparent financial reasons prior to the completion 
            of the Food Standards Agency's review of the scheme, and calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to press for a delay in the cuts until the 
            Food Standards Agency's consultation on changes to the scheme is completed 
            and a proper strategy put in place for the gradual withdrawal of the

            in infrastructure and skills improvement but believes more must be 
            done to deliver maximum growth and a competitive advantage for the

            of the Scottish Enterprise network and a reduction in Scottish business 
            rates to below the United Kingdom rate in the course of the next session 
            of the Parliament, and believes that the optimal policy to release 
            Scotland's full economic potential requires the Scottish government 
            to be equipped with the same competitive policy tools as Scotland's 
            independent competitors focussed on delivering the maximum possible

            first devolved parliamentary session, business start-ups have declined, 
            business regulation has intensified, strategic transport investment 
            has been neglected and business rates have increased, and calls upon 
            the Scottish Executive to recreate a competitive business environment 
            by increasing the annual transport budget by £100 million, cutting 
            the business rate poundage to the level of England and taking pro-active

            that only a radically different economic policy can change this situation, 
            including (a) a £7.32 per hour minimum wage in the public sector, 
            (b) creating 24,000 jobs by legislating for a 35-hour maximum working 
            week in the Scottish public sector, (c) funding the training of 5,000 
            new apprenticeships in construction-related trades as part of a general 
            strategy to build public sector homes, schools, community facilities 
            and hospitals, (d) refusing contracts to any company that is anti-trade 
            union, (e) taking over without compensation the assets, including 
            factories, offices and equipment, of multinational companies that 
            pull out of Scotland in search of cheap labour elsewhere and imposing 
            heavy financial penalties on those companies, (f) supporting trade

            standards and working conditions, (g) ensuring that all public sector 
            trainees are paid trade union-negotiated rates of pay, (h) regenerating 
            local economies by returning the uniform business rate to the control 
            of local authorities, (i) investigating a more progressive form of 
            local business taxation to transfer the burden of business rates away 
            from small businesses and new businesses on to bigger and more profitable 
            businesses and (j) setting up a skills diversification programme involving 
            the Scottish Trade Union Congress, in preparation for the future decommissioning 
            of Scotland's nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons bases.&quot;</a></font></p>
