            the Scottish Executive when it now estimates that the second tranche 
            of ex-gratia payments will be made to Scottish Transport Group pensioners 
            and whether it will abide by the indication given in the letter of 
            1 November 2002 by the Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and 
            Lifelong Learning to the Convener of the Petitions Committee that 
            &quot;a second tranche&quot; will be paid &quot;early in the next

            the Scottish Executive how many Scottish Transport Group pension scheme 
            members the statement made by the Deputy Minister for Education, Transport

          <p><strong>S1W-32503</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-30691 
            by Dr Richard Simpson on 8 November 2002, what consideration it has 
            given, in drafting amendments to the Extradition Bill in respect of 
            the European arrest warrant, to the decision of the English High Court 
            of Justice in <em>R ex parte Ramda</em> v <em>Secretary of State for 
            the Home Department</em> (27 June 2002) in which the court stated that 
            since the European Court of Human Rights is not a court of appeal 
            and there is no recourse to it as of right, the Home Secretary was 
            not justified in relying on the European court to correct any eventual 
            failure on the part of a foreign country to accord a fair trial to 
            a person extradited to that country.</p>
