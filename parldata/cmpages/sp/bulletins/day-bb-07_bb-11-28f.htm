<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-946</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>St Andrew&rsquo;s Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes in the importance of celebrating Scotland&rsquo;s national day; recognises the opportunity that it offers to both celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the 21st century and to promote a fair and inclusive society; notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proactive support of a programme of events throughout the country and all of Scotland&rsquo;s six cities; commends the work of schools and community groups across Scotland in teaching our young people about St Andrew&rsquo;s Day and promoting diversity through their celebrations, and furthermore thanks the St Andrew&rsquo;s societies, Caledonian societies, Scottish Development International, Globalscots, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and all the other overseas organisations who have planned over 100 wide-ranging celebrations in countries around the world.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-945</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Tourism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vital role that tourism has in increasing sustainable economic growth in line with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Economic Strategy; reiterates its support for the ambitions set out in the Tourism Framework for Change that tourism revenue should increase by 50% in real terms in the decade to 2015 and that Scotland should be one of Europe&rsquo;s most sustainable tourism destinations; recognises the appetite in the industry to improve and exceed visitor expectation, and welcomes the fact that these ambitions are shared between the public, private and third sectors.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-944</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Road Hauliers and a Fuel Price Regulator</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Road Haulage Association&rsquo;s campaign to introduce a fuel price regulator; notes the burdensome cost of fuel for motorists and the road haulage industry which affects Scotland; notes that Scotland is one of the world&rsquo;s largest oil producers with oil at record prices; further highlights the negative effect of soaring fuel prices on competitiveness; urges the UK Government to close the gap between fuel duties charged in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe; considers that the revenues from fuel duties and VAT, accounting for 60% of the price of petrol and diesel, pose an unfair burden on industry and consumers, and calls on the UK Government to introduce a fuel price regulator which would ensure the smooth modulation of VAT on fuel to reflect changes in the price of oil thus protecting hauliers and consumers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-943</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Ratho Indoor Climbing Wall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the plans to build a new competition-standard climbing wall at the Edinburgh International Climbing Arena; recognises that the building of such a wall will open the potential for the centre to host international climbing events, including the sport&rsquo;s world championship; notes that this will generate a much-needed boost to the local economy, and anticipates that the centre will continue to be a favourite destination for the sport&rsquo;s enthusiasts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-942</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>

<p>after</p>
<p>2.30 pm&#9;Time for Reflection</p>
<p>insert&#9;</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Ministerial Statement: Pension Benefits Statements</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-940</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games Bill at Stage 1 be completed by 29 February 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-939</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 (Incidental, Supplemental and Consequential Provisions) Order 2007 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-938</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2007 Amendment Order 2007 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-937</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Committee Remit and Duration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to amend the remit and duration of the Scottish Parliamentary Pension Scheme Committee as follows: </p>
<p>Remit: To inquire into and report with recommendations for a Committee Bill on a replacement for the Scottish Parliamentary Pension Scheme rules and the Grants to Members and Officeholders Order;</p>
<p>Duration: Until the Parliament has completed its consideration of the committee&rsquo;s report and any ensuing Bill.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-936</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>CHILDREN 1ST New Tayside Premises</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates CHILDREN 1ST on the opening of its new Tayside premises in Dundee; notes that CHILDREN 1ST, formerly the Royal Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children, has helped Dundee&rsquo;s most vulnerable children and families for over&nbsp;70 years; further notes that from its new premises CHILDREN 1ST will continue to provide much-needed support to children and their families affected by family breakdown, abuse or neglect, including those affected by substance misuse, and recognises the important contribution of CHILDREN 1ST&rsquo;s  staff and volunteers across the whole of Scotland whose hard work helps give vulnerable children and young people a brighter future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-935</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Small European Countries Work Better</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the latest OECD figures which show that GDP per head in Norway, Ireland and Luxembourg is more than 125% above the OECD average; considers that this is further proof that small European countries are better at running their own economies and meeting the challenges of globalisation than big countries like Britain, and believes that the quicker Scotland is independent, the quicker we will be able to join our neighbours at the top of the world league.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-934</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Prince&rsquo;s Trust and the Lion&rsquo;s Den Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the five Scottish legal firms that are taking part in The Prince&rsquo;s Trust&rsquo;s Lions&rsquo; Den Challenge; congratulates them and their mentors on their innovative fundraising concepts which have raised much-needed funds to help Scotland&rsquo;s young people who have struggled at school, been in care, are long-term unemployed or have been in trouble with the law, and wishes them all the best for the final on Monday 3 December 2007.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-933</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>RNIB Report on Election Experiences of People with Sight Loss</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the RNIB report, <em>Make it count</em>, on the election experiences of people with sight loss; notes the issues identified from individual experience in the report, particularly those of staff training, design including font size and colour contrast, the need for good lighting, better polling booth design and voter advice and information in polling stations, and the problem of delayed despatch of postal ballot papers; notes also the recommendation for the appointment of a Chief Returning Officer; urges the Scotland Office and the Scottish Government to consider and act on the report along with the recommendations in the Gould report and to involve organisations like RNIB more closely in arrangements for future elections, and believes that it is an urgent requirement of any democracy that all its citizens should be able to cast an effective vote in a manner suited to their needs.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-932</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Liberal Democrat Defection to the Conservatives</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the defection of the Liberal Democrat MEP, Sajjad Karim, to the Conservative group in the European Parliament; believes that the switch is the latest example of the Conservative Party&rsquo;s appeal spreading across the political spectrum; notes that Sajjad Karim stated that the Liberal Democrats have &quot;lost their way&quot;, and believes that this defection is indicative of the transfer of support from millions of former Liberal Democrat voters to the Conservatives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-931</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Aden 40th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the 27 November 2007 marks the 40th anniversary of UK withdrawal from Aden after the Aden Emergency; praises and commemorates the British soldiers that served in Aden and recognises the important role that Scottish regiments played in the war; in particular notes the famous actions of Lt-Col Colin Mitchell and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, which saw Mitchell lead the regiment back into the Crater area of Aden in July 1967 to recover the bodies of fallen British soldiers and take control of the district of about 80,000 people without a single British casualty; recognises that the regiment&rsquo;s actions helped avoid a security breakdown in the area which was happening elsewhere in Aden, and believes that the Ministry of Defence must do more to remember and commemorate the lesser-known wars that the United Kingdom fought in during the 20th&nbsp;century and that the valour and actions of the soldiers who fought in Aden and other lesser-known wars must never be forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-930</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Healthy Living Centres</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the positive contribution of healthy living centres across Scotland, whose aim is to promote good health in its broadest sense, to reduce health inequalities and to improve the health of the most disadvantaged sections of the population; notes with concern that the five-year lottery funding for many of these individual groups is at, or will soon be coming to, an end; recognises the valuable contribution that healthy living centres make in individual communities, such as the Janny&rsquo;s Hoose in Inverness and Healthways in Ross and Cromarty, and calls on local authorities and NHS boards to enter into funding negotiations with the Scottish Executive to secure a continued long-term funding solution for these very worthwhile organisations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-929</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Marsh Trust Scottish Volunteer of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Shaun Jamieson, volunteer worker in the Barnardo&rsquo;s store in Wester Hailes, Edinburgh, for being selected as Scottish Volunteer of the Year by the Marsh Trust; applauds the valuable work done by volunteers across Scotland; recognises the crucial role that voluntary sector organisations play in daily life in Scotland, and urges all who can to offer some of their time to help voluntary organisations to continue their important work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-928.1</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Equality and Diversity</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-928) in the name of Stewart Maxwell, insert at end &quot;further welcomes the creation of the Scottish Commission for Human Rights with a remit to promote and encourage best practice in human rights including the rights of those groups whose rights are not otherwise sufficiently promoted; regrets the absence of a commitment to the mainstreaming of equality in the Scottish budget document; is concerned at the rolling up into the local government settlement of equalities funding, including the Violence Against Women Fund and the Women&rsquo;s Aid Fund where they will have to compete with other local government delivery priorities, and therefore believes that the Scottish Government should clarify its commitment to mainstreaming equality and how its identified equalities funding will support that objective.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-928.2</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Equality and Diversity</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-928) in the name of Stewart Maxwell, insert at end &quot;further recognises that equality impact assessment tools should be used in determining and assessing policy priorities and spending allocations, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a statement to the Parliament detailing how the above commitments on equality and diversity will be delivered through the Scottish budget.&quot;</p>
