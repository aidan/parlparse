          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as 
            members&#146; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol 
            (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-182#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne: Ten Years of Council 
            Tax</strong>&#151;That the Parliament considers the impact of the 
            operation of the council tax following its 10th anniversary; notes 
            with concern the 80% increase in the tax over these 10 years; acknowledges 
            that pensioners&#146; incomes rise more slowly than those of working-age 
            people as pensioners&#146; incomes rise only in line with prices, 
            which grow more slowly than earnings, thereby placing an unfair burden 
            on older people; recognises that the council tax accounts for an average 
            5% of pensioners household income compared with 3% for working-age 
            households, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should 
            take action to reduce the financial misery faced by less well-off 
            pensioners.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-181</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Animal Welfare 
            Centres</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
            decision to hand all responsibility for animal welfare to its Environment 
            and Rural Affairs Department; recognises that the Scottish Society 
            for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been calling for such 
            a move since 1999, and believes that this will end confusion and allow 
            animal welfare issues to be dealt with more effectively.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-180</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Greater Glasgow 
            NHS Board Withdrawal of Beta Interferon</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the decision of Greater Glasgow NHS Board to cap 
            the number of sufferers of multiple sclerosis (MS) who will be treated 
            with beta interferon, the drug widely thought to offer respite to 
            MS sufferers and provide them with the best chance of a normal life; 
            further notes the statement by the Scottish Executive on 4 February 
            2002 that &quot;the NHS will pay for the cost of beta interferon and 
            similar drugs for all qualifying patients in Scotland&quot;, and considers 
            that the Executive should make urgent representations to the board 
            and take all possible measures to ensure the necessary resources are 
            put in place to guarantee that all MS sufferers in the board area 
            receive the treatments they require.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-179</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: The Future of 
            the Scottish Legal System</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            the views expressed by Lord Hope, at present a law lord and past President 
            of the Court of Session, that, if the supreme court proposed by the 
            Prime Minister becomes part of the Royal Courts of Justice, it cannot 
            have jurisdiction over Scottish courts which are protected by the 
            Treaty of Union; further notes that Scottish civil cases can be appealed 
            to the House of Lords whilst Scottish criminal appeals cannot be so 
            appealed; calls on the Minister for Justice to engage in consultations 
            with Scottish judges, the legal profession, organisations concerned 
            with advising the public on legal issues and MSPs on the implications 
            of the Prime Minister&#146;s proposals for the Scottish legal system, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the views of the 
            Scottish Parliament, and not the United Kingdom Parliament, on the 
            future of the Scottish legal system are paramount.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-178</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson: Defenders of 
            Human Rights - PREDA</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the outstanding 
            work of the PREDA Foundation, the People&#146;s Recovery Empowerment 
            and Development Assistance Foundation Inc., founded by Father Shay 
            Cullen in 1974 and working for human rights and protecting young people 
            from being exploited by the sex industry in the Philippines; further 
            notes with concern the increasing threats and harassment being experienced 
            by those working to protect sexually abused and exploited children 
            within the Philippines, and calls on the Government of the Philippines 
            to act on behalf of the Defenders of Human Rights and implement Article 
            12.2 of the UN Paris Declaration of 1998.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-177#</strong> <strong>Mr Jeremy Purvis: European Structure 
            Funds and South of Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the importance to the south of Scotland of European structural funds; 
            welcomes the investment of £44 million in projects such as the Ettrick 
            Riverside Centre, Selkirk, the Eastgate Arts Centre, Peebles, the 
            Border Union Showground, Kelso and harbour investment in Eyemouth; 
            appreciates the efforts of agencies working in partnership to deliver 
            a full spend of the allocated funding, and stresses the importance 
            of the continuation of such funding after 2006, whether delivered 
            from Brussels or repatriated.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-176</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Human Rights Abuses 
            in Chechnya and Visit of President Putin</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the ongoing conflict in Chechnya; expresses profound concern 
            at the findings of Amnesty International that human rights abuses, 
            including disappearances, extra-judicial executions and torture, are 
            perpetrated on a daily basis by Russian forces on Chechen civilians, 
            and wishes to communicate this concern in the strongest possible terms 
            to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, during 
            his visit to Edinburgh.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-175</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: Visit by President 
            Putin and Human Rights Abuses in Chechnya</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, 
            is visiting Scotland as a guest of the Scottish Executive and invites 
            the Executive to raise the issue of the treatment of Chechens who, 
            according to a recent report by Amnesty International, have been subjected 
            to gross violations of their human rights, including torture, rape 
            and executions by the Russian army.</p>
