          <p><strong>*S1M-3145#</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe: Legislation for 
            Increased Penalties for Wildlife Crime</strong>-That the Parliament 
            <a name="MotionText"></a>recognises that, while a dedicated, all-encompassing, 
            natural heritage Bill based on the proposals in <em>The Nature of Scotland</em> 
            consultation document would be the preferred option, recent incidents 
            such as the poisoning of a sea eagle and a golden eagle in Ayrshire, 
            poisoning of a golden eagle in Aberdeenshire and the theft of two 
            full clutches of osprey eggs in Perthshire, demonstrate the increasing 
            urgency of delivering legislation that brings the level of sanctions 
            against wildlife criminals into line with those available in England 
            and Wales within this session of the Parliament and before next year's 
            breeding season, and considers that the Executive should (a) progress 
            legislation on wildlife crime through amendments to the Criminal Justice 
            (Scotland) Bill and (b) reiterate its firm commitment to, and give 
            a timetable for, a Bill to enact the remaining proposals in <em>The 
            Nature of Scotland.</em></p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3142 Conservative Support for Creationist Schools</strong> 
            (lodged on 22 May 2002) Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3142.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Conservative 
            Support for Creationist Schools</strong>-As an amendment to motion 
            (S1M-3142) in the name of Michael Russell, <a name="AmendmentText">leave 
            out from &quot;astonishment&quot; to end and insert &quot;disappointment 
            the hypocrisy of the Scottish National Party, which one week proclaimed 
            itself the champion of choice and diversity in education and the next 
            condemns any educators with whom they disagree; derides Michael Russell's 
            assumption that creationist views have nothing to do with the great 
            religious faiths in Scotland and the wider world when there are different 
            views among Christians in many mainstream denominations on the question 
            of creation and evolution; notes that, under Conservative proposals, 
            any state-funded school in Scotland would be required to teach the 
            curriculum and be subject to inspections by Her Majesty's Inspectorate 
            of Education; warmly welcomes the findings of the poll commissioned 
            by the Catholic Church in Scotland which showed that the majority 
            of Scots support the right of Catholic parents to send their children 
            to Catholic schools and that the overwhelming majority of Scots believe 
            that moral values should be taught in schools; recognises the importance 
            of diversity in Scottish education, and believes that the best way 
            to deliver this is through greater parental choice.&quot;</a></p>
