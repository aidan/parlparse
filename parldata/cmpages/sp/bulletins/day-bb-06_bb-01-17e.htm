<p><strong>S2W-22350 Jim Mather:</strong> To ask the Scottish  Executive, in light of the statement in<em> Government Expenditure and Revenues in  Scotland 2003-04</em> (GERS) that unidentifiable expenditure outside the United  Kingdom was allocated to Scotland on the same basis as non-identifiable  expenditure, in line with the principle that &ldquo;expenditure outside the UK is  non-identifiable from the perspective of the UK&rsquo;s constituent countries, as the  benefits are shared between them&rdquo;, how much of the expenditure on the Channel  Tunnel Rail Link in 2003-04 was classified in HM Treasury&rsquo;s public expenditure  database as being outside the UK and, of this, what proportion the Executive allocated  to Scotland in GERS; how much of the expenditure on the Channel Tunnel Rail  Link in 2003-04 was identifiable within the UK and, of this, what proportion  was identifiable to Scotland, and whether the Executive considers the  differences in proportions allocated to Scotland to be justifiable.</p>
