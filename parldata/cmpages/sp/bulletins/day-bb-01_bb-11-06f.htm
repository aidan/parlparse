          <p><strong>*S1M-2406</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Reports into 
            the Investigation, Legal Proceedings and Family Liaison Arrangements 
            in the Case of the Murder of Surjit Singh Chhokar</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Executive to take 
            forward the recommendations of Sir Anthony Campbell and Dr Raj Jandoo 
            in connection with the murder of Surjit Singh Chhokar; recognises 
            the significance of these issues to Scottish society as a whole, and 
            the Scottish criminal justice system in particular, and notes the 
            progress that has already been made on race, family liaison and victims 
            issues by the Scottish police service and the Crown Office and Procurator 
            Fiscal Service.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2405</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Chickenpox Vaccine</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the current anxiety caused by the contentious 
            MMR vaccine and possible links to autism; rejects the possible introduction 
            of the chickenpox vaccine combined with the MMR vaccination, and further 
            notes the insensitivity of the action of the UK Department of Health 
            in Whitehall in introducing another live vaccine when there has been 
            a call for single vaccinations due to the controversy and possible 
            damage the triple MMR vaccine may have caused. </p>
