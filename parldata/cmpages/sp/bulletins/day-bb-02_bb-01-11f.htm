          <p><strong>*S1M-2595#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow to 
            Edinburgh Rail Service</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the current ScotRail dispute and the resulting cut in the Glasgow 
            to Edinburgh route to a half hourly rail service; urges the Scottish 
            Executive to make urgent representations to ScotRail to resolve the 
            dispute and to ensure the earliest possible reintroduction of the 
            15 minute service; recognises the necessity for Scotland's largest 
            two conurbations to be linked by the best possible rail service, and 
            condemns the remarks of Robert Brown MSP, calling for the service 
            to be cut to half hourly on a permanent basis, as reported in the 
            <em>Evening Times</em> on 10 January 2002. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2594</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh: Nuclear Test 
            Veterans</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes last month's ruling by the 
            Pensions Appeal Tribunal on Tom Duggan, a nuclear test veteran who 
            served in the armed forces during Britain's first A-bomb programme 
            on Christmas Island in 1958 and contracted lymphatic cancer following 
            exposure to radiation; notes that the tribunal's decision could finally 
            prove to be the decisive case that overturns decades of claims by 
            Her Majesty's Government that the Christmas Island explosions could 
            not have harmed British servicemen; further notes the Ministry of 
            Defence's refusal to grant funding to a test pioneered at Dundee University 
            that would determine the effects of radiation on servicemen, and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to demand justice for all test veterans 
            and take action where Her Majesty's Government has failed by granting 
            the £300,000 necessary to carry out these tests.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2593</strong> <strong>Ian Jenkins: Chernobyl Children 
            Life Line Link with the Scottish Borders</strong>-That the Parliament commends 
            the work of Chernobyl Children Life Line, which offers medical help 
            and holidays to young victims of on-going radioactive contamination 
            in Belarus; welcomes the formation of a link between this national 
            charity and the Scottish Borders, and applauds its efforts to bring 
            groups of youngsters to the Scottish Borders for a restorative and 
            life-enhancing stay in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2592#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Continuing 
            Presence of BSE and new variant CJD </strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the continuing presence of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) 
            in Scotland and the growing numbers of cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
            Disease (CJD), including at least two cases in the parliamentary constituency 
            of Eastwood; welcomes the setting up of a National Care Co-ordinator 
            and CJD advice network, but acknowledges the devastating effects this 
            disease can have on victims and their families and believes that the 
            Scottish Executive should give its continuing support to those families 
            affected by this terrible disease.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, 
            Rhoda Grant<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2591#</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Draft Guidance 
            for Home Education</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">is 
            concerned at the Scottish Executive issuing for consultation draft 
            guidance on the circumstances in which parents may choose to educate 
            their children at home, without taking proper account of the views 
            of children and parents affected by this; does not support this action 
            and recognises the considerable alarm its issue has generated within 
            the home education community and the damage which it is likely to 
            cause to relationships between families and education authorities; 
            further recognises the fundamental human rights of parents and children 
            to choose education outwith school and without being obstructed by 
            the state; notes that section 14 of the Standards in Scotland's Schools 
            etc. Act 2000, under which this draft guidance was issued, was introduced 
            to protect home educating families from any harassment or intimidation 
            by education authorities, as evidenced by an independent report from 
            the Scottish Consumer Council; further notes that section 14 was supported 
            by the Parliament on condition that the content of the guidance was 
            fully informed by home educating families; refutes the consultation 
            document's unfounded and insulting inferences that home educated children 
            are in need of extraordinary measures of care and protection due to 
            the exercise of a lawful educational choice which is equally valid 
            to schooling; considers that the guidance exhorts local authorities 
            to act beyond their powers under section 37 of the Education (Scotland) 
            Act 1980 and seeks to condone unlawful breaches of data protection 
            and human rights legislation; believes that the Minister for Education 
            and Young People should apologise to the home education community 
            in Scotland and withdraw the consultation document immediately on 
            the grounds that the Scottish Executive has no authority to approve 
            such breaches, and, in the light of its failure to address the serious 
            issues raised in the Scottish Consumer Council's report and the many 
            concerns of families who will be affected by such guidance, considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should end the discrimination against 
            home educating families in Scotland forthwith by amending the necessary 
            laws to afford them the same legal rights as those families in England, 
            whereby children may be removed from state schools upon a written 
            notification.</a></p>
