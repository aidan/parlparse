<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#fend">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5086</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Marty Layman-Mendonca</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its condolences to the family and friends of US primary school teacher, Marty Layman-Mendonca, who, having been left brain-damaged after being attacked while walking the Great Glen Way near Inverness in July 2006, has sadly died in the United States of America, and recognises the contribution of local people in Inverness and the Highlands who helped efforts to raise funds to pay for Ms Layman-Mendonca to be moved closer to her home.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mrs Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, Alex Fergusson<strong>*</strong>, Alex Johnstone<strong>*</strong>, Dave Petrie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5085</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>White Poppies for Peace in the Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament asks the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to reconsider authorising only one charity, the Earl Haig Fund Scotland (Scottish Poppy Appeal), to distribute red poppies in the Parliament and to allow the Peace Pledge Union fund to distribute white poppies as well; notes that the white poppies for peace first appeared 73 years ago on Armistice Day 1933, calling for conflicts to be resolved without violence and with justice; further notes that, since the end of the Great War, there have been over 300 wars and that the white poppy is a painful reminder of the world&rsquo;s failure to prevent war, and acknowledges that, while the Earl Haig Fund Scotland was founded in 1921 with the aim of providing practical help in time of need to all who served in the armed forces and their dependents, there is still a place for the white poppy as a symbol of remembrance and disarmament, working for peace without violence.</p>
<p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5084</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Clydesdale Bank</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the second anniversary of the alliance between Clydesdale Bank and the Post Office Ltd; notes that to date over 2.3 million transactions, totalling over &pound;500 million, have been made by Clydesdale Bank customers through the Post Office, demonstrating the value of this service, especially to people in rural areas where 60% of villages have a post office but only 9% have a bank branch, and commends Clydesdale Bank for allowing all of its customers to access their money at any of the 1,800 post offices in Scotland, the only major Scottish bank providing a service for its customers and helping to support the post office network in this way.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5083</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Adam Smith to Feature on English Banknotes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to note that the Bank of England is to feature a portrait of 18th century Scottish philosopher, Adam Smith, on its new &pound;20 note; notes that Smith was one of the first to argue the case for a free market economy and that his views are as relevant today as they were during his lifetime; further notes that Smith is the first Scot to be honoured in this way, and welcomes this as an acknowledgement that the United Kingdom as a whole has benefited immensely from a strong political and economic union.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5082</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Lost Children Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that it is 30 years since three-year-old Sandy Davidson disappeared from his home in Bourtreehill, Irvine; notes that it is estimated that a child disappears in the United Kingdom every five minutes, equating to approximately 100,000 children every year and that, according to campaign groups, speed is critical in locating missing children; congratulates Sandy&rsquo;s sister, Donna Davidson, on the launch of her nationwide campaign to help track down the thousands of children who disappear every year in this country; notes that the campaign will involve displaying posters of missing children on 450 vans across the country, and calls on local authorities across the country to aid this campaign in every way possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5081</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Scotland Welcomes the British Transplant Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the British Transplant Games, due to take place in Edinburgh in 2007; congratulates the organisers, the Transplant Sports Association of Great Britain, on highlighting that people who receive transplants can go on to have a full, fit and fulfilling life; urges politicians, business and members of the public to do all that they can to support these games, and looks forward to a highly successful event in Scotland next year.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5080<> </strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>WHSmith and Scottish Publishing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the huge contribution made by literature and the wider publishing industry to Scottish culture and the Scottish economy; notes that the cultural and economic benefits which they provide are particularly important for the capital city, Edinburgh, UNESCO World City of Literature; condemns, therefore, the overly centralised buying system operated by high street bookstore WHSmith from its Swindon headquarters; notes that the company&rsquo;s buying policies result in very few Scottish titles finding their way on to WHSmith shelves; recognises that, as WHSmith has a 20% share of the Scottish consumer book market, its policy of directing all book-buying from outside Scotland has a detrimental effect on Scottish writers, the Scottish publishing industry and the Scottish book-buying public; considers that the Scottish Executive should set up a group to look at the question of asymmetric trading relationships, that is large companies declining to trade with small producers, a relatively common occurrence in Scotland, and further believes that the Executive should draw up a Scottish book retailers code of conduct which ensures that the buying systems of booksellers in this country take into account the distinctive culture and heritage of Scotland and its localities.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5079</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Home Smart</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the home smart campaign by the Scottish Council for Single Homeless (SCSH) and its aim of ensuring that school leavers understand the issues surrounding homelessness and how to avoid it; commends those schools in central Scotland which have committed themselves to participate; values the contribution made by organisations like SCSH in tackling homelessness, and calls for a renewed effort to end homelessness.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5078</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>North Sea Divers&rsquo; Strike</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of 500 deep sea divers in the Rail Maritime and Transport union (RMT) to reject by more than two-to-one the latest United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association pay offer; recognises the extremely dangerous conditions in which these men work, deep in the icy waters of the North Sea, putting their lives at risk to repair oil wells and pipelines in an industry vital to Scotland&rsquo;s economy; believes that it is right that their wages should reflect the great danger of the job; recognises the fact that they must pay out &pound;20,000 for their extensive training; further notes that they can spend half their working week in decompression chambers after working at depths of 600 feet, that they face compulsory retirement at 50 and cannot get life insurance, medical or sickness cover for the extremely hazardous job they do; believes that the &pound;46,000 maximum salary is therefore not excessive, being much less than the salary earned by an MSP, for example, and notes that divers&rsquo; pay has slipped by 20% in recent years in comparison with similar occupations; believes that while the oil industry is making record breaking super-profits it is only right that the highly important and dangerous job these divers do is fully recognised, and calls on the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association to meet RMT representatives at the earliest opportunity to try to settle this dispute to the satisfaction of both sides.</p>
<p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5071</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Supporting Staff at James Watt College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the EIS and Unison members at James Watt College for defending jobs and wages against an intimidatory and bullying style of management from the college board; further believes that the only way to restore good industrial relations at the college is for college Principal, Bill Wardle, to resign, and offers continued solidarity to staff at the college and continues to support their just campaign to protect jobs and wage levels.</p>
