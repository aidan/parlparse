            at Gourock Pier will have rights and obligations to give priority 
            of access to any new operator, including Caledonian MacBrayne, in 
            preference to Western Ferries (Clyde) Ltd, who already have their 
            own existing berthing facilities at Hunter's Quay and McInroy's Point, 
            if such a new operator wished to compete against Western Ferries (Clyde)

            Scottish Executive whether, if it could be proved as a result of an 
            updated analysis of costs and revenues that an unsubsidised vehicle-carrying 
            ferry service between Gourock and Dunoon would be viable, it would 
            invite expressions of interest from operators who might be interested 
            in providing such an unsubsidised service.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8067</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To
