<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3877#</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Air Ambulance Trials in Orkney</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposal of the Scottish Ambulance Service to replace the Kirkwall-based BN Islander aircraft, successfully used for many years to provide air ambulance cover for Orkney, with an Inverness-based EC 135 helicopter which also covers a much wider area of the Highlands and Islands and beyond; further notes that trials of the helicopter on service in Orkney, carried out since spring 2005, have done little to provide assurances that it can provide even an equal level of service to that provided by the Islander aircraft, with particular concerns relating to its ability to fly in Orkney&rsquo;s winter weather and also its ability to provide adequate cover for the wide area it will be required to serve, and believes that, if the Kirkwall-based Islander aircraft is not retained as a back-up facility beyond the end of March 2006, Orkney will be left with poorer quality and potentially unsafe air ambulance cover.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3876&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Treatment in Ayrshire and Arran</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the most recent guidance issued by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), which recommends the use of the drugs donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine for use in the treatment of people with moderate Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in England and Wales; whilst welcoming this decision, regrets that no similar commitment has been made in respect of the availability of such drugs for people diagnosed with mild Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; is disappointed that memantine has not been recommended for use at all, despite clinical evidence to suggest that it can benefit patients who have reached the severe stages of the disease; recognises the benefits of continued therapeutic and specialist nursing care in assisting Alzheimer&rsquo;s sufferers to manage their condition; agrees that initiatives such as that implemented recently by NHS Ayrshire and Arran, whereby at least two nurses on all acute wards are trained specifically to manage patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, are an effective means of aiding sufferers and their families; but believes, nonethelesss, that donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine should be available to sufferers of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in Scotland; is aware that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) will now take the final decision on whether to allow these drugs to be prescribed in Scotland and therefore urges QIS to go further than the NICE recommendations and recognise the role and experience of clinicians and GPs in assessing the needs of the estimated 62,000 people in Scotland who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and calls for a degree of flexibility and discretion to be available to such practitioners in the prescribing of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine, dependent on their evaluation of individual cases.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3875</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with the PCS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends solidarity greetings to members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union taking strike action in defence of public services, their jobs and to resist privatisation; recognises that 15,000 jobs in the Department of Work and Pensions have already been eroded, leading to one million calls for help, with benefits going unanswered, eight-week delays for vulnerable people entitled to benefits, pensioners and those most in need not being able to travel required distances to centralised offices and frustration and anger compromising the health and safety of workers; commends the PCS for its constructive attempts to negotiate a solution; recognises that members have no alternative but to strike; believes their employers, the UK Government, should seek meaningful talks and take action to reverse the cuts, centralisation and privatisation, and, until that happens, wishes every success to the members of the PCS in their action.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3874</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Parliament Election Process</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the certainty resulting from the statement in the House of Commons&nbsp;on 24 January 2006 by the Secretary of State for Scotland that there will be no changes to the election process ahead of the Scottish Parliament elections in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3873</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Tinnitus Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the British Tinnitus Association and the RNID for working together to organise National Tinnitus Week from 20 to 26 February 2006 to raise public awareness of tinnitus, make people with tinnitus aware of the assistance available at hospitals around the United Kingdom, encourage more sufferers to seek help, bring the condition to the attention of those at risk of tinnitus and help to ensure that more GPs are informed about the services and information available to them and their patients.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3870.1</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Future Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3870) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &quot;electricity&quot; to end and insert &quot;energy for Scotland must include development of all types of renewable energy within a publicly owned, publicly accountable energy company; considers that the energy policy must be based on the needs of Scottish communities and not on the profits of big business, and believes that energy production, distribution and usage must be carried out in a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable manner and that as such, nuclear power must never be considered in any energy policy.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3870.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Future Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3870) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &quot;with interest&quot; to end and insert &quot;that Scotland is an energy rich nation; rejects calls for investment in new nuclear power stations in favour of accelerating the development of our renewables potential and emerging clean technologies; notes that, contrary to the impression given by many commentators, Scotland is a gas exporter and consumes only one-eighth of gas produced, and believes that the Parliament requires the political powers to determine our own energy future and ensure that our energy resources benefit the people of Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3870.3</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Future Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3870) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges that electricity makes up only around 20% of Scotland&rsquo;s total demand for energy; recognises government figures showing that a safe and secure mixture of practicable renewable technologies, combined with achievable energy efficiency measures, mean that Scotland needs not face an energy gap; notes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s findings that simple energy efficiency measures could save Scottish businesses &pound;1.3 billion per year, thereby improving their competitive advantage; believes that nuclear power remains uneconomic, unsustainable, unsafe and ultimately unnecessary, and calls on the Executive to use existing devolved powers to increase investment in energy efficiency and emerging renewable technologies, particularly micro-renewables, as part of a safe, secure and sustainable energy policy for Scotland.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3870.4</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>Future Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3870) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the development of a wide range of renewable energy technologies in Scotland as a key element of a balanced energy supply mix; supports the Executive&rsquo;s target that 40% of electricity generated in Scotland by 2020 should come from renewable sources; looks forward to publication of the revised Scottish Climate Change Programme and the consideration given to the contribution of energy efficiency and renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions; endorses the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to tackling fuel poverty; acknowledges the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to not support further development of nuclear power stations while waste management issues remain unresolved; welcomes the forthcoming release of the first two volumes of the Scottish Energy Study; recognises the importance of the UK energy review, and supports the Executive&rsquo;s engagement with the UK Government, Ofgem and the energy industry to ensure that the future energy supply needs of Scotland are met.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3863.1</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>The Economy of the East of Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3863) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes with regret the announcement by Lexmark that it intends to close its factory in Rosyth with the loss of 700 jobs; expresses sympathy for the workers affected; is concerned about the impact the closure will have on the economy of Dunfermline and West Fife; believes that, in response to the closure, an action plan targeted at assisting the Lexmark workforce should be introduced immediately; further believes that the Scottish Executive, in conjunction with Fife Council, should put in place, as a matter of urgency, a strategy for the economic revitalisation of Dunfermline town centre and that Transport Scotland should be directed to improve the transport links to the area in order to make it more attractive for investors; agrees that, as part of a package to help the economy of Fife, an immediate announcement freezing the level of tolls on the Forth Road Bridge at &pound;1 should be made, and further agrees that planning for a new crossing should begin immediately in view of the fact that the bridge will close to heavy goods vehicles in 2013 and to all traffic in 2019 if a satisfactory engineering solution cannot be found to overcome the bridge&rsquo;s structural problems.&quot;</p>
