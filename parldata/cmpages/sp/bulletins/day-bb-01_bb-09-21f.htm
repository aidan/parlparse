          <p><strong>*S1M-2243#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the prevalence of the mainly inherited heart 
            disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) which affects one in 500 
            of the population and is the number one cause of sudden death among 
            under 25-year-olds; congratulates the Cardiomyopathy Association on 
            its role in highlighting the condition and acknowledges the work of 
            those involved in the association who have often suffered the loss 
            of a family member because of HCM; further notes the Cardiomyopathy 
            Association's campaign to secure screening by electrocardiogram and 
            echo ultrasound of all first degree relatives of those who die as 
            a result of this condition, and believes that the Scottish Executive, 
            in partnership with the Health and Community Care Committee, the National 
            Health Service and relevant groups working in this field, should consider 
            how best those suffering from this condition might be identified and 
            given access to the appropriate treatment.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2242</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes: NHS Staff</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the valuable contribution made by all staff working within 
            the NHS in Scotland, without whose efforts, skills and commitment 
            the NHS could not function; commits itself to ensuring that all staff 
            there are properly valued; welcomes the Scottish Executive's commitment 
            to making improvements in the education, training and career development 
            opportunities for NHS staff, together with more family friendly and 
            flexible working practices, and further welcomes plans to involve, 
            through partnership forums, NHS staff representatives in the new unified 
            NHS boards.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2241#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie: Fair Trade Movement</strong>-That 
            the Parliament endorses the work of the fair trade movement in ensuring 
            decent wages and conditions for workers in developing countries; congratulates 
            the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) for ensuring that 
            the Parliament offers fair trade tea and coffee to members and staff, 
            and believes that the SPCB should now take steps to extend the range 
            of fairly traded products.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2240#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie: Deaf Awareness Week, 8-14 October 
            2001</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its support for the British 
            Deaf Association's Deaf Awareness Week from 8 to 14 October 2001; 
            notes that there are approximately 800,000 deaf or hard of hearing 
            people and 6,000 users of British Sign Language (BSL) in Scotland; 
            further notes that an average of 84 babies are born in Scotland every 
            year with permanent deafness, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should maximise the opportunities for deaf children to be educated 
            in the medium of BSL and bring forward proposals to incorporate BSL 
            into the modern language curriculum within schools in Scotland.</p>

            children.</p>
