          <p><strong>*S3M-639</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>100 Years of Scouting</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Council of the Scout Association on the centenary of the Scout Movement being celebrated throughout 2007, on the level and commitment of volunteers to the delivery of the scouting programme in all 32 local authority areas and on the contribution made by scouting to the lives of young people in Scotland and worldwide; recognises the contribution of scouting to non-formal and outdoor education and applauds the commitment to engaging young people in decision-making through its Voice for Young People initiative and the participation of 120 young people in its recent annual conference; notes that the 1st Glasgow Scout Troop was the first officially recognised Scout group in the world; notes also the achievement of Carrie Gibson, a Scout leader from Greenock, on being the first person ever to have scaled Mount Everest through scouting as part of the Scottish Scouts 7 Summits Expedition; welcomes the work put into the &pound;2 million centenary 7 on Appeal to help put scouting on a solid footing for the next centenary; is concerned at the difficulties that the major youth organisations have in accessing capital development funding; applauds the increase in membership across all sections of the Scouts in Scotland, and believes that scouting continues to make a major contribution to the development of citizenship and leadership and to life-enhancing opportunities for young people in Scotland and across the world.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-638</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Thornhill Road Post Office</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the proposal to close Thornhill Road Post Office in Falkirk; notes that the decision to close the post office network in many of our communities is as a direct result of the policy pursued by the Labour government at Westminster; acknowledges that Thornhill Road Post Office is a vital community asset for the people of Middlefield, and calls on the UK Government to recognise that these continual cuts in the post office network have the greatest impact on the most vulnerable people in our community.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-637</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Closure of Falkirk Tourist Office</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of VisitScotland and Falkirk Council to close the tourist office in the centre of the town and move it to the Falkirk Wheel; believes that this decision is wrong as visitors to Falkirk will now have to travel several miles in order to access the local tourist office; recognises that tourist numbers to the Falkirk area have grown significantly over the last few years, and believes that the existing tourist information centre should be retained with an additional information centre at the Falkirk Wheel.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-636</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Protection of Green Spaces in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the action by Glasgow City Council in including in the planning brief for the sale of Anniesland College&rsquo;s Balshagray Annexe a small piece of green space owned by it at Broomhill Avenue, Glasgow, without consulting local residents or councillors and without regard to the need to protect and enhance green space in the city; supports the campaign by Broomhill Avenue Conservation Group to retain the green area for the local community, and urges the council to give higher priority to supporting recreational and green spaces in the city.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-635</strong> <strong>Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>Changes to the National Concessionary Travel Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Government urgently to review the national concessionary travel scheme to extend eligibility to disabled people in receipt of the lower rate of disability living allowance and to older and disabled people using community transport in rural areas, and to consult on other desirable changes to the scheme.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-634</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Gratias Agemus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the significant contribution made by Mr David Shanks to promoting the teaching of Latin, Greek and classical studies in Scottish schools; marks his three decades teaching at Selkirk High School; congratulates him on his retirement and wishes him well for the future, and notes with affection the influence he has had, for good or ill, on at least three current members of this Parliament.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-633</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>North West Women&rsquo;s Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vital contribution made by the North West Women&rsquo;s Centre to the lives of women in the city of Glasgow; notes the work done by the centre to support and encourage women, often when they are at their most vulnerable, and expresses concern that the centre is once again facing an uncertain future due to a shortfall in core funding.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-632</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Vale of Leven Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament rejects current proposals to downgrade Vale of Leven Hospital; commends the excellent work done by local campaigners who organised and participated in a highly successfully march attended by some 20,000 concerned local residents expressing their understandable opposition to the running-down of their community&rsquo;s hospital; acknowledges that the campaign to maintain Vale of Leven Hospital&rsquo;s current service levels continues unabated following the success of the march; congratulates Ms Vivien Dance of Hospital Watch on co-ordinating a petition, signed by 13,000 members of the local community, calling on the proposal to remove services from Vale of Leven Hospital to be rejected, and urges the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to use the powers she has to ensure that these proposals are indeed rejected as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-631</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Holodomor, the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that it has been over 70 years since the events of the Ukrainian famine of 1932-33, known as the Holodomor; also notes that there are various estimates of how many died as a result of this famine but that even conservative estimates place this number in the millions; further notes that there is a strong body of opinion that considers the events of the Holodomor were in fact a deliberate policy of the Stalin regime of the time and that these constitute an act of genocide; acknowledges that a number of countries now recognise the events as genocide; commends the work of those campaigners working to raise awareness of the events of the Holodomor, including the Holodomor Memorial website and holodomor.org.uk, and passes its condolences to the relatives of victims of the Holodomor, which is marked by an official day of remembrance on 26 November in Ukraine.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-630</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Optimism in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent YouGov Scottish opinion poll, which finds that the First Minister Alex Salmond is more popular among Labour voters in Scotland than the Labour leader in the Scottish Parliament, Wendy Alexander MSP, by 25% to 20%, and more popular among Liberal Democrat voters than Scottish Lib Dem leader, Nicol Stephen MSP, by 26% to 14%; further notes that 63% of Scots in the same poll believe that the First Minister is doing a good job compared to just 25% who disagree, and believes that the hugely positive attitudes of people in Scotland to the Scottish Government is explained by a further poll finding that more people believe that the Scottish National Party is optimistic about Scotland&rsquo;s future than all of the other parties added together.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-629</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Young Runaways</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that each year thousands of children under 16 years from all parts of Scotland and every social background, for a multitude of different reasons, run away from home; is concerned that young, vulnerable runaways are at high risk of being physically or sexually abused; welcomes the report <em>A Scoping Study of Services for Young Runaways</em>, funded by the Scottish Government and published by 1 in 9 - The Scottish Coalition for Young Runaways, and notes the findings of the report and the need for (a) a nationally consistent method for the collection of basic data around young runaways, (b) the establishment of inter-agency protocols throughout Scotland which describe how each agency responds to young runaways, in particular those who run away from home, as recommended by Scottish Executive Guidance, &quot;Young Runaways&quot; in 2003, (c) return home welfare interviews for young people who, having run away, return home, to assess need and help access support and advice if required, (d) services that provide preventative and continued support for young runaways and (e) a network of safe emergency accommodation, including refuge, to ensure the safety of young runaways and providing them and their families with ongoing support.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-596*#*</strong> <strong>Angela Constance:</strong> <strong>Concessionary Travel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that disabled people in receipt of the low rate mobility component of disability living allowance (DLA) are not eligible for concessionary travel; is deeply alarmed about the detrimental impact on disabled people who this year have had to re-apply for concessionary travel and who have subsequently lost eligibility; recognises that the national concessionary travel scheme replaced local schemes such as those operated in West Lothian and the Strathclyde area that included those in receipt of DLA low rate mobility component; acknowledges that DLA low rate mobility component is a benefit for people who, due to the nature of their disability, require support or supervision to travel; notes that many people with mental health problems or learning disabilities will not qualify for concessionary travel under the mental health legislation due to high thresholds and bureaucracy and, furthermore, that this exclusion contravenes recommendations and the spirit of the Same as You guidance, and therefore *considers that* the national concessionary travel scheme *should be reviewed and that* Capability Scotland and Enable Scotland *should be supported* in their campaign to extend eligibility for concessionary travel to those in receipt of DLA low rate mobility component and free travel for their companions, and to make it easier for disabled people to qualify where they are not in receipt of DLA or eligible under mental health legislation.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-561</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Alcohol and Pregnancy: A Dangerous Cocktail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is aware of the dangerous impact of alcohol on pregnancy, with miscarriage, stillbirth and pre-term delivery among many possible effects; welcomes the recent publication of the British Medical Association (BMA) report, <em>Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, A Guide for Healthcare Professionals</em>; notes that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a severe condition which impairs brain functions and can lead to physical abnormalities among children; supports BMA recommendations for further research into FASD; believes that the Scottish Government should consider the implementation of guidance and training of healthcare professionals on the prevention, diagnosis and management of FASD at the earliest practical opportunity; is aware that six out of 10 mothers drink alcohol while pregnant, many of whom are unaware of the danger to their unborn child, and therefore asks the Scottish Government to raise public awareness of this issue and to provide clear health advice that alcohol should not be consumed during pregnancy, while ensuring that any revision of guidance on alcohol consumption should contain specific advice on the risk of FASD and other side effects in pregnancy.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-561.1</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Alcohol and Pregnancy: A Dangerous Cocktail</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-561) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out from first &quot;pregnancy&quot; to end and insert &quot;some pregnancies, with miscarriage, stillbirth and pre-term delivery among many possible effects; welcomes the recent publication of the British Medical Association (BMA) report, <em>Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, A Guide for Healthcare Professionals</em>; notes that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a severe condition that permanently impairs brain and nervous system functions and can lead to physical abnormalities among children; supports BMA recommendations for further research into FASD; believes that the Scottish Government should consider the implementation of guidance and further training of healthcare professionals on the prevention, diagnosis and management of FASD at the earliest practical opportunity; is aware that six out of 10 mothers drink alcohol while pregnant, many of whom are unaware of the danger to their unborn child; asks the Scottish Government to raise public awareness of this issue and to promote the Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s health advice that alcohol should not be consumed during pregnancy, while ensuring that any revision of guidance on alcohol consumption should contain specific advice on the risk of FASD and other side effects during pregnancy, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with Scottish-based alcohol producers to encourage them to provide information to consumers about the associated risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy following the example set by alcohol producers in both France and America.&quot;</p>
