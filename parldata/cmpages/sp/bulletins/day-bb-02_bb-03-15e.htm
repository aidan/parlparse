          <p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by 
            the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information 
            to the Parliament.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24124</strong> <strong>Kay Ullrich:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive whether it will arrange for the trunk road maintenance 
            contractor to carry out the alterations to the signage on the A78 
            trunk road at West Kilbride and Seamill, as detailed in the North 
            Ayrshire Council drawings submitted to the Deputy Minister for Enterprise, 
            Transport and Lifelong Learning by Councillor Elizabeth McLardy on 
            12 March 2002. </p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24125</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what plans it has for the development of the 
            service provided from the Procurator Fiscal Service office in Stranraer.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24128</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what specific funding it has made, or plans 
            to make, available to Highland NHS Board for audiology services and 
            for the recruitment and training of NHS staff for the diagnosis and 
            fitting of digital hearing aids to patients in the area.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24133</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-23591 
            by Dr Elaine Murray on 7 March 2002, whether the annual Scottish award 
            for the best publicly funded building will be awarded this year; what 
            consultation there will be as to whether an award should be granted 
            this year; whether the award will be open to those buildings in respect 
            of which a certificate of completion is granted in the year of the 
            award and, if not, what other criteria will be applied for eligibility 
            for nomination.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24134</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how effective it is for an issue to be included 
            within the national priorities in education, given the view expressed 
            in paragraph 23 of its Policy Memorandum on the Education (Disability 
            Strategies and Pupils' Records) (Scotland) Bill that the inclusion 
            of accessibility strategies in these priorities &quot;would carry 
            little weight&quot;.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24135</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how the view expressed in paragraph 23 of its 
            Policy Memorandum on the Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils' 
            Records) (Scotland) Bill that the inclusion of accessibility strategies 
            in the national priorities in education &quot;would carry little weight&quot; 
            is reconciled with the view expressed in the letter of 16 May 2000 
            from the then Deputy Minister for Children and Education to the Secretary 
            of the Gaelic School Planning Group that the inclusion of Gaelic in 
            the priorities was probably the most significant achievement ever 
            for Gaelic medium education.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24136</strong> <strong>Mr John McAllion:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what the average waiting time has been

            for use of a powered wheelchair in (a) 1999-2000, (b) 2000-01 and 
            (c) 2001-02 to date.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24137</strong> <strong>Mr John McAllion:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive whether there have been any reductions 
            in the frequency of assessment clinics for the use of powered wheelchairs 
            at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee and what assessment has been made 
            of the health impact of any such reductions.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24138</strong> <strong>Mr John McAllion:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive how many patients in the Tayside NHS board 
            area were waiting to be assessed for the use of a powered wheelchair 
            at 31 January in (a) 2000, (b) 2001 and (c) 2002.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24139</strong> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> To ask 
            the Presiding Officer whether MSPs will have access to, and be able 
            to use, computer facilities at their desks in the debating chamber 
            at Holyrood. </p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24140</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to the supplementary 
            question from Karen Whitefield to question S1O-4829 by Cathy Jamieson 
            on 7 March 2002, whether it will outline the detail of its plans for 
            improving and upgrading social work training.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24141</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to the supplementary 
            question from Alasdair Morgan to question S1O-4829 by Cathy Jamieson 
            on 7 March 2002, what will form the basis of its forthcoming national 
            and local strategies to address the issue of social worker recruitment 
            and retention.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24142</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S1O-4829 
            and S1O-4736 by Cathy Jamieson on 7 March 2002 and 28 February 2002 
            respectively, whether its forthcoming plans and strategies regarding 
            social workers will address (a) a review of payscales and other terms 
            and conditions, (b) meaningful supervision and support, (c) restricted 
            caseloads, (d) training and development opportunities and (e) increased 
            access to resources.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24143</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how many people are currently diagnosed as 
            suffering from osteoporosis.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24144</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive what support it is giving to National Science Week 
            and Science Year.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24145</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it will make any additional assistance 
            available to Highlands &amp; Islands Airports Ltd in order to enable 
            the company to reduce the standard tariff landing charges at Inverness 
            Airport and, if so, whether such assistance will enable such charges 
            to be reduced to the levels of airports at Glasgow, Edinburgh or London 
            Heathrow. </p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24146</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether a reduction of landing charges at Inverness 
            Airport would support promotion of the tourism industry and, in particular, 
            increase the number of visitors travelling to Inverness Airport.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24147</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask
