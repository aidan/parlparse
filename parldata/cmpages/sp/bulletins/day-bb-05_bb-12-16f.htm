<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3745</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>ChildLine Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates ChildLine, who last year helped over 30,000 vulnerable children; notes that it was unable to answer another 22,500 calls from vulnerable and lonely children; recognises the need for both financial and practical aid; further notes the plans for ChildLine to join the NSPCC next year and for ChildLine Scotland to join the NSPCC&rsquo;s sister organisation, Children 1ST; notes, however, that in Scotland, of the 170 children that call each day, counsellors can help only a little over half of these threatened young people; supports the proposal for ChildLine Scotland to join Children 1ST, and agrees that everything should be done to support those of our children who are lonely and vulnerable, especially at Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3744#</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the many opportunities to improve community safety provided under the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 and other initiatives, such as Safer Routes to School; congratulates community safety partnerships, such as that in Fife, for the innovative ways in which they have developed local schemes; notes that initiatives, such as Fife&rsquo;s Time2Act Safer Neighbourhoods campaign, cover a wide range of community safety matters such as safety of older people, women&rsquo;s personal safety, reduction in domestic violence, drink driving and drunk pedestrians, safety of children and young people, safer town centres and neighbourhoods and support for victims of crime and anti-social behaviour; acknowledges the work done by public sector staff, uniformed services and many members of local communities to develop and support such schemes; believes that there is further scope for developments in this area, and considers that all concerned should continue to work together to make Scotland&rsquo;s communities safer.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3743</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Welcome Decision of Edinburgh Council Tenants to Reject Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of City of Edinburgh Council tenants to vote against housing stock transfer; believes the decision of 53% against to 47% for the transfer represents a victory for people power against all the odds and is a hammer blow against the privatisation of public housing provision throughout Britain, and demands that the &pound;1 billion, which was apparently available for privatisation, should now be available to write off the council&rsquo;s housing debt, to invest in improvements to the existing housing stock and to build 6,000 affordable, quality, publicly owned houses that the city badly needs.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3742</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Northfield Girls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Emma Thomson, Lynsey White, Krista Cairns and Kimberley Ingles from Northfield in Aberdeen for their great achievement in winning first prize at the National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Awards, sponsored by Kids Club Direct and Scottish Power Learning, in Glasgow on 10 December 2005 and recognises the excellent work carried out by the young girls who provide the Northfield Community Disco and play at various community venues on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3740</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> *<strong>Climate Change College*</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Edinburgh University Students&rsquo; Association President, Ruth Cameron, has won a competition organised by WWF, ice-cream makers Ben and Jerry, and polar explorer, Marc Cornelissen, to become an international speaker on climate change; further notes that Ms Cameron beat more than 1,000 other candidates from across Europe to win one of the six places at the &quot;Climate Change College&quot;; congratulates Ms Cameron on her success, and wishes her well at her training session in Greenland in the spring.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3735*#*</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Closure of Six Post Offices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern over Post Office Ltd&rsquo;s announcement that it will be closing six town centre post offices, including the main post office in Dumfries, replacing them with franchises in SPAR shops; notes that SPAR itself is a franchise; is concerned over the implications for staff numbers and terms and conditions of employment; believes that in cases such as Dumfries the new location is less convenient for customers; further believes that the proposed arrangements may not offer a sustainable and long-term future for these post offices; expresses concern that the announcement was made less than two weeks before Christmas and considers that Post Office Ltd should extend the consultation period beyond the current seven weeks to ensure that all customers get the opportunity to express their views, and believes that no irreversible decisions should be made without paying full consideration and attention to the views of customers and staff.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3732*#*</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Childhood Obesity in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at recent findings published by NHS Scotland which suggest that the proportion of Scottish children who are overweight, obese and severely obese is far higher than anticipated in all age groups and is twice that of the expected UK average; recognises this means that more than a third of our 12-year-olds were considered to be overweight last year, 19.4% were considered to be obese and 11.2% severely obese; accepts that these figures represent a potential time bomb for the NHS in terms of the future costs of the treatment of obesity and related illness; acknowledges the commitment by the Scottish Executive to tackle this problem; considers that more robust measures are needed, such as investing further in the promotion of breastfeeding as the healthiest start in life, removing unhealthy dietary choices from our school environments and increasing the focus and commitment to physical activity in our schools; acknowledges that examples of best practice exist, such as South Coatbridge&rsquo;s Healthy Lifestyle Project, and believes that, in light of these findings, a national debate is needed to re-examine all possible options and means of making progress on this issue.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3656*#*</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Scottish Children and Fuel Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that there are approximately 10,000 fuel poor households with children with a poor energy efficiency rating and 5,000 households with children in fuel poverty with no central heating, including households in the Scottish Borders; notes that this equates to approximately 46,000 children living in fuel poverty; further notes that for every 5% increase in fuel prices a further 30,000 more households go into fuel poverty and that gas and electricity prices continue to rise against the background of a predicted severe winter, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency and as a first step, extend the central heating programme to those 5,000 households at a cost in the order of &pound;1.6 million against a budget of &pound;97 million for the existing central heating programme and thereafter consider extending the programme to ensure that no Scottish child suffers from the consequences of fuel poverty.</p>
