<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4739 Brian Adam: Scotland against Continual Fuel Duty Hikes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great concern the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s plans to increase fuel tax by two pence per litre; also notes that this is far from the first hike in fuel duty under the current administration; is concerned that these increases are causing growing inflation on the price of groceries and other goods due to high shipping costs, and calls on the Chancellor to take measures on behalf of the haulage industry, Scottish business and the Scottish people, to forego the tax increase and to bring forward measures to create more stability in the Scottish financial sector.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4738 Margaret Mitchell: Deafblind Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the work of Deafblind Scotland, which seeks to enable Scots who are both deaf and blind to receive the support and recognition that they require to be equal citizens; notes with concern the difficulties faced by deafblind people in freely accessing public transport due to the varying restrictions placed by local authorities on concessionary travel for that guide communicators who provide professional communication and guiding support, and therefore believes that all relevant bodies must work together to ensure deafblind citizens can enjoy full access to public transport.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4737 Stuart McMillan: Winter is Looming so Time to Contact The Energy Saving Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the winter months are nearing in Scotland and considers that it is vital that people, especially those on low incomes and older people, contact the Energy Saving Trust to ascertain what assistance is available to them to tackle fuel poverty; notes that the Energy Saving Trust, which manages the Energy Assistance Package on behalf of the Scottish Government, takes an integrated approach to tackling fuel poverty by reducing high fuel costs through giving advice on social tariffs and improving the energy efficiency of properties through advice, insulation and heating measures; further notes that there is a free telephone advice line that people can contact on 0800 512 012 to seek assistance, and urges all constituents who are concerned about the winter months ahead to contact the advice line as soon as possible.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4736 Ms Wendy Alexander: Lance Armstrong Cycles into Paisley</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent visit of seven-times winner of the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong, to Paisley and his invitation to local cyclists to join him; further notes that he issued the invitation via his Twitter page which led to between 200 and 300 riders, including cycling star Graeme Obree, joining this Renfrewshire cycle; welcomes the very positive publicity for Paisley brought about by this impromptu visit, and hopes that it will encourage others to visit local attractions like Paisley Abbey, Weaver&rsquo;s Cottage in Kilbarchan and the Lochwinnoch RSPB reserve.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4735 Sandra White: Rangers Charity Foundation Teams up with Glasgow Old People&rsquo;s Welfare Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement from the Rangers Charity Foundation that the Glasgow Old People&rsquo;s Welfare Association (GOPWA) will be its new community charity partner for season 2009-10; acknowledges that the support that GOPWA provides, such as its heat-and-eat service, which gives older people the opportunity to get out and socialise with one another before being safely returned home, is essential in maintaining and enhancing the wellbeing of many older people, and believes that the generosity of the Rangers Charity Foundation, which will help to provide a dedicated bus for this invaluable service, will ensure that many older people continue to benefit from this excellent service.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4727 Ken Macintosh: The Life of Ernest Levy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament pays tribute to the life of Ernest Levy, holocaust survivor and inspiration to successive generations; admires the warmth and humanity that characterised Ernest&rsquo;s teachings despite the brutalising experience and inhumanity that he suffered at the hands of the Nazis; feels privileged that, after leaving his native Hungary, Ernest chose to make Scotland his home; believes that his more than 40 years here has made our country a richer place; is grateful for the countless times that Ernest selflessly made himself available to talk to young and old about the horrors of the holocaust despite the toll recounting his years in Auschwitz-Birkenau and the other death camps took on him; recognises the contribution that Ernest made as cantor of the Giffnock and Newlands congregation, the love that he gave and received from his own family, the respect in which he was held in the wider community and the impact that he had on all who met him, and thanks Ernest for a life that could so easily have been cut short but instead has shone like the single light that gave him hope and inspiration at a time of hate and prejudice.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4724 Mr Frank McAveety: Daily Record&rsquo;s Gie&rsquo;s a Game Campaign Helping Unemployed Footballers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>Daily Record</em> for its Gie&rsquo;s a Game campaign to help unemployed footballers by creating a database of footballers looking for work and clubs seeking players; welcomes the successes in the campaign, with Jim Duffy using the database to recruit a striker for Brechin City; notes with concern the record number of unemployed footballers at the moment, and calls on the Scottish Government to do all it can to assist the campaign and work to help those footballers who find themselves out of work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4723# David Stewart: Insulin Pump Therapy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the benefits that insulin pumps have for people with type 1 diabetes in assisting with the condition; notes that between 4% and 14% of people with type 1 diabetes meet the criteria for eligibility for insulin pump therapy under current clinical guidance; notes the variation in financial provision across NHS boards for insulin pump therapy, whereby in Fife funding has been allocated for 10 pumps per year, whereas in Highland there is no separate budget despite all NHS boards having received funding for access to insulin pumps; further notes the differences in waiting times for eligible patients whereby in Lothian the average waiting time including waiting for training and education is estimated to be around 12 months and in Grampian and Orkney the current waiting time is six months; notes with concern the low level of insulin pump usage in Highland, which, at 0.9%, is the second lowest in Scotland, after Ayrshire and Arran; believes that further steps are required to monitor NHS boards to avoid a postcode lottery for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, and looks forward to renewed commitment to action on diabetes in Scotland in 2010 and beyond.</p>
