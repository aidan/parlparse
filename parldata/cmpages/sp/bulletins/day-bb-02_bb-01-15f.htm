          <p><strong><a id="2606" name="2606"></a>*S1M-2606</strong> <strong>Mr 
            Kenny MacAskill: Scotland's Railways</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that the Executive's neglect and lamentable lack of vision and 
            strategy for Scotland's railways has contributed to a deterioration 
            of rail services in Scotland to the point at which they have become 
            amongst the worst in Europe; further notes that the Strategic Rail 
            Authority's new strategic plan offers nothing new for Scotland; believes 
            that Scottish railways must be fully controlled by, and accountable 
            to, the Scottish Parliament, and therefore calls upon the Executive 
            to take responsibility for delivering a strategy for the running and 
            operation of Scotland's rail network.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2605</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Retain Clive 
            Fairweather</strong>-That the Parliament considers it to be in the 
            interests of justice and human rights that Clive Fairweather remains 
            as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland, and would 
            be deeply concerned had he wished to remain but any unjust interference 
            were found in whether his contract is renewed when it expires as Mr 
            Fairweather has been an exceptional watchdog in his outspoken honesty 
            and soundness of judgement on the state of Scottish Prisons; believes 
            that vulnerable prisoners, and staff concerned about conditions, depend 
            upon the integrity of Mr Fairweather who has used honest language 
            in condemning matters affecting human life such as the high rate of 
            suicides in prisons and in highlighting slopping out as a breach of 
            human rights, and has worked diligently both to protect the public 
            and to attempt to reform prisons, and calls upon all concerned in 
            this appointment under a Royal Warrant, including Her Majesty The 
            Queen, to ensure fairness prevails in appointing a key guardian in 
            the justice system.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2604</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Treatment of al-Qaeda 
            Prisoners of War</strong>-That the Parliament, while utterly condemning 
            the terrorist activities of al-Qaeda, deplores the refusal by the 
            United States of America to classify Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners 
            as Prisoners of War, thus denying their basic human rights as set 
            out under the Geneva Convention, and recognises that this kind of 
            action could lead to further acts of terrorism and is ultimately detrimental 
            to any attempts to reduce the threat of terrorism around the world.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2603#</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Holyrood Project 
            Goods and Services</strong>-That the Parliament considers that goods 
            for the Holyrood Project should not be sourced from states currently 
            failing to comply with any resolutions of the United Nations.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="2602"></a>*S1M-2602</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: 
            Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>-That 
            the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill, agrees 
            to the following expenditure out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund-</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>(a) expenditure of the Scottish Administration in consequence of 
            the Act; and</p>
          <p>(b) increases attributable to the Act in the sums payable out of 
            that Fund under any other enactment.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2601#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: United Nations 
            World Summit on Sustainable Development</strong>-That the Parliament 
            supports the attendance of the First Minister at the United Nations 
            World Summit on Sustainable Development (Rio+10) in Johannesburg, 
            South Africa in September 2002 in order to represent the Scottish 
            people, to report on the progress being made in Scotland towards implementing 
            the Rio agreement and to demonstrate continuing commitment to this 
            issue. </p>
