          <p><strong>*S2M-1005</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Non-Domestic 
            Rate (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>-That the Local Government and 
            Transport Committee recommends that nothing further be done under 
            the Non-Domestic Rate (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/59).</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1004</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Westminster 
            Committee on GM Crops</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the publication 
            of the Westminster Environmental Audit Committee's report, <em>GM 
            Food - Evaluating the Farm Scale Trials,</em> and its conclusion that 
            the commercialisation of genetically modified (GM) crops on the basis 
            of the results of the farm scale trials would be irresponsible and 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to endorse this view and uphold the 
            precautionary principle in relation to GM crops.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1003#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Crisis 
            for Borders Schools</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the proposed closure of the following Borders schools: Cranshaws, 
            Teviothead, Eccles/Leitholm, Hutton, Roberton, Ednam, Channelkirk, 
            Newlands, Oxnam, Glen Douglas, Heriot and Fountainhall; further notes 
            that Scottish Borders Council in its consultation document <em>Management 
            Review of the School Estate in the Scottish Borders</em>, in particular 
            the chart describing the factors that may be considered when making 
            decisions on the schools' long-term viability, did not include the 
            &quot;importance of the local school to the community&quot; which 
            had been included in the first stage evaluation; reminds the Scottish 
            Executive of its commitment in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> 
            to &quot;continued reform so that our public services are designed 
            and delivered around the needs of individuals and the community within 
            which they live&quot; and also its commitment in <em>Building our 
            Future Scotland's School Estate</em> to place &quot;the child at the 
            centre, meeting the needs of the individual&quot; and &quot;the school 
            at the heart of the community, meeting the needs of the communities&quot;; 
            believes that the proposed closures, against the expressed wishes 
            of many communities, are driven by the requirements of proposed PPP/PFI 
            school building programmes, and therefore believes that the Executive 
            should adhere to its aforesaid commitments and reject rural school 
            closure proposals which, if they proceed, will permanently damage 
            fragile communities.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1002#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Wild 
            Scottish Venison</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the world-class 
            quality of wild Scottish venison as a healthy, nutritious, low-fat 
            product; notes with concern the financial difficulties facing the 
            sector in light of critically low prices, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should undertake a study into how the promotion and marketing 
            of Scottish venison may be improved and the industry supported.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1001#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>International 
            Women's Day</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 8 March 2004 is 
            International Women's Day and salutes the struggles of women throughout 
            history and all over the world for a fair and democratic society; 
            further notes the contribution that women in struggle make to the 
            fight against women's oppression and for women's equality and liberty; 
            notes that the struggle is being carried on today by, amongst others, 
            the nursery nurses, the vast majority of whom are women, and considers 
            that they are deserving of victory.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1000#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Situation 
            of Asylum Seeker Hunger Strikers</strong>-That the Parliament condemns 
            the current immigration policies of Her Majesty's Government which 
            force refugees such as Farouk Haidari, Farnborz Gravindk and Mokhtar 
            Haydary to take such drastic action as sewing up their mouths and 
            going on hunger strike for 15 days rather than face deportation; notes, 
            with great concern, that two of the refugees have now been found unconscious 
            and hospitalised, and, in view of the severity of the current situation, 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should contact the Home Office 
            immedately and intervene on behalf of the refugees.</P>

            Situation Regarding Asylum Seekers Hunger Strike</strong>-That the 
            Parliament expresses its grave concern at today's developments in 
            relation to Farouk Haidari, Farnborz Gravindk and Mokhtar Haydary, 
            the Iranian Kurdish asylum seekers who are conducting a hunger strike, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should exert every possible 
            avenue of influence to avoid even more grave consequences for the 
            health of all three men and to resolve the issues that have precipitated 
            the hunger strike.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-998</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Intemperate 
            Remarks of Donald Gorrie MSP</strong>-That the Parliament views with 
            dismay the comments made by Donald Gorrie MSP at the Fraser inquiry 
            on 3<SUP> </SUP>March 2004 in relation to the late First Minister, 
            Donald Dewar MSP and the Holyrood project; considers that the remarks 
            made by Mr Gorrie were intemperate, inaccurate, deeply offensive and 
            uninformed; deplores Mr Gorrie's attempt to pass off as measured criticism 
            a stream of impolitic utterances which bear no relation to the true 
            nature and character of the man who gave years of distinguished and 
            selfless public service in the cause of his Anniesland constituents 
            and the people of Scotland, both at Holyrood and Westminster, and 
            agrees that an apology followed by a period of lengthy silence from 
            Mr Gorrie is much to be desired on this matter.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-997#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Proposed 
            Closure of AA at Erskine</strong>-That the Parliament views with serious 
            concern the decision taken by the Automobile Association (AA) to close 
            its renowned Scottish headquarters in Erskine, Renfrewshire; believes 
            that the AA's loyal and hard working employees deserved much better 
            than this from an employer for whom they have given such fine service, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its good offices 
            in order to persuade the AA to stay in Renfrewshire.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-996</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>International 
            Women's Day - Trafficked Women</strong>-That the Parliament recognises, 
            during International Women's Week, the plight of women who are trafficked 
            for the purposes of prostitution and work in the sex industry; further 
            recognises that the expansion of the EU may exacerbate the problem 
            of identifying and supporting women who are so trafficked; notes the 
            extreme difficulties faced by trafficked women seeking to escape prostitution 
            and their particular vulnerability under immigration law, whereby 
            they may be returned to dangerous and life-threatening situations, 
            and urges the Scottish Executive to conduct research to determine 
            the number of trafficked women in Scotland and to consider establishing 
            dedicated refuge and support services for such women.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-995</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Nature

          <p><strong>S2M-994#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Report 
            on Responses to Prostitution</strong>-That the Parliament notes and 
            welcomes the report <em>A Critical Examination of Responses to Prostitution 
            in Four Countries</em>, commissioned by Glasgow Routes Out Social 
            Inclusion Partnership; welcomes the contribution it makes to the debate 
            on strategies to tackle prostitution; recognises that the report provides 
            evidence that legalisation or regulation of prostitution does not 
            create any safer an environment for women involved in prostitution 
            and that the Swedish approach, where there are legal penalties for 
            those men who create the demand for prostitutes, offers a realistic 
            alternative; welcomes the report's evidence that highlights the importance 
            both of protecting women and of challenging those men who use prostitutes; 
            confirms that prostitution is a form of abuse and that all strategies 
            must understand the importance of recognising and tackling this abuse, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive Working Group on Prostitution 
            should take proper account of this report's findings in its deliberations.</P>

            skin cancer awareness project &quot;Keep Yer Shirt On&quot;, designed 
            to raise the awareness in children of the need to protect skin from 
            ultraviolet (UV) light and, in particular, welcomes their partnership 
            with the relevant councils to encourage pre-school establishments 
            to adopt sun awareness policies which include the prevention of future 
            cases of skin cancer through the continued education of young people

          <p> <strong>S2M-991</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>A

            Shipbuilders, Port Glasgow, for winning the contract to build a vessel 
            for the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency; believes that ministers 
            and the officials of the agency, by placing this important order with 
            the Port Glasgow shipyard, have shown a commendable confidence in 
            the men and women who are employed at the yard, who rightly have an 
            excellent reputation for the building of first-class, specialist ships, 
            and looks forward to the yard securing other such orders in the years 
            to come.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-990</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Ofgem 
            Scottish Office</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes Ofgem's recent 
            announcement that the Ofgem office in Scotland is central to its efforts 
            to protect the interests of Scottish gas and electricity consumers 
            and calls on Ofgem to work with the Scottish Executive to ensure that 
            Scotland's targets for renewable energy, energy efficiency and fuel 
            poverty can be met at the earliest opportunity and at the lowest cost 
            to consumers.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-988</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Higher 
            Education in the Borders</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the 
            very high standard of education provided in the Scottish Borders and 
            the high percentage of school leavers that enter into further and 
            higher education; welcomes the applications for major investment in 
            the further education sector for the redevelopment of Borders College, 
            which will provide state-of-the-art facilities in Galashiels, Hawick 
            and wider access in all other parts of the Borders; congratulates 
            the college and other partners, including Heriot-Watt University, 
            on their partnership working; expresses serious concern, however, 
            that Heriot-Watt University may wish to withdraw textile design courses 
            from the Netherdale Campus and relocate these to Edinburgh, and expresses 
            further concern that such a move would be wholly detrimental to the 
            partnership working that has developed and damaging to the creation 
            of a centre of excellence in education in Netherdale for both further 
            and higher education, founded on 130 years of provision of training 
            and education in textiles.</P>

            the historic events of the 1984-85 miners' strike which began 20 years 
            ago this month; believes that, looking back, it was not only the most 
            bitter political division in post-war Britain but also a turning point 
            in politics, and believes that the defeat of the National Union of 
            Mineworkers, after a brave and heroic struggle, ushered in two decades 
            of unremitting attack on the rights of working people, their trade 
            unions, their employment rights and their communities and had far-reaching

          <p><strong>S2M-981</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Support

            pre-school education and care that nursery nurses deliver to Scotland's 
            children; notes that their pay has not been reviewed for a considerable 
            length of time and that the current pay negotiations have been ongoing 
            for more than three years; regrets that nursery nurses have felt obliged 
            to take industrial action in support of their pay claim; notes that 
            the situation is no closer to being resolved; calls on UNISON and 
            COSLA to redouble their efforts to find a solution and end the dispute, 
            and further calls on the Scottish Executive to intervene to ensure 
            that a national agreement is forthcoming, taking into account the 
            new roles and responsibilities of nursery nurses in delivering national 
            policies for the pre-5 curriculum, early education intervention measures, 
            early identification of children with special support needs and vital 
            support to deliver mainstreaming in education as established under
