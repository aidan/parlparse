          <p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by the

            to the Parliament.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>S1W-21639</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-15753 by 
            Mr Jim Wallace on 11 July 2001, whether it supports the use by the 
            Scottish Law Commission in its report on Boundary Division Walls (Report 
            No. 163, paragraph 1.4, footnote 6) of the case of <em>Robertson </em>v<em> 
            Scott </em>1886 (13R 1127) as being central to its opinion that that 
            case changed the law on march fence type divisions when it concerned 
            a common or mutual gable and when the only question which was put 
            before the court in that case, and the only decision given by the 
            court, was that as a predecessor of a later builder had paid the cost 
            of half the wall, that later builder was entitled to get back a payment 
            he had made by mistake on beginning to use the gable, and what recognition 
            it has given to this decision which established that the wall in question 
            was legally held as common or mutual property &quot;pro indiviso&quot;, 
            as confirmed by Professor Bell in <em>Principles of the Law of Scotland, 
            </em>(10<sup>th</sup> Edition 1899, section 1078).</p>

            legal titles concerning boundary division subjects which are extant 
            and which conform to, and are based on, the legal standing of the 
            subject as set out in <em>Principles of the Law of Scotland, </em>(10<sup>th</sup> 
            Edition 1899, section 1078).</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-21641</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> To ask the

            Mr Jim Wallace on 11 July 2001, what action it plans to take in respect 
            of holders of legal title concerning boundary division subjects which 
            are based on the <em>Principles of the Law of Scotland, </em>(10<sup>th</sup> 
            Edition 1899, section 1078) which confirmed the subjects as being 
            held as common or mutual property &quot;pro indiviso&quot; if such 
            holders' rights and value in their property are affected in adverse 
            manner by an alleged change in the law to ownership only to the mid-point 
            of the subject and how it will address any confusion and inequality 
            amongst such 'pro-indiviso' holders.</p>
