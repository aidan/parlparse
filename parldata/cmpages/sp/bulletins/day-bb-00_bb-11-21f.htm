            Mr Mike Rumbles on behalf of the Standards Committee: Recommendations 
            of the Standards Committee, 4th Report 2000</strong>—That the Parliament 
            agrees the recommendations of the Standards Committee, as set out 
            in its 4<sup>th</sup> Report 2000, on the investigation of complaints, 
            the appointment of a Standards Commissioner and other matters. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1375</strong> <strong>Karen 
            Whitefield: Airdrieonians FC</strong>—That the Parliament congratulates 
            Airdrieonians Football Club on its recent success in winning the Bells 
            Challenge Cup Final, recognises the important role that Airdrieonians 
            FC and other community based clubs play in sustaining and developing 
            community spirit and, in light of its recent financial difficulties, 
            wishes Airdrieonians FC and its fans continued success.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1374</strong> <strong>Irene 
            McGugan: Children's Rights</strong>—That the Parliament notes the publication 
            by the Scottish Alliance on Children’s Rights of the report <i>All 
            Children, All Ages</i> which highlights that, although Her Majesty's 
            Government signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 
            1991, many of the 54 separate international standards are not being 
            complied with, that children’s basic human rights are being consistently 
            disregarded and that many of the problems highlighted in the report 
            are caused by poverty and social deprivation, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to give serious consideration to the findings and recommendations 
            within the report, principally that a Children’s Commissioner for 
            Scotland should be appointed to ensure that children’s rights are 
            a central consideration in any new legislation, that children themselves 
            should have a voice in policy making, that serious consideration be 
            given to a ban on physical punishment and that there be specific and 
            immediate actions to alleviate poverty as well as long- term targets.</font></p>

            welcomes the improvements in the local government finance system proposed 
            by the Executive and agrees that this will provide greater stability 
            and improve accountability and will contribute to the Executive’s 
            aims of revitalising government and ensuring better local services 
            and tax stability for the citizens of Scotland.</font></p>

            MacKay: Salmon Conservation (Scotland) Bill - Financial Resolution</strong>—That 
            the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the Salmon Conservation (Scotland) Bill, agrees to 
            any increase attributable to that Act in the sums payable out of the

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1371</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace 
            Elder: Tribute to the Reverend Adrian Rennie</strong>—That the Parliament 
            pays tribute to the outstanding, devoted and passionate work for Scottish 
            causes carried out by the late Reverend Adrian Rennie of Drylaw Parish 
            Church who has died at the age of 37, having lavished his time and 
            energy upon work for the people of Scotland, ignoring courageously 
            his lifelong heart condition; wishes his family to know how deeply 
            he touched the lives of many, whether from his devoted service to 
            the Iona Community, his church work in the East End of Glasgow, his 
            burning concern for world peace, his chairmanship of the Scottish 
            Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament or his invaluable aid in setting 
            up the Parliament’s Cross Party Anti-Nuclear Group, and wishes to 
            record that in his brief lifespan he achieved more in the fight for 
            social justice than many spared for decades more and proved by his 
            blithe spirit and sparkling humour that human goodness such as his 
            does not equate with dullness. </font></p>
