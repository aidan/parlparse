          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2145#</strong> <STRONG>Elaine Smith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Oxfam Asylum Positive Images Project</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Oxfam on its Asylum Positive Images Project; welcomes the project&rsquo;s aims of promoting accurate, fair and well-informed media coverage of asylum issues; recognises the findings of a recent Mori Poll commissioned by Oxfam which found that more than 83% of people surveyed agreed that individuals seeking asylum in Scotland should be given the opportunity to work; notes that 64% of people maintained that Scotland should be a safe haven for those fleeing persecution and that a further 60% believed that children should not be held in detention centres; acknowledges that these findings illustrate the goodwill that exists towards refugees and asylum seekers in Scotland; considers that the Scottish Executive has a responsibility to recognise, promote and encourage such attitudes as part of the drive towards a more inclusive and tolerant Scotland, and suggests that the continued operation of Dungavel House immigration removal centre undermines this objective.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2144#</strong> <STRONG>Linda Fabiani:</STRONG> <STRONG>Scotland's Nobel Prize Winners</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes those Scots who have become Nobel Laureates since the prize was inaugurated in 1901 and, in particular, notes the contribution of Scotland&rsquo;s first Nobel Laureate, Sir William Ramsay, who received the honour in 1904 &quot;in recognition of his services in the discovery of the inert gaseous elements in air, and his determination of their place in the periodic system&quot; and recognises that the example set by Scotland&rsquo;s Nobel Laureates is an effective generator of confidence and wellbeing.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2143</strong> <STRONG>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</STRONG> <STRONG>Scottish Elephant Polo Team</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish elephant polo team on its success in winning the Elephant Polo World Championships in Nepal and commends the enterprise and adventurous spirit of the team members and their sponsors for promoting Scotland in such an original fashion.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2142#</strong> <STRONG>Rob Gibson:</STRONG> <STRONG>Counterdrift Index</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continued loss of population from rural and island areas and its harmful effects on many communities; believes that the Scottish Executive should create a &quot;Counterdrift Index&quot; that sets out the details of its achievements in tackling this issue, and considers that the index, published quarterly, should flag up all relevant indicators, including the number of affordable houses built and public jobs dispersed to areas of depopulation, the amount of land transferred for community use from both public and private sectors, the number of modern apprenticeships turned into permanent sustainable jobs and incentives delivered for tradespeople to work in the affected areas.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2141#</strong> <STRONG>Cathie Craigie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Eco Schools Programme</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of education in raising environmental awareness; notes the continuing and growing success of the Eco Schools programme, run in Scotland by Keep Scotland Beautiful; encourages the Scottish Executive to give continued support to the programme, and congratulates Whitelees Primary School in Cumbernauld on being the 100th school in Scotland to be awarded a Green Flag.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2140</strong> <STRONG>Mike Pringle:</STRONG> <STRONG>Continued Arms Embargo Against China</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the European Union (EU) on its decision not to lift its arms embargo against China; is disappointed that both Germany and France had called for the embargo to be lifted; notes that the continued embargo is a recognition by the EU of the lack of progress on human rights in China since the brutal massacre of unarmed civilians in Tiananmen Square in 1989, and calls on the UK Government to resist any further attempts within the EU to lift the embargo.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2139#</strong> <STRONG>Cathy Peattie:</STRONG> <STRONG>BBC, Scottish Culture and Economy</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the central role of the BBC in the promotion of Scottish culture and society and coverage of Scottish current affairs and its contribution to Scottish creative industries and the Scottish economy; expresses concern at&nbsp;the recent announcement by BBC's&nbsp;Director-General,&nbsp;Mark Thompson, and subsequently by&nbsp;the&nbsp;Controller of BBC Scotland, Ken McQuarrie, regarding restructuring, cutbacks and outsourcing and,&nbsp;in particular,&nbsp;the implications of this announcement for Scotland,&nbsp;and believes that the BBC&rsquo;s historic obligation to provide high-quality public service broadcasting and its contribution to the economic and cultural life of Scotland should be enhanced,&nbsp;not diminished.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2138</strong> <STRONG>Margaret Smith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Royal Highland and Agricultural Society</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern about the plans contained in the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper, <EM>The Future of Air Transport</EM>, which would require the relocation of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society&rsquo;s headquarters and showground at Ingliston as a result of the proposed expansion of Edinburgh Airport; values the immense contribution that the Royal Highland Centre makes to the Lothian economy, attracting 1.2 million visitors and over &pound;80 million every year; recognises that the centre has not just provided 50 years of the Royal Highland Show, but also accommodates a variety of special events throughout the year, including fairs, concerts, conventions and sporting events; is further concerned by the estimated costs of relocating the centre, which vary between &pound;95 million and over &pound;400 million with further costs to the Edinburgh economy, and encourages the Scottish Executive, the UK Government, British Airports Authority and others to work together to produce a set of proposals which will allow the society to remain at its Ingliston site.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2137</strong> <STRONG>Irene Oldfather:</STRONG> <STRONG>Band Aid 20</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Sir Bob Geldof and the Scottish musician, Midge Ure, for organising Band Aid 20, a re-recording of the 1984 single, <EM>Do They Know It's Christmas?</EM>; applauds the contribution on this recording of all artists, who have given their time free of charge, including Scottish bands, Travis and Snow Patrol; is aware that proceeds of the sales are going towards relief for the Darfur region of Sudan and to combat HIV and AIDS across Africa; notes that more than 300,000 copies of the CD single have been sold in the first week of release alone; acknowledges that the Band Aid Trust has contributed &pound;75 million to famine relief projects across Africa between January 1985 and November 2004; welcomes the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Right Honourable Gordon Brown MP&rsquo;s decision to waive VAT on sales of both the new CD single and the newly-released DVD of the original Live Aid concert in 1985, and encourages as many Scottish people as possible to buy a copy of the CD single and make a difference to the lives of many in Africa this Christmas.</p>
