            Men's and Women's teams on their promotions to Division A of the European 
            Youth Trophy, the Scotland Under-21 Men's and Women's teams for winning 
            their respective Junior Celtic Cup trophies and the Scotland's Women's 
            team for winning the Women's Celtic Cup; notes that both male and 
            female senior teams have qualified for the European Nations Cup finals 
            in Spain in 2003, and wishes them every success.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3365#</strong> <strong>Mr John McAllion: Scottish Gulf 
            War Veterans</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the deep concern 
            over the health conditions of Scottish Gulf War veterans and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should recognise their illness and ensure 
            that they receive the appropriate treatment.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3364</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe: Iraq</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the current situation in Iraq; acknowledges 
            that there is, as yet, no firm evidence that military intervention 
            in Iraq at this stage would have the support of the British public; 
            believes that any military action in Iraq should not take place without 
            a debate in the House of Commons followed by a substantive vote by 
            MPs; further believes that the first priority of Her Majesty's Government 
            must be to ensure the return of the United Nations (UN) weapons inspectors 
            under UN auspices; considers that any further steps in relation to 
            Iraq must be consistent with the rule of international law, and urges 
            the Prime Minister to recall the UK Parliament as soon as he returns 
            from the Camp David summit with President Bush, so that the international 
            situation can be discussed in detail.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3363#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Industrial Relations 
            at Central College of Commerce, Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the poor industrial relations situation at the 
            Central College of Commerce, Glasgow, and, in particular, the sacking 
            of Mr Jim O'Donovan, a lecturer at the college, for alleged gross 
            misconduct; further notes the deep concerns relating to Mr O'Donovan's 
            dismissal with many believing that the charges brought against him 
            were incompetent, and believes that Mr O' Donovan should be reinstated 
            immediately and that the Scottish Executive should undertake an investigation 
            into the situation at the college.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3362#</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan: World Alzheimer's 
            Day - 20 September 2002 </strong>-That the Parliament notes the on-going 
            campaign by Alzheimer Scotland - Action on Dementia, to raise awareness 
            about the early symptoms of dementia and, in particular, World Alzheimer's 
            Day, which will provide a focal point of activity throughout the world; 
            further notes that Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of 
            dementia; recognises the dedicated and valuable work of carers and 
            organisations in seeking to support people with dementia, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive and MSPs should (a) ensure that the needs 
            of the people with dementia are addressed by government departments 
            and committees of the Parliament and promoted among the wider Scottish 
            society and (b) monitor the progress of legislation in order to ensure 
            that local authorities and the NHS are working together to recognise, 
            assess and support people with dementia and their carers.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3361 - Withdrawn</strong></p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3360</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Doors Open Day 
            2002</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the Doors Open Days 2002 
            initiative taking place in September 2002, co-ordinated by the Scottish 
            Civic Trust, which gives people the opportunity to visit and explore 
            for a day, free of charge, various buildings across Scotland such 
            as castles, stately homes and law courts, many of which are not normally 
            open to the public, and believes the initiative gives people the opportunity 
            to improve their understanding of their local architectural environment 
            and the country's rich built heritage.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding, Murdo Fraser</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3359</strong> <strong>Mr John McAllion: Safe Child Scheme</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the Safe Child Scheme launched in Milton of 
            Craigie Retail Park, Dundee; notes that the use of contact cards allows 
            a lost child to be reunited with his or her parents quickly, and further 
            notes that this is part of a wider scheme aimed at providing a safe 
            environment for the community in the east end of Dundee.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3357#</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Importance of Primary 
            Care</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance of primary 
            care in managing 90% of patient contact with the NHS in Scotland; 
            appreciates the vital role GPs play in providing primary care services 
            as part of the wider primary care team; supports the statement that 
            &quot;if it can be done in primary care, it should be done in primary 
            care&quot;, and acknowledges the urgent need for reform and support 
            to invigorate staffing levels, facilities, IT provision and morale 
            for this to become a reality.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3356</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Drug Testing 
            Regime of the International Olympic Committee</strong>-That the Parliament 
            urges the International Olympic Committee to adopt a more rigorous 
            regime that will conclusively and unambiguously identify methamphetamine 
            in tests for banned substances carried out on athletes to ensure that 
            no athlete is automatically banned from competing with the subsequent 
            loss of reputation, earnings and, in the case of Alain Baxter, an 
            Olympic medal which was won fairly and without the use of a performance-enhancing 
            drug, as objective scientific opinion now verifies.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie, Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Mr 
            Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mr Lloyd Quinan<strong>*</strong>, Brian Fitzpatrick<strong>*</strong>, 
            Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3355</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Erskine Hospital</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the management and staff at Erskine Hospital 
            for the creation of the excellent Erskine Bursary Scheme which, in 
            co-operation with other care providers, will ensure that former servicemen 
            and women will receive first-class care in care homes near to their 
            families, friends and communities and believes that Erskine Hospital 
            stands alongside the very best of care providers for service veterans 
            and sets a benchmark for such services in relation to those who have 
            served in the armed forces and who in retirement deserve no less.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3354#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Crisis in Borders 
            Public Sewerage System</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            that there is no further capacity in water waste treatment works in 
            some towns and villages in the Scottish Borders such as Duns, Earlston, 
            Lauder, Newtown St Boswells, Stow, Peebles and West Linton; further 
            notes that, as a consequence, developments are being delayed or restricted 
            and that Scottish Water's current investment programme will be unable 
            to resolve some of these issues until, for instance, 2004-05 in Peebles 
            and 2005-06 in Earlston, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should, as a matter of urgency, convene a meeting with representatives 
            of Scottish Borders Council, the Chief Executive of Scottish Water, 
            the Water Commissioner for Scotland and relevant MSPs.</p>

            Services Ombudsman Act 2002 (Amendment) Order 2002</strong>-That the 
            Transport and the Environment Committee recommends that the Scottish 
            Public Services Ombudsman Act 2002 (Amendment) Order 2002 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3352#</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Support for Crofting 
            in the Highlands and Islands</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            importance of crofting to the Highlands and Islands; welcomes the 
            publication of the White Paper on crofting reform and encourages crofters 
            to participate in the consultation now underway; further notes the 
            level of agricultural returns to crofting businesses and supports 
            the agri-environmental focus that the Environmentally Sensitive Area 
            scheme has brought to many crofting counties, and encourages continuing 
            support to crofting through such measures as the Crofting Counties 
            Agricultural Grants scheme. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone, John Farquhar Munro, Donald Gorrie</p>

            and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>-That 
            the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland)

            Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3348#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Opposition to 
            Invasion of Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament is opposed to the invasion 
            of Iraq by USA forces and believes that the Prime Minister should 
            try to dissuade President Bush from such action, which would do incalculable 
            damage to the cause of peace in the Middle East and would almost certainly 
            destroy the lives of many innocent Iraqi people who are victims of 
            the oppressive regime of Saddam Hussein.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Margo MacDonald, Elaine Smith, Robin Harper, Mr 
            John McAllion, Fiona McLeod, Donald Gorrie, Mr Adam Ingram</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3347#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler: Iraq</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that a war against Iraq would result in an 
            enormous loss of innocent lives and could provoke a wider war in the 
            Middle East; is of the view that public opinion, both at home and 
            abroad, is overwhelmingly against such a war, and believes that the 
            Scottish Executive should make representations to the Prime Minister 
            to urge him to dissociate himself and Her Majesty's Government from 
            military action against Iraq, which is not sanctioned by the United 
            Nations Security Council. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop, Elaine Smith, Donald Gorrie</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3343</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: Abolition of the 
            Record of Needs System</strong>-That the Parliament notes the genuine 
            fears of parents and organisations over the proposed abolition of 
            the Record of Needs system for children with special educational needs; 
            expresses concern that the alternative proposal of a &quot;Co-ordinated 
            Support Plan&quot; has not been clearly defined; believes that the 
            &quot;Co-ordinated Support Plan&quot; will result in a reduction of 
            legal rights for children and their parents; further expresses concern 
            that local authorities are not required to carry out a fully comprehensive 
            series of assessments and that &quot;Co-ordinated Support Plans&quot; 
            can only be reviewed every three years, and proposes that consideration 
            be given instead to retaining and improving the current Record of 
            Needs System. </p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3340#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Unauthorised Transfer 
            of Supplier by Energy Companies</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the number of complaints from energy consumers in Scotland 
            who are erroneously transferred from their chosen energy supplier 
            without their consent; recognises the distress and financial detriment 
            this can cause; welcomes energywatch's Stop Now campaign, aimed at 
            introducing solutions to this problem; further welcomes the action 
            already taken by the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government 
            on this matter, and believes that it would be beneficial to consumers 
            if a system is introduced which protects consumers from being transferred 
            without their prior knowledge and explicit consent and that individuals 
            affected by erroneous transfers should receive compensation from the 
            energy supplier.</p>

            of Glasgow's East End in expressing profound thanks to Mr Billy Connolly 
            for his magnificent effort in raising funds for the East End flood 
            victims; is mindful of the time he gave up for free to play the SECC 
            on three successive nights to packed audiences and how his gesture 
            raised not only funds but also the hearts of people in Glasgow left 
            with no possessions after devastating flooding, and salutes this international

            (Amnesic) Shellfish Poisoning) (Orkney) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 2002,

          <p><strong>S1M-3325#</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Ferry Services to 
            the Northern Isles</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the on-going situation surrounding the transfer of the contract for 
            ferry links to the northern isles; recognises that these services 
            provide a crucial lifeline for island communities and businesses, 
            particularly the agriculture and fishing industries, through a substantial 
            volume of passenger and freight transport, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should ensure that ferry links between the mainland, 
            Orkney and Shetland are maintained into the future.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3210#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie: Causing Death 
            by Dangerous Driving</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            the publication of the report by the Transport Research Laboratory, 
            <em>Road Safety Research Report No.26, Dangerous Driving and the Law,</em> 
            which examines the use and application of the law on careless and 
            dangerous driving throughout the UK; supports the report where it 
            states that in Scotland a "clearer message regarding the seriousness 
            of these offences would be sent to both defendant and society if all 
            causing death by dangerous driving cases were tried in the High Court" 
            rather than sheriff courts, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should (a) commission specific Scottish research in this area to take 
            on board the report's conclusions and recommendations and (b) take 
            the necessary steps to ensure that dangerous driving offences are 
            heard in the appropriate court and not downgraded.</a></p>
