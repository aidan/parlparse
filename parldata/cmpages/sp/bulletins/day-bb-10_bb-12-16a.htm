<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Labour Party Debate: Winter Resilience&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <strong>S3M-7604 Andy Kerr: Winter Resilience</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that lessons have to be learned about how the Scottish Government and its agencies react to exceptional weather conditions; considers that MSPs must now look ahead and work together to ensure that all possible measures are taken to prevent the experience of recent weeks, which saw older people trapped in their homes, schools shut, people stranded on roads, businesses losing money, diesel and food supplies running low, mail undelivered and bins not collected; calls on the Scottish Government to improve communications, ensure closer and effective liaison with all appropriate organisations and consider more robust planning exercises, and, while acknowledging that severe weather will cause disruption and delays, believes that Scotland needs to keep moving regardless of the weather conditions. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-7604.2 John Swinney: Winter Resilience</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7604) in the name of Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;, and acknowledges the significant efforts made by a wide range of public service workers, voluntary organisations and people across Scotland to maintain essential services, support their neighbours and keep communities moving through the extreme conditions.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-7604.1 Jackson Carlaw: Winter Resilience</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7604) in the name of Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;, and further calls on the Scottish Government to give consideration to a traffic-light style graded system of severe weather warnings.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-7604.3 Jeremy Purvis: Winter Resilience</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7604) in the name of Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;; regrets the damaging economic and reputational impact of the severe disruption to Scotland&rsquo;s roads, rail services and airports and the Scottish Government&rsquo;s poor handling of the exceptional weather conditions; recognises that difficulties are ongoing; believes that there are several practical steps that could be taken to help avoid such disruption in the future, including for Transport Scotland to carry out more comprehensive scenario planning, for rail operators to review the preparedness of the network and their communication with passengers and for the Scottish Government to facilitate closer co-operation between trunk road operators, the police service and local authorities in their efforts to keep essential routes open and the public advised, and believes that the Scottish Government should outline the measures that it is taking to rebuild confidence in Scotland&rsquo;s ability to remain open for business under adverse weather conditions.&quot; </p>

    <p> <strong>S3M-7490 Anne McLaughlin: UKBA&rsquo;s Contempt Agenda for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the UK Border Agency (UKBA) for its actions that, it believes, imply a complete lack of respect for the Parliament and the people of Scotland; deplores what it considers to be the chaotic and unfeeling manner in which hundreds of asylum seekers in Glasgow were informed of the cancellation of UKBA&rsquo;s contract with Glasgow City Council and their subsequent imminent removal to elsewhere in Scotland; condemns, in particular, UKBA&rsquo;s decision, following a review, to continue, in its view, to refuse to engage with members seeking to represent constituents; believes that this policy is unique among all UK and Scottish governmental agencies, and considers that both examples demonstrate contempt for asylum seekers, the Parliament and Scotland. </p>

<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Government Debate: Antisocial Behaviour Framework&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <strong>S3M-7605 Fergus Ewing: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the first annual report of progress made in implementing the antisocial behaviour framework, <em>Promoting Positive Outcomes: Working Together to Prevent Antisocial Behaviour in Scotland</em>, which shifts the emphasis onto prevention and early, effective intervention while recognising that enforcement measures are appropriate in some circumstances; welcomes the support for this approach from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA), the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (SOLACE), the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS), the Chief Fire Officers Association in Scotland (CFOAS), the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration (SCRA), the Association of Directors of Social Work (ADSW), the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), Youthlink, the Judicial Studies Committee, Victim Support Scotland, Safeguarding Communities Reducing Offending (SACRO), the Scottish Youth Parliament, academia and the third sector; further welcomes the &pound;20 million being invested in Scotland&rsquo;s communities through the Cashback for Communities initiative, which provides free activities for young people, and further notes the progress made across a range of areas in improving community safety. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-7605.3 James Kelly: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7605) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;which shifts&quot; to end and insert &quot;; regrets, however, that it has taken 20 months to publish the report and that it will be 2012 before a proper evaluation of the framework is complete;  believes that this demonstrates a complacent attitude on the part of the Scottish Government toward antisocial behaviour; recognises that antisocial behaviour continues to blight the lives of many throughout Scotland, as witnessed by the 240,696 antisocial behaviour offences recorded in the Scottish Policing Performance Framework annual report of 2009-10; regrets that the number of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBO) granted fell from 437 in 2006-07 to 249 in 2009-10 despite the number of complaints increasing, and calls on the Scottish Government to adopt a more proactive attitude in tackling antisocial behaviour and to listen to the views of local people and support a policy of giving community councils and properly constituted residents groups the power to apply to local authorities for an ASBO.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-7605.1 John Lamont: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7605) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;the progress made&quot; to end and insert &quot;that, while progress is being made across a range of areas in improving community safety, the public must continue to be encouraged to report antisocial behaviour and that where examples of good practice exist these should be replicated as widely as possible.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-7605.2 Robert Brown: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7605) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;; believes that local policing is key to community safety; notes the work underway through the Sustainable Policing Project on protecting frontline policing and the delivery of outcomes for communities, and believes that community safety is unlikely to benefit from the establishment of a single Scottish police force.&quot; </p>

  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em> Parliamentary Bureau Motions&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-7611 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Committee Remit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the remit of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee be amended to&mdash;</p>
  <p>To consider and report on (a) matters relating to transport and infrastructure falling within the remit of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth and (b) matters relating to climate change falling within the remit of the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Members&rsquo; Business: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-7259 Johann Lamont: Support for Children in Family and Friends Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that there is estimated to be a minimum of 13,400 children in kinship (family and friends) care in Glasgow and throughout Scotland; understands that three out of four of these families are living in poverty and that kinship care is frequently the best form of early intervention as well as a longer-term option for children requiring non-parental care, particularly for those who have experienced multiple traumas; notes that kinship care is estimated to save the Scottish Government and local authorities &pound;536 million per year in reduced care costs; considers with regret that the Scottish Government, the UK Government and Scottish local authorities have not yet been able to ensure provision of adequate financial, educational and other supports for children looked after by kinship carers; considers that there is currently insufficient joint working across all levels of government, and believes that kinship care provision is best developed with the involvement of kinship carers themselves as part of the decision-making process and that this would ensure that all policies are based on the needs of the child and that there is no discrimination of kinship carers based on their legal status or postcode. </p>
