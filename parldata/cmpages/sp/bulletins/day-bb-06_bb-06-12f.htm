<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4530#</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Royal Victoria Hospital Site</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes NHS Lothian&rsquo;s decision to relocate the majority of its geriatric in-patient beds to the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, as part of its Improving Care: Investing in Change programme, where modern facilities are better placed to provide quality care for older people; seeks the best possible provision of care for the elderly services in Lothian; acknowledges the current range of measures being put in place to ease parking and congestion problems for visitors and residents in the vicinity of the Western General; believes that the current site of the Royal Victoria Hospital remains ideally located for the provision of a range of care for the elderly services, including adapted housing, clinics, a care home and day-hospital facilities for the benefit of older people in north-west Edinburgh, and believes that NHS Lothian should consult fully and effectively with Edinburgh residents and key local groups such as Queensferry Churches Care in the Community Project, Pilton Elderly Project and the Almond Mains Initiative to determine their priorities and the perceived needs of older people in the capital and how the Royal Victoria site might be used to meet these needs.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4529</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Protecting the Red Squirrel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the UK-native red squirrel is in decline and notes that Scotland is home to over 75% of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s red squirrel population, an estimated 120,000 red squirrels; understands that the non-native grey squirrel, with a population of over 2.5 million in the UK, has displaced the red squirrel and is continuing to threaten and encroach on red squirrel territory; fears that the red squirrel will eventually become extinct in the wild in the UK unless action is taken to greatly reduce grey squirrel numbers, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive must explore all options to reduce the grey squirrel population in borderline areas with the red squirrel population, including offering bounties for capturing or killing grey squirrels in order to safeguard the future of the red squirrel.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4528</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes:</strong> <strong>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Facilities Management Contract</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to bring its facilities management contract back in-house from December 2006, which will see 500 catering, portering, domestic and security staff return to the NHS team; congratulates UNISON Scotland and all other trade unions involved for their work on behalf of their members in this matter; notes that this will bring to an end the concept of a &quot;two-tier&quot; workforce in Glasgow Royal Infirmary by ensuring that all staff are entitled to NHS pay and conditions, thus entitling them to more holidays, better pay, more family-friendly workplaces and access to the NHS pension scheme, and believes that this decision will have a positive effect on patients as well as staff morale.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4527</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Kelburn Brewery on Cart Blanche, Champion Beer of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, occupying the site of a former brewery, notes the importance of beer to the Scottish economy and particularly recognises the value of microbrewers to their local area; welcomes the Campaign for Real Ale&rsquo;s 4th Scottish Traditional Beer Festival back to Edinburgh, and congratulates the Kelburn Brewery of Barrhead on producing Cart Blanche, the Champion Beer of Scotland.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>S2M-4526</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Procurement Advice for School Buildings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that good design and management of school buildings can produce distinct advantages for pupils&rsquo; health and learning; accepts that many local authorities have poor procurement procedures and ignore the best advice from the Scottish Executive provided in a wide variety of planning advice notes, and calls on the Executive to consider what steps it should take, including introducing higher regulation standards, to address the situation.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4525&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>National Bed Assessment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde now has responsibility for a population of approximately one million; considers, therefore, that an urgent assessment is required of all numbers of beds, including high dependency and intensive care beds and those set aside for barrier nursing, since availability of every type of bed is crucial to the best clinical decisions and nursing care, as well as to the smooth and easy flow of the patient journey from one area of a hospital to another as their medical condition changes for better or worse; recognises that not having appropriate beds of any kind, in any speciality at any one time, can mean that a patient may have to stay in intensive care longer than necessary and thus block a bed for a patient who should be transferred from a high-dependency bed or theatre to an intensive care unit bed; acknowledges that delays to admission from casualty, accident and emergency or trauma departments may also be due to a lack of all types of beds being available, thus resulting in the discharge of patients in the evening in order to free a bed for an emergency admission; recognises that important elective procedures and operations may have to be cancelled at short notice as a result of no appropriate bed being available because of a general bed shortage, and therefore, in the light of an increasingly ageing population with more complex conditions and in anticipation of a further rise of medical admissions including all types of infections, in particular MRSA, winter and summer vomiting viruses which often close wards, considers that work should done to address our present problems within such a large NHS board and as a result decrease waiting times and lists.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4524</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with Venezuelan Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern over the situation regarding the Venezuelan company, Drogueria Race, which has sacked two workers, Andry Key and Jhonny Coronil, for organising the SUPROFARD trade union; notes that this trade union has been recognised by the Venezuelan Ministry of Labour and that the company must therefore grant recognition to the union in accordance with the constitution of the Venezuelan Bolivarian Republic; is concerned that the management is trying to introduce a company union in order to impede the workers&rsquo; rights to organise collectively; further notes that the workers have called for international support and solidarity for their case through the Hands Off Venezuela campaign; calls on the Venezuelan Ministry of Labour to intervene in the case and instruct the company to reinstate the sacked workers and recognise the SUPROFARD trade union with immediate effect, and offers solidarity to the workers in their struggle and to the continuing process of the socialist Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela.</p>
