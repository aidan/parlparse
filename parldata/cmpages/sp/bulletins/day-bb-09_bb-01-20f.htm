<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3250</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Common Agricultural Policy Health Check</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, noting the recent agreement in the Council of Ministers on the European Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposals for the Health Check of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), acknowledges the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to work with stakeholders on how key aspects of the proposals should be implemented in Scotland and on the longer-term implementation of CAP in Scotland and believes that future decisions must reflect the distinctiveness of agriculture in Scotland and support a dynamic and competitive industry with farmers playing their full part in achieving the Scottish Government&rsquo;s purpose of sustainable economic growth through food production and the environmental management of our agricultural land, combined with the delivery of other economic and social public goods.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3249</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>First Twenty Years of Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 20 January 2009 marks the 20th anniversary of the employee buy-out of Grampian Regional Transport; further notes that from this First Bus and subsequently First Group was formed, which is now a global transport company employing 135,000 people and with over 2.5 billion passengers a year; also notes the building of a new global headquarters in Aberdeen, which is due to be finished this year; believes that this is a success story of Scottish business, and wishes First Group all the best for the next 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3248</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Welcoming The New Possilpark Health Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &pound;82 million announced by the Scottish Government for community health facilities; notes that &pound;21.5 million of this will be spent in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area; congratulates all those involved in all successful bids, including the bid to secure &pound;9 million of funding towards rebuilding Possilpark Health Centre, which will now be located on a purpose-built campus beside a range of other community services; also notes that this will enhance the working environment for staff and the facilities and services available to patients; believes that this can drive much-needed local regeneration within the area; welcomes the partnership working of a number of agencies to secure this funding, and pays particular tribute to Dr Mandeville, a GP at Keppochill Practice within the current Possilpark Health Centre, who has dedicated much of his career to helping the local community and campaigning for a new purpose-built health centre in Possilpark.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3247</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Robert Burns 250th Anniversary Commemorative Stamps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the terms of motion S3M-01215 (Commemoration by Royal Mail of the 250th Anniversary of the Birth of Robert Burns), lodged by Willie Coffey MSP on 24 January 2008; welcomes the announcement by the Royal Mail that it is to produce two first class stamps to commemorate this important anniversary; notes that the beautifully designed stamps depict the famous Alexander Naismith portrait of Burns and the bard&rsquo;s most famous and enduring line &quot;A man&rsquo;s a man for a&rsquo; that&quot;; further notes that in recognition of his significance, not just in Scotland but around the world, Burns is the only person outside the Royal Family to feature in three special stamp issues, in 1966, 1996 and now in 2009, and welcomes the announcement by the Royal Mail as a contribution to the growing momentum behind the Year of Homecoming 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3246</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Lothian Buses&rsquo; Passengers are Paying More for Less</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses dismay at the increase in all fares offered by Lothian Buses that took effect on Sunday 18 January 2009, particularly the increase to &pound;1.20 for an adult single ticket and &pound;3.00 for an adult day ticket; also voices disappointment at the accompanying reduction in the frequency of the bus service to routes across the capital; believes that the measures will contribute to discouraging the use of public transport across Edinburgh and fails to help promote buses as a cheaper, more convenient and cleaner alternative to car use; notes the difficulties faced by bus companies across Scotland due to the fluctuations in the price of oil last year and believes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s failure to increase the Bus Service Operator&rsquo;s Grant (BSOG) in line with fuel duty further exacerbated these difficulties, and calls on the Scottish Government to act to avoid bus fare increases and reduced services across Scotland, particularly given the economic pressures on bus passengers due to the current economic downturn.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3245&diams; </strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Road Haulage Industry in the South of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision by Stobart Group to close its chilled haulage operation based in Larkhall in the South of Scotland region; further notes that this is the latest of several closures and bankruptcies to affect the haulage industry in the region; considers that the industry has been hit particularly hard by the high cost of fuel, and further considers that road hauliers should be supported during the economic downturn.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3244</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>School Shelters</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of outdoor facilities for young people at school; believes that, while it is important that newly built or refurbished schools have state-of-the-art facilities internally, more attention should be paid to the landscaping of the grounds within the overall school campus; notes that Scotland enjoys more than its fair share of inclement weather and that pupils are often unable to take breaks outside in the fresh air, causing congestion in the school building, such as occurs at Hermitage Academy in Helensburgh; accordingly believes that shelters should be an integral part of the outdoor facilities in school campuses so that pupils can enjoy the outdoor area, and calls on the Scottish Government to include this in any guidance issued to local authorities about the design of the school estate.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3243</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Falkirk Gaelic Forum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the success of the Royal National Mod 2008 in Falkirk; notes that following this successful event the Falkirk and District Gaelic Forum has been established, and welcomes that the forum will work in conjunction with local and national agencies in promoting all aspects of Gaelic and Highland culture in the Falkirk area.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3242</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>West Whitelawburn Housing Co-operative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates West Whitlawburn Housing Co-operative on the near perfect results obtained in its recent tenant satisfaction survey, with over 90% approval ratings in all categories; recognises the contribution made by the office-bearers, committee, staff and members of the co-operative in transforming the quality of housing and environment in the local community and supporting the build-up of innovative local services and projects; notes the positive contribution made by the co-operative model, and looks forward to continuing success in the years to come.</p>
