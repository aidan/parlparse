<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7159 Patrick Harvie: Otago Lane Environmental Impact Assessment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the submission from Woodlands and Park Community Council (WPCC) to the Scottish Government, which raises the lack of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the proposed residential development at 65-77 Otago Street and Otago Lane, Glasgow; understands that the site is within both a green corridor and a conservation area and therefore considers that an EIA is imperative; shares the WPCC&rsquo;s view that the assessment made by the consultant on the size of the development and its impact on the area is contradictory, contains ambiguous language and fails to demonstrate that an EIA is not needed; is concerned that the issues of flooding, drainage, water quality and the development&rsquo;s impact on wildlife have not been adequately addressed; urges the planning committee at Glasgow City Council not to accept the developer&rsquo;s argument that an EIA is not necessary, and calls on the Scottish Government to provide a sympathetic and timely response to WPCC&rsquo;s concerns.</p>
<p>Supported by: Pauline McNeill<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7158 Patrick Harvie: Crosshill Post Office</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the decision taken by the Post Office to move Crosshill Post Office on Victoria Road, Glasgow, to Cathcart Road, Glasgow, is regrettable, given what it considers to be the excellence of service, ease of access for pedestrians, better transport links and purpose-built building of the existing site; sympathises with those post office employees who are now uncertain of their job security; considers that too many of Scotland&rsquo;s post offices are being closed down, and calls on the Post Office to take full account of the views of local users of Crosshill Post Office, many of whom, it believes, strongly oppose the proposed move.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7157 Lewis Macdonald: The Future of Scotland&rsquo;s Supported Employment Workplaces</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy that every public body should aim to have at least one contract with a supported factory or business, as set out in its <em>Social Issues in Public Procurement</em> guidance document in October 2007 and reiterated as part of the <em>Scottish Sustainable Procurement Action Plan</em> in October 2009; welcomes this approach as the most effective means of public policy support for the sector; regrets the lack of evidence that this policy has been effectively pursued over the last three years, and calls on the Scottish Government to set a timetable for every public body in Scotland for which it is responsible to have at least one contract with a supported factory or business.</p>
