    the Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive to draw up and issue new guidelines to
    improve housing energy efficiency in both the public and private rented sectors and in the
    privately owned sector which include requirements that (a) at point of sale owners are
    entitled, as part of the Executive's proposed &quot;Seller&#146;s Survey&quot;, to have
    access to a home energy profile based on National Home Energy Rating (NHER)
    specifications, (b) NHER energy audits are carried out on change of occupation in both the
    public and private rented sectors and (c) the guidance on the Tolerable Standard is
    amended to include a minimum level of provision for affordable heating within a property;
    commends local authorities on innovative initiatives such as the Edinburgh Rewarm project
    and asks the Executive to revise its Home Energy Conservation Act (HECA) 1995 guidance to
    require local authorities to appoint a dedicated HECA officer to co-ordinate all domestic
    energy initiatives in each locality, and urges the Executive to acknowledge its
    responsibilities under Climate Change Protocols and its own commitment to end fuel poverty
    by 2007 by identifying new targets and funds required to meet these targets and by setting
    up a fuel poverty advisory group, chaired by a newly appointed home energy efficiency
    champion, to prepare recommendations on the elimination of fuel poverty by 2007 and
    co-ordinate policy and funding in the domestic sector.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-704#</b> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Slopping Out in Scottish Prisons</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament agrees that urgent action must be taken in the 21st century to end
    &quot;slopping out&quot; at affected Scottish prisons, particularly Barlinnie Prison,
    Glasgow which is 90% without basic sanitation; acknowledges that Barlinnie cannot start
    its third century with this stomach churning and degrading practice continuing and that
    the practice of emptying chamber pots around five times a day is not only inhumane for
    prisoners but for also for staff who supervise and who deplore the practice; notes that
    Barlinnie&#146;s high international status as an innovative prison and its excellent
    rehabilitation work is impaired seriously by the time consumed by slopping out, with
    around 400 staff hours a day wasted away from essential rehabilitation work with prisoners
    due to the security need to be on duty at sluice rooms, and urges that the money removed
    from the Scottish Prison Service budget for the Drugs Enforcement Agency must not result
    in any delay to plans to end slopping out as feared by prison officers.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-703</b> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Rural Shops</strong>&#151;That the

    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-702</b> <strong>Christine Grahame: Public Register of Approved Carers</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with concern that police checks for those working as carers of the

    should be remedied as a matter of urgency and that, following adoption of such a policy, a
    public Register of Approved Carers should be established. </p>

    the Parliament commends the Ayrshire Central Maternity Unit as an excellent and cost
    effective facility which provides a much appreciated service to its local community, and
    calls upon Ayrshire and Arran Health Board to retain the unit rather than closing it in
    favour of alternative facilities at Crosshouse Hospital.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-700</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Service Tax</strong>&#151;That the
