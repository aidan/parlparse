<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#fend">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5189</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Maggie&rsquo;s Highland Cancer Caring Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow design firm Page and Park Architects for winning the prestigious Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland Andrew Doolan Award for Maggie&rsquo;s Highland Cancer Caring Centre in Inverness; notes that the building beat off competition from Perth Concert Hall, Glasgow&rsquo;s Saltire Centre and the new Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters, and endorses comments by Professor Simon Unwin of Dundee University, one of the award judges, that, with a complex tangle of intertwining curves and using a palette of warm and pliable materials, the interior meets uncertainty with companionship and reassurance, the design is sympathetic to the original beliefs of Maggie Keswick Jencks that good design can influence good health.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5188</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>A Century of Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the launch of &quot;Edinburgh&rsquo;s Volunteers: A Century of Change&quot;, an exhibition which celebrates the history of volunteers in Edinburgh and the Lothians and outlines the development of volunteering in this area over the centuries; urges all MSPs to visit the exhibition, which is located at the Museum of Edinburgh on the Royal Mile until 3 March 2007 and includes photographs, objects and oral histories about volunteers; recognises the collaboration of the Living Memory Association and the Volunteer Centre Edinburgh to provide tremendous assistance in the creation of this exhibition, and further notes the importance of volunteer contributions to enriching the lives of the people of Edinburgh and the Lothians over the last century.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5187</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Public Campaign of the Year 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly congratulates all those who took part in the Sakchai Makao campaign, named Campaign of the Year at the Herald Diageo Politician of the Year Awards 2006, and all those from around Scotland and the world who supported the campaign; hopes that the campaign&rsquo;s lasting legacy will be to prove that arrests and deportations should not be used to deflect political pressure, and urges the Scottish Executive in future to defend all Scots, whether born here or not, with the determination, compassion and humanity that Shetlanders have shown in defending Sakchai.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5186</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Commercial Whaling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the continuation of commercial whaling, whether overtly or under the guise of scientific research, by Iceland, Norway and Japan; condemns the economic folly of this activity, in the absence of a market for whalemeat, in addition to its moral indefensibility; further condemns the expansion of whaling from minke whales to include fin whale and other species and, while recognising the right of indigenous peoples to hunt whales on a subsistence basis, congratulates the UK Government for its firm stance against whaling, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations, both through the UK Government and directly where possible, to the whaling nations to cease whaling immediately.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5185</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the launch of the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society&rsquo;s &quot;Get it on time&quot; campaign to raise awareness of the importance of ensuring that people with Parkinson&rsquo;s in hospitals and care homes get their medication on time, every time; recognises that, when patients do not get their medication on time, every time, their Parkinson&rsquo;s symptoms become uncontrolled and they can become very ill; notes that there is currently no known cure for Parkinson&rsquo;s; supports the efforts of all those engaged in research into all aspects of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease at centres across the United Kingdom, and congratulates the society for investing more than &pound;30 million in research since it was founded in 1969.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5183</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to James Simpson and the Scottish Drugs Forum for the Success of the Addiction Workers Training Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates James Simpson for his achievement in being named as the nation&rsquo;s Champion Learner of the Year 2006 and further congratulates the Scottish Drugs Forum on the success of its ground-breaking addiction workers training project; recognises that this course was set up to help overcome the barriers to employment that former users face because of their drug history while preparing them for work in the field; notes that students learn about topics such as models of addiction, record-keeping, confidentiality issues and calming and supporting people and are able to take up placements at various different drug support agencies; acknowledges that measures to tackle drug problems will only be most effective when drug users are offered a route out of their problems through jobs, education and training, and applauds James Simpson for facing up to, and overcoming, his problems and the Scottish Drugs Forum for giving him a route out of his addiction.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5182</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Oppose &quot;Back-Door&quot; Privatisation of Ferry Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern about the effective privatisation of the Gourock to Dunoon ferry route through the decision of the publicly-owned ferry operator, Caledonian MacBrayne, not to tender for the route and believes that CalMac&rsquo;s decision confirms the warning of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union that the whole enforced tendering process amounted to &quot;back door&quot; privatisation of ferry services; believes that the CalMac decision leaves the Gourock to Dunoon route to be run as a monopoly by the existing private sector operator and demands assurances concerning the future jobs and conditions of those CalMac staff who currently work on the route, and further believes that ferry services and other public transport modes should be returned to public ownership and democratic control to allow maximum devotion to the safety and needs of users not to maximum profits and dividend payments for private shareholders.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5182.1</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Oppose &quot;Back-Door&quot; Privatisation of Ferry Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5182) in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave out from &quot;effective&quot; to end and insert &quot;future of the tendering process for the main bundle of Clyde and Hebridean routes following the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s inability to attract any bidders to run the Gourock to Dunoon route; notes, however, that it is grossly misleading to describe this as amounting to &quot;back door privatisation&quot;, given that the route will almost certainly now be re-tendered with subsidy from the Executive, allowing Ministers to micromanage and control the level of service more than at present; believes that this latest setback highlights once again the Executive&rsquo;s inability to conduct a fair and transparent tendering process following the previous debacle of firms withdrawing from the Northern Isles, Clyde and Hebrides and Gourock to Dunoon tenders, and, in an effort to restore confidence on the part of both the public and ferry operators in the entire maritime tendering process, calls on the Executive to remove any suggestion of bias on its part by renouncing the comments of Nicol Stephen MSP on &quot;Good Morning Scotland&quot; on 10 December 2004 when he stated &quot;We have to make sure that, if we are forced by Europe, we have the very best prospect possible of CalMac winning that tender&quot;.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5181</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Best Wishes to Hugo Chavez</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the huge strides made by the democratically elected government of the Bolivarian Socialist Republic of Venezuela in reducing poverty, illiteracy and inequality and in tackling homelessness and poor quality housing through its socialist programmes over the years since the election of Hugo Chavez in 1998; therefore sends its best wishes to Hugo Chavez as he seeks re-election to the presidency on 3 December 2006, and believes that the United States of America must stop interfering in Venezuela&rsquo;s democratic process and accept the will of the Venezuelan people to support and elect a socialist president and government.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5179</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Renationalise Vital Energy Utilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the latest obscene profits posted by Scottish Power, of &pound;483 million over the last six months, a 77% increase on the same period 12 months ago; further notes that these huge profits are generated on the back of unjustified price hikes like the 17% increase in gas prices and 10% increase in electricity prices introduced in June 2006, that such price increases cause real and dangerous hardship for low income and pensioner households in particular and that gas and electricity prices have been increased 11 times in 2006 alone by the privately owned energy companies with Centrica, formerly British Gas, posting profits of over &pound;1 billion last year, and believes that gas and electricity production should be returned to the public sector where they belong so that prices to citizens can be lowered and properly regulated, and that surplus revenue from the production and sales of energy should be ploughed into society&rsquo;s common wealth to allow real investment in public services instead of further enrichment of private individual shareholders and fat cat chief executives.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5175</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the National Osteoporosis Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the National Osteoporosis Society, which is the only UK national charity dedicated to eradicating the consequences of undiagnosed and untreated osteoporosis, on its work; calls on MSPs to help to encourage everyone they meet to keep good bone health by doing some weight-bearing exercise and remaining active; asks everyone to afford themselves the opportunity of bone-density screening where available, especially if they know that they could be at risk, and encourages everyone to adopt a healthy eating and drinking lifestyle by enjoying a wide variety of food to ensure a mix of necessary vitamins and minerals to influence the 20% of bone health that is not genetically inherited.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5167</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Reverse the Manufacturing Slump</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the dramatic collapse in manufacturing industry as far as share of gross domestic product (GDP) and percentage of jobs across the economy are concerned, as reflected in the most recent statistics which reveal that manufacturing&rsquo;s share of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s GDP has slumped from 21% in 1997 to only 13.6% in 2006, that the number of workers employed in the manufacturing sector in Scotland is now only 235,000, representing 10.3% of all jobs, and that manufacturing&rsquo;s share of GDP in Scotland has dropped from 21.8% in 1997 to less than 15% today; believes that manufacturing is a critical sector for economic development and success but that without more direct public control and democratic administration of wealth-creating manufacturing concerns, allied to significant investment in research, development and skills improvements, our ability to provide a decent, improved and sustained standard and quality of life for all our citizens will be diminished, and calls for public ownership of our financial sector to facilitate real investment in our manufacturing capacity.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5166</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Oppose Politically Driven Public Service Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the report from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) into the effect of the &pound;375 million cost-cutting exercise by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) which has decimated the service to the public so much that the PAC Chairman, Edward Leigh MP, described the service as &quot;unresponsive, overcomplicated and unreliable&quot; and that the &quot;people left hanging on the phone would have met with derisive laughter the claim by the DWP that it was modernising the delivery of welfare benefits&quot;; also notes that a total of 21 million calls to the DWP helplines went unanswered, representing almost half, 44%, of all calls to Jobcentre Plus, the Pension Service and the Disability and Carers Service (DCS) and that the worst problems were experienced by callers to DCS helplines, with inquiries about Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance getting through to a member of staff in only 21% of cases; condemns the New Labour government for implementing such politically motivated and damaging cuts in essential services for the most vulnerable citizens, and supports the campaign of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union and other welfare and pensioners&rsquo; groups to reverse these cuts.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5157</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Vexatious Exemptions Under Freedom of Information Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the increasing pattern of failure of public bodies in Scotland to respond timeously to requests for information under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 and increasingly to use vexatious and inappropriate exemptions in response to requests; further notes that appeals from individuals must be dealt with more swiftly, and therefore urges the Scottish government to lead by example so that all public bodies uphold the spirit of the Act and respond positively to its provisions in order that they are truly open, accountable for their actions and transparent.</p>
