<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5299</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to David Roy MBE</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, on Sunday 29 November 2009, Linlithgow Rose Football Club will host a celebration dinner to thank David Roy MBE and mark his 50 years of service as club secretary; considers that this remarkable period of service to the club in the post of club secretary has seen Linlithgow Rose FC develop into one of Scotland&rsquo;s leading junior football clubs, record on attendance of 3,626 at Prestonfield Park for a match against Petershill in the 1960s and secure a host of honours in the junior game, including winning East Super League in 2004 and 2007 and the Scottish Junior Cup three times, in 1965, 2002 and, most recently, in 2007; notes that David Roy was honoured by Her Majesty the Queen with the award of MBE for his services to junior football in Scotland; joins with the management committee, players and supporters of Linlithgow Rose FC, the people of Linlithgow and the junior football community across Scotland in commending David Roy for his dedication to Linlithgow Rose FC and to football in Scotland generally, and congratulates him on his half century of service to sport.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5298</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>10:10</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that it is vital that Scotland and the United Kingdom demonstrate political leadership in response to the climate crisis, particularly ahead of the United Nations climate change summit in Copenhagen (COP15); reaffirms its view that it is vital that COP15 should lead to an international agreement on action that will avert the worst effects of catastrophic climate change; emphasises that action taken now to tackle the climate crisis will cost less than action taken in the future; welcomes the goals of the 10:10 campaign, which calls for a 10% reduction in carbon emissions in 2010; notes that almost 50,000 people, 2,000 businesses, 1,000 schools and colleges and 1,000 other organisations across the UK have already pledged to do their part, and so calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Scottish Government and all other public sector bodies to make it their policy to reduce their carbon emissions by 10% in 2010.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5296</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Attendance Allowance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the uncertainty around the future of carer&rsquo;s allowance, caused by proposals contained in the UK Government&rsquo;s green paper about the future of adult care in England, <em>Shaping the future of care together</em>, seeking to introduce a change throughout the United Kingdom in order to integrate the proceeds of attendance allowance directly into social care and considers that one of the current qualifying conditions for carer&rsquo;s allowance is that the carer spend at least 35 hours a week looking after someone receiving attendance allowance and that therefore it is unclear how carers, caring for someone over the age of 65, would in future qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance, as a consequence of the proposals to integrate attendance allowance into social care budgets.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5289</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Community Hospitals in Dumfries and Galloway</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the contents of NHS Dumfries and Galloway&rsquo;s consultation document, <em>Your NHS - Your Future Care</em>; believes that the preferred option, which would result in the closure of Moffat, Langholm, Kirkcudbright, Lochmaben and Thornhill community hospitals, is widely unpopular with the respective local communities and fundamentally disregards the rural remoteness of parts of the region and the invaluable and high quality of care provided by these facilities; further believes that NHS Dumfries and Galloway must take advantage of opportunities to redevelop hospitals in conjunction with other statutory bodies, private providers and voluntary organisations where necessary, and considers that the Scottish Government should reject NHS Dumfries and Galloway&rsquo;s preferred option for closures and, instead, require redesign of the proposals to redevelop these vital, locally delivered community NHS services.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5287</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Relentless Education Cuts across Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports parents, teachers and pupils across Edinburgh in their opposition to further school budget cuts to be implemented by the City of Edinburgh Council; considers the strain that last year&rsquo;s 1.5% cut placed on school resources and staff; is strongly opposed to a further 2.5% cut year-on-year for the next three years; sees this as a complete failure by the SNP/Liberal Democrat administration to manage its budget and is dismayed that it is allowing children&rsquo;s education to suffer as a direct result of this; views that the cumulative effect of this will mean a cut of 9% in 2012-13; considers that head teachers are already struggling to meet basic school running costs such as heating and toilet repairs; is aware of the strength of feeling among communities and teachers, many of whom could lose their jobs in order to balance budgets; further considers that teacher unemployment is at an all-time high in Scotland while class sizes have reached 32 in some schools; believes that further cuts will only compound the problem and further adversely affect the standard and quality of children&rsquo;s education; believes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s lack of intervention and action on this issue shows that its priorities are totally wrong, particularly when it invests so much time and money in making a case for separation from the rest of the United Kingdom instead of investing in Scotland&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s education; thinks that this, combined with its failure to build or refurbish one single school since May 2007, shows a total lack of commitment to improving education, and demands that the SNP/Liberal Democrat administration and the Scottish Government come together and resolve the funding crisis that is believed to be destroying education across the city.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5287.1</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Relentless Education Cuts across Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5287) in the name of George Foulkes, leave out from &quot;in their opposition&quot; to end and insert &quot;in their desire to see the City of Edinburgh Council deliver the best education service possible under extremely difficult financial circumstances; considers that the 1.5% schools budget savings implemented by the City of Edinburgh Council in the 2007-08 financial year were necessary; further considers that the City of Edinburgh Council succeeded in protecting the schools budget in the 2008-09 financial year but acknowledges that further savings will have to be made in the future; considers these savings to be both necessary and the direct result of disastrous financial management by the previous City of Edinburgh Council administration that was voted out of office, leaving a &pound;14 million budget deficit in the children and families department, and of the recession caused by the current UK Government&rsquo;s dreadful handling of the economy that has lead to budget cuts across Scotland and severe job losses in Edinburgh; acknowledges that, despite the 2007-08 budget savings, Edinburgh&rsquo;s schools outperformed the Scottish average in terms of SQA exam pass rates in 2008-09; further notes that they are continuing to improve, having surpassed their results for 2007-08 and delivered the best advanced higher results in six years, and considers that, rather than continue to apportion blame, all parties must acknowledge the reality of the problems that the recession has caused and work together to deliver pragmatic solutions to the current funding crisis while continuing to support the success of Edinburgh&rsquo;s education system.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5109#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Detention of Children at Dungavel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern over figures obtained from the UK Border Agency that show that, between October 2008 and September 2009, 103 children were detained at Dungavel in Scotland; notes that, in the last five years, 889 children from 488 families throughout the United Kingdom have been held for over 28 days, thus requiring UK ministers to personally approve continued detention; considers that these figures show that, despite the welcome commitment and efforts of the previous administration and the current Scottish Government to end the practice of the detention of children at Dungavel, children and families from Glasgow and throughout Scotland are still being subjected to this unacceptable practice, and would welcome further efforts from all political parties in Scotland to ensure that this practice is ended.</p>
