    Parliament calls upon the Parliamentary Bureau to propose that a debate be scheduled as a
    matter of urgency on the proposed visit of convicted rapist Mike Tyson to Glasgow and all
    its surrounding circumstances, including the cost of policing throughout the visit and the
    number of officers to be diverted from other duties, and affirms its belief in the policy
    of zero tolerance. </p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-883</b> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Use of National Stadium for Mike Tyson
    Fight</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that the National Stadium, funded by public
    money, is to be used as the venue for the controversial Mike Tyson fight; further notes
    that as the Scottish Football Association has been gifted custodianship of Scotland&#146;s
    national stadium it has a responsibility to the Scottish public to act as a good
    gatekeeper; believes that it has failed badly in this task by allowing the National
    Stadium to be used as a venue for this event, and calls for the Association urgently to
    reconsider this decision taking into account the opinions of the people of Scotland as
    reflected by the Parliament.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-882#</b> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Edinburgh Folk Festival</strong>&#151;That

    musicians, former festival volunteers, members of the Adult Learning Project&#146;s Scots
    Music Group, members of Edinburgh Folk Club, the Wee Folk Club, Scottish Traditions of
    Dance Trust and others, concern was expressed about a perceived lack of political support
    for the traditional arts, and asks the Executive to recognise and encourage the important
    role of the traditional arts in its forthcoming National Cultural Strategy.</p>

    Scotland in campaigning for a fair deal for carers.</p>

    the Parliament strongly urges the Scottish Football Association to side with Scotland and

    Scotland&#146;s national stadium. </p>

    S1M-854 which together carry the support of more than half of the Parliament; further
    notes the Home Secretary&#146;s decision to allow Mike Tyson into the United Kingdom in
    order that he should fight for financial gain; notes that this decision has been taken
    despite the fact that Mike Tyson has been convicted and sentenced for rape, a situation
    which would normally prohibit entry to this country, and therefore believes that a
    judicial review of this decision should be undertaken.</p>

    <b><p ALIGN="left">S1M-874#</b> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Young People and Transport</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament welcomes the recent publication by the Save the Children Fund (SCF) of the
    report <i>Going My Way: What Children and Young People Say About Transport</i>; believes
    that the report highlights the problems which many young people face in accessing
    transport in rural areas such as Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, and asks the Scottish
    Executive to give consideration to adopting the recommendations of the report which
    include the creation of a national subsidised youth fare scheme for 16 and 17 year olds,
    the creation of further opportunities for the development of Home Zones and support for
    local authorities to designate 10mph speed limits in appropriate areas.</p>

    Criminal Records Office</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the prosecution of Shirley
    McKie for perjury arising out of a Strathclyde Police investigation, the complete
    vindication of Shirley McKie following trial, and the body of evidence collated by BBC <i>Frontline
    Scotland</i> which proves, with the involvement of leading international fingerprint
    experts, that the fingerprint evidence led at her case was false; regrets that there has
    yet to be any attempt to apologise to, or secure financial restitution for, Shirley McKie
    despite her great personal suffering and the loss of her career in Strathclyde Police;
    expresses concern that the fingerprint officers from the Scottish Criminal Record Office
    (SCRO) involved in her case have not been suspended and that no full and independent
    investigation has been ordered by the Scottish Executive into the actions of either
    Strathclyde Police or SCRO, and considers that the Scottish Executive should accept the
    implications of the McKie case which must include such investigations as well as a
    complete re-examination of criminal prosecutions involving fingerprint identification from
    SCRO and those officers.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">S1M-870</b> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Expedition to the North Pole</strong>&#151;That

    Caring City International Relief Aid&quot; on raising the remarkable sum of £2 million

    Parliament notes with grave concern the implications of the proposed construction of the
    Ilisu Dam in Southeast Turkey, in particular, possible environmental damage to the area,
    the flooding of the ancient town of Hasankeyf and the forcible eviction of 25,000, mainly
    Kurdish, residents from their villages; questions the basis for the decision of the Export
    Credits Guarantee Department to underwrite the project with £200 million of tax
    payers&#146; money, and calls upon Her Majesty&#146;s Government to review, as a matter of

    transport on the service receives no public subsidy at present; further notes that nothing
    in the current proposals precludes CalMac from continuing to carry vehicles; and
    recognises that, to have the best chance of securing the long-term future of the service,
    all interested parties should support the Minister in her negotiations with the Commission
    to the fullest of their ability.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">S1M-856#</b> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh: Assisted Area Status of Arbroath</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with concern the exclusion of Arbroath from the revised Assisted Area
    boundary proposals; recognises that while significant gains have been made in recent years
    to restructure the local economy, the case for re-inclusion is strong, given the
    consistently high levels of unemployment, the significant dependence on a declining
    manufacturing sector, and the opportunities which exist to benefit from Regional Selective
    Assistance; understands that without Assisted Area status recent gains in Arbroath will be
    reversed, and invites the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Department of
    Trade and Industry to reinstate the excluded areas.</p>

    used as a showcase to make money for a convicted rapist; notes that Mike Tyson is
    presently the subject of police inquiries in Las Vegas over an alleged incident of a woman
    being assaulted and verbally abused, and shares the views of women&#146;s groups in
    Scotland and throughout Britain, which were appalled at the previous decision by the Home
    Secretary to allow Mike Tyson to enter Britain, the resultant strain on police and the
    lack of contrition shown to women&#146;s groups by Mike Tyson.</p>

    current mechanisms and initiatives to alleviate these problems are hampered by the lack of
    any system to accurately measure rural disadvantage to allow effective targeting of
    resources, which has resulted in pockets of extreme deprivation in rural areas being
    ignored, and believes that a long overdue Scottish Rural Deprivation Index, a means of
    collecting local rather than region-wide data and a system which ensures fair and
    equitable allocations of funding should be established and that, in the spirit of
