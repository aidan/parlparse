<STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: Quality of Life</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament supports 
the work of the Scottish Executive, the all-party group on quality of life, local 
authorities and other stakeholders to improve the quality of life in Scotland&#146;s 
communities, notably the allocation to local authorities of £95 million this year 
and a further £180 million for the next three years to improve the local environment 
and the quality of people&#146;s daily lives.</P><P>Supported by: Peter Peacock<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3542</STRONG> <STRONG>Robin Harper: British Energy Finances</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the decision at the extraordinary general meeting of British 
Energy in East Kilbride on 4 November 2002 to approve the borrowing of up to £1.6 
billion; further notes that the £650 million loan from Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
to the company has been declared unlawful by the EU Competition Commissioner Mario 
Monti; is aware that British Energy has requested that local authorities defer 
payment of business rates for its nuclear power stations; is further aware that 
Lancaster City Council has deferred the business rates of Heysham Nuclear Power 
Station at an estimated cost to the taxpayer of £18,000 and a possible cost of 
up to £1.7 million if British Energy is eventually called into receivership, and 
calls on the Scottish Executive to state whether any local authority has deferred 
payment of business rates of any British Energy installations and, if so, at what 
actual and possible cost to taxpayers.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3541</STRONG> <STRONG>Allan 
Wilson: Forestry in Scotland</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the report 
of the Interdepartmental Review Group on Forestry; welcomes the proposed changes 
to the administrative arrangements for forestry in Scotland contained in that 
report; notes the proposals by an industry-wide steering group for a new Scottish 
Forestry Grants Scheme, and believes these changes will help achieve the objectives 
set out in the Scottish Forestry Strategy.</P><P>Supported by: Ross Finnie<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3540#</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Exploitation of Women</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with concern the increasing proliferation of lap-dancing 
clubs and other establishments of a similar nature throughout Scotland; further 
notes that the US-based firm Spearmint Rhino, reported to be linked with pornographic 
websites featuring the drugging, abduction and rape of women, has plans to expand 
its lap-dancing operations into Scotland; believes that these establishments encourage 
the exploitation of women and have no place in a modern Scotland seeking to promote 
equality and eradicate violence against women, and therefore considers that the 
Scottish Executive should monitor this situation closely and take whatever action 
is necessary to halt the spread of these establishments.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3539</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Alex Neil: Immediate Establishment of Public Appointments Committee</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament calls upon the Parliamentary Bureau to consider and propose the 
establishment of a Parliamentary Public Appointments Committee initially to oversee 
the current Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointment as its work relates 
to Scottish Executive appointments pending the establishment of a Scottish Commissioner 
for Public Appointments, after which the remit of the committee shall be to carry 
out interviews and recommend an individual for the post of Scottish Commissioner 
for Public Appointments once the Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) 
Bill has been passed; scrutinise the work of the Scottish Commissioner and, specifically, 
the Commissioner&#146;s annual report; take appropriate action when the Commissioner 
reports a breach in the Code of Conduct for making public appointments; ask the 
commissioner for guidance on particular appointments; and interview all major 
appointees to non-departmental public bodies on their appointment to discuss the 
policy and priorities of that body.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3538#</STRONG> <STRONG>John 
Farquhar Munro: Affordable Rural Housing</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
the shortfall in affordable housing in rural areas for rent or for purchase particularly 
for young families; acknowledges that, in part, the cause of this can be traced 
to second home ownership; believes that in order to maintain a sustainable future 
for rural Scotland measures must be taken to encourage young people and families 
to remain in their communities, and considers that the Parliament should review 
the provision of socially rented housing as well as the extent of second home 
ownership throughout rural Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3537</STRONG> <STRONG>Donald 
Gorrie: Tourism Information for People with Disabilities</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament urges VisitScotland to respond to the report by Capability Scotland 
<em>An Open or Shut Case? - How Scotland meets the needs of disabled tourists</em> 
by taking action to remedy the defect which the report identifies in the system 
for informing people with disabilities about the many facilities which are suitable 
for them.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3536.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Michael Russell: Flexibility 
and Innovation in Schools</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3536) in 
the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end &quot;but regrets that the Executive 
seems unable to take on board ideas which will make a real difference in the medium 
and long term such as the need for a substantial lowering in class sizes, particularly 
in the early years of primary, the simplification of the Scottish exam system, 
the review of 5-14 with the aim of creating more flexibility and less pressure, 
the building and development of a collective and collegiate view of school management 
as envisaged in the McCrone agreement (which should also involve parents and young 
people), and other major topics, but instead seeks to apply spin and hype to a 
First Minister&#146;s vision of education that is lacking in vision and depth 
and does not constructively address the main issue of providing the best education 
possible for every child in Scotland.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3536.2</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Flexibility and Innovation in Schools</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3536) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end 
&quot;and, towards concretely achieving this aim, agrees to deliver a maximum 
primary class size of 20 within 12 months through intensive training, innovative 
recruitment and necessary investment taking inspiration from the Republic of Cuba 
which has delivered such a target in a similar timescale with much scarcer resources, 
and further agrees to implement a similar maximum class size of 20 in the secondary 
school sector within 24 months as a central plank of a fundamentally improved 
package of state school funding and investment.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3536.3</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Flexibility and Innovation in Schools</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3536) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end 
&quot;and believes that greater flexibility should include giving new opportunities 
for children to study a wider range of courses, including those at further education 
colleges, from the age of 14.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3532 Friction Dynamex</STRONG>
