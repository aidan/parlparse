          <p><strong>*S3M-618</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>A Fair Deal for our Primary Producers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the continuing plight of our primary producers in achieving a fair price at the farm gate; further notes the imbalance of power in the supply chain between primary producers and large processors and retailers, and considers that the Scottish Government, in line with its 2007 manifesto pledge, must do everything to ensure that those higher up the supply chain do not exploit primary producers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-617</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Early Payments for Less Favoured Areas Support Scheme and the Beef Calf Support Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the significant benefit to those in the agriculture sector in having access to the Less Favoured Areas Support Scheme (LFASS) and Beef Calf Support Scheme (BCSS); further recognises the recent difficulties experienced by the sector, and considers that the Scottish Government, in supporting a viable and sustainable agriculture industry, should bring forward LFASS and BCSS payments to relieve the unprecedented pressure on the sector created by the damaging effects of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and the recent dramatic hike in feed prices.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-616</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Combating Sectarianism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the launch of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education&rsquo;s <em>Count</em> <em>Us In - Promoting Understanding and Combating Sectarianism </em>good practice guide which outlines positive examples of promoting religious tolerance and challenging sectarian attitudes in Scotland&rsquo;s schools and communities; embraces the fact that Scotland is a multicultural, diverse society; acknowledges the significant strides made in recent years in tackling sectarianism; recognises the vital work being done with young people through educational initiatives such as the twinning of denominational and non-denominational schools and the efforts of organisations such as Nil by Mouth, and hopes that all sections of Scottish society and government will continue to support the campaign to free Scotland from sectarianism.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-615</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Still Human, Still Here</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Amnesty International on the launch of its campaign, Still Human, Still Here, which seeks to highlight the plight of asylum seekers who, having reached the end of the asylum process, have no support and are living in destitution; is concerned that many such asylum seekers are unable to return home for various reasons; believes that cutting off support can be counter-productive as it can drive people underground and into the illegal labour market, and therefore believes that a better way must be found to allow asylum seekers in this situation the ability to access healthcare, housing and financial support until such time as they can return home safely or are granted leave to remain in Britain.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-614</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Scottish Special Olympics Athletes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes every success to the Scottish participants at the 12th Special Olympics World Summer Games being held in Shanghai from 2 to 11 October 2007; notes that the games are described as the largest sporting event of the year with almost 7,500 Special Olympics athletes participating from 196 nations; commends the work of the Special Olympics in providing an opportunity for its athletes to demonstrate their abilities and talents on a world stage, and congratulates the Scottish contingent of 93 athletes and coaches for their success in being selected to compete in this great sporting occasion.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-613</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Lerwick - 2007 Fishing Port of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Lerwick Port Authority has won the 2007 Fishing Port of the Year award in the face of competition from the other finalists, Newlyn Pier and Harbour Commissioners, Peterhead Port Authority and Plymouth Sutton Harbour Fisheries; further notes that Lerwick&rsquo;s success is well-deserved, given the excellent facilities it provides for both the white fish and the pelagic fishing fleets, in recent years leading the way in the introduction of a modern temperature-controlled fish market, an electronic fish auction and deep water berths to match the growing needs of the fishing fleet;  believes that the success is the result of the hard work and vision, over many years, of the port authority&rsquo;s staff and board members and of the many Lerwick businesses that support the fishing industry, and congratulates them on their well-deserved success.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-612#</strong> <strong>Paul Martin:</strong> <strong>Car Parking Charges at Stobhill Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to introduce car parking charges at Stobhill Hospital later this year; recognises the impact that this proposal will have on the local community through inconsiderate parking by car commuters in residential areas surrounding the hospital; is concerned that current provision of public transport to and from Stobhill Hospital is insufficient, and considers that a new car parking policy that would remove car parking charges at Stobhill Hospital should be developed.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-610</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Quality Meat Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusion of the Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) Research and Development Strategy 2004-2007; notes that it has funded 52 practical projects to ensure a sustainable and profitable future for Scotland&rsquo;s farmers and has been a touchstone for generating more than &pound;1.5 million additional funding for research in the agricultural sector; congratulates the more than 500 Scottish farmers who have so far taken part in the successful Monitor Farm project, and notes the upcoming launch of the QMS Research and Development Strategy for 2007-2010.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-607.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>The Scottish National Party&rsquo;s Broken Promises</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-607) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;further notes the SNP Government&rsquo;s reluctance to keep its promise to students and dump student debt by writing off the debt to the Student Loans Company for Scottish domiciled graduates; notes the SNP Government&rsquo;s refusal to meet its manifesto pledge for mandatory carbon reduction targets of 3% per annum; recognises that the SNP gained votes on these pre-election promises to the people of Scotland which they are now failing to keep, and calls on Scottish ministers to make a statement to the Parliament explaining which of these pre-election promises are no longer government policy and why, and which promises they do intend to implement and by when.&quot;</p>
