<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2239</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Scottish Education Awards 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates East Dunbartonshire schools for their four awards in the Scottish Education Awards 2008; notes that awards were given to St Ninian&rsquo;s High School, Kirkintilloch (International Schools National Award and Teacher of the Year National Award), Milngavie Primary School (Most Enterprising Primary School National Award), and Merkland School, Kirkintilloch (Most Enterprising Special School National Award); recognises the fantastic achievement in winning such awards and that East Dunbartonshire won the most awards of any local authority in Scotland at the ceremony on Friday 13 June 2008, and acknowledges that East Dunbartonshire schools were shortlisted for seven national awards.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2238</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Woodburn Day Nursery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposal by the Labour/Tory/Independent Falkirk Council to close the Woodburn Day Nursery in Falkirk; notes that the nursery is a well-established community facility whose staff play an active part in the wider community; recognises that to close the facility would be contrary to the council&rsquo;s stated policies of community participation  and that Woodburn Nursery should remain in the community which it serves, and calls on the council to abandon its centralisation agenda.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2237</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Register Protest against Lloyds TSB</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the actions of Lloyds TSB which has written to its customers who have business dealings with Cuba informing them to cut all ties with Cuba or move their accounts; believes that such actions will undoubtedly cause more hardship and unnecessary suffering for the ordinary people of Cuba; encourages Lloyds TSB&rsquo;s account holders and business clients to consider withdrawing their custom in protest, and urges others to register their protest in order to reverse this decision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2236</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Stonehouse Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the children and staff of Stonehouse Primary School, together with the wider community of Stonehouse, for the links that they have developed with Mulanje Mission, Malawi; in particular applauds their efforts to raise over &pound;2,000 to help with educational facilities in that area; notes the provision of teacher housing and a small chicken farm, also funded through their fundraising, and wishes them every success in their efforts to provide further support next year.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2235</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>HBOS/Barnardo&rsquo;s Tug of War Competition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all competitors who took part in the fourth Holyrood tug of war competition on Wednesday 18 June 2008, organised by HBOS plc and Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland, which raised &pound;5,000 for the charity; congratulates <em>The Scotsman</em> newspaper team on its victory and ending the Scottish Conservatives reign as champions; recognises the participation of all the other competing teams and welcomes Holyrood Communications post-match support for competitors, and thanks HBOS plc, Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland and the Scottish Tug of War Association for providing an entertaining and worthwhile event where charity is the real winner.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2234</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Banff Academy - Young Engineers Club of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Banff Academy on its award of Young Engineers Club of the Year at the Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI)&rsquo;s Celebration of Engineering; notes the club members&rsquo; hard work throughout the year and club co-ordinator David Pirie&rsquo;s dedication and enthusiasm, and acknowledges the contribution of teachers and Scottish companies that have contributed to the success of SCDI&rsquo;s network of 260 young engineers clubs that saw a record 600 young engineers, teachers and companies attending this year&rsquo;s celebration.</p>

As a tax paying citizen of Scotland, the United Kingdom and Europe I should not be discriminated against or offered a lower rate of exchange or charged commission or refused sale for using Scottish money in England, Europe or any foreign country or have to convert it into English notes first. I no longer find it acceptable that my elected members cannot find parliamentary time to sort out the mess of the UK currency, or deal with the discrimination that people using Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes often face. Either sort it or give us all the same currency as I fear the resentment and embarrassment felt when Scots and Northern Irish face refusal or are discriminated against with lower rates of exchange will not help with European or British unity&quot;, and urges all those opposed to this discrimination to register their support by signing up to the petition.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2134.1</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Unacceptable Levels of Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2134) in the name of Jamie Hepburn, leave out from &quot;the Office&quot; to end and insert &quot;and encouragement the findings of the National Statistics publication <em>Scottish Households Below Average Income 2006-07 </em>which shows a marked decline since 1999-2000 in the number of households in both absolute and relative poverty, including a 28% decrease in relative child poverty and a 61% decrease in absolute child poverty meaning that the previous administration&rsquo;s target to halve absolute child poverty by 2010 has been met significantly ahead of schedule; believes that, while government at all levels should continue to strive to eliminate poverty completely, this progress would not have been possible without many of the initiatives by the previous administration and the UK Government, including the Sure Start programme, record increases in child benefit, the winter fuel allowance, the working families tax credit and the national minimum wage, the latter of which was finally passed in the House of Commons without the support of a single SNP MP, and is concerned that the SNP government&rsquo;s budget, passed with the Conservatives in this Session of the Parliament, and its single outcome agreements with local authorities are precipitating cuts to a range of local services including homecare services for the elderly, school classes and school meals provision as well as a host of voluntary organisations providing services for some of Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable citizens, that this threatens to undo much of the progress on poverty which the report outlines and that this seriously undermines the SNP&rsquo;s case to be trusted with more powers.&quot;</p>
