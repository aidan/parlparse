                                          Mary Scanlon: Investment in Bog Myrtle</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets that the Scottish Government cannot provide any funding under the Scotland Rural Development Programme&rsquo;s Rural Priorities scheme toward the growing of the bog myrtle plant; welcomes the commitment of Essentially Scottish Botanicals Ltd, based in Kiltarlity, Inverness-shire, to developing the bog myrtle plant as a commercial crop; considers that the bog myrtle industry has huge economic potential for Scotland; understands that the plant&rsquo;s properties are similar to that of Australian tea tree oil, which is reportedly worth over US$25 million in export sales to Australia each year; further understands that the bog myrtle plant holds even greater antiseptic, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties than tea tree oil; considers that bog myrtle has a huge advantage over tea tree oil in that it is hypoallergenic at relatively high concentrations; understands that the Australian Government part-funded research into the tea tree industry in order that oil yields could be increased from 148kg per hectare to 250kg per hectare; believes that, after initial planting investment, a low-maintenance bog myrtle plantation can have an average life of 20 years, and would welcome consideration of the ways in which research into increasing the yields of bog myrtle could be funded in order to make it a commercially attractive non-food crop.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5879 Cathy Peattie: Big Fit Walk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">congratulates the Big Fit Walk project on winning the Active Nation Award at the Active Factor 2010 Awards, the first ever awards ceremony held by the Physical Activity and Health Alliance; notes that the firstBig Fit Walk was held in June 2004 in Grangemouth and involved over 3,000 people andthat the walks haveattracted more walkers each year; wishes this year&rsquo;sBig Fit Walk, the seventh, great success,and looks forward to MSPshaving the opportunity to participate inthe Big Fit Walk in June 2010.</span></p>
