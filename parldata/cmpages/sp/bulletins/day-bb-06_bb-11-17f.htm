<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5182</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Oppose &quot;Back-Door&quot; Privatisation of Ferry Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern about the effective privatisation of the Gourock to Dunoon ferry route through the decision of the publicly-owned ferry operator, Caledonian MacBrayne, not to tender for the route and believes that CalMac&rsquo;s decision confirms the warning of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union that the whole enforced tendering process amounted to &quot;back door&quot; privatisation of ferry services; believes that the CalMac decision leaves the Gourock to Dunoon route to be run as a monopoly by the existing private sector operator and demands assurances concerning the future jobs and conditions of those CalMac staff who currently work on the route, and further believes that ferry services and other public transport modes should be returned to public ownership and democratic control to allow maximum devotion to the safety and needs of users not to maximum profits and dividend payments for private shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5181</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Best Wishes to Hugo Chavez</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the huge strides made by the democratically elected government of the Bolivarian Socialist Republic of Venezuela in reducing poverty, illiteracy and inequality and in tackling homelessness and poor quality housing through its socialist programmes over the years since the election of Hugo Chavez in 1998; therefore sends its best wishes to Hugo Chavez as he seeks re-election to the presidency on 3 December 2006, and believes that the United States of America must stop interfering in Venezuela&rsquo;s democratic process and accept the will of the Venezuelan people to support and elect a socialist president and government.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5180</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises cyclical vomiting syndrome as a serious medical condition affecting up to 2% of school-age children; sympathises with all those who suffer from this serious debilitating illness which is very difficult to diagnose; commends the Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome Association UK for raising awareness of the illness, and calls on NHS boards to offer more support to sufferers and their families.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5179</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Renationalise Vital Energy Utilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the latest obscene profits posted by Scottish Power, of &pound;483 million over the last six months, a 77% increase on the same period 12 months ago; further notes that these huge profits are generated on the back of unjustified price hikes like the 17% increase in gas prices and 10% increase in electricity prices introduced in June 2006, that such price increases cause real and dangerous hardship for low income and pensioner households in particular and that gas and electricity prices have been increased 11 times in 2006 alone by the privately owned energy companies with Centrica, formerly British Gas, posting profits of over &pound;1 billion last year, and believes that gas and electricity production should be returned to the public sector where they belong so that prices to citizens can be lowered and properly regulated, and that surplus revenue from the production and sales of energy should be ploughed into society&rsquo;s common wealth to allow real investment in public services instead of further enrichment of private individual shareholders and fat cat chief executives.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5178</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations on the Organising for Fighting Unions Conference</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the trade union movement on its recent Organising for Fighting Unions conference; notes that this was the biggest unofficial gathering of rank and file union activists for over 20 years; notes that for more than a generation workers have faced an onslaught on their jobs, wages, conditions and trade union rights as privatisation and deregulation have been implemented by both Conservative and New Labour governments; recognises that the early 21st century has seen a rebirth of radicalism on a global scale; agrees that now is the time for trade unionists to rebuild their organisations and recommit themselves to defend working peoples&rsquo; livelihoods and rights; notes that the Workers Charter includes the right to a job that pays a living wage and gives workers the right to time with their families and communities, the automatic right to union recognition and full employment rights from the first day of work, the right to equal pay and conditions for women and ethnic minority, young, migrant and casual workers, the right to a living minimum wage, the right to free public healthcare, welfare and education and to a liveable pension, the right to decent public housing or to private housing without crippling rents or mortgages, the right to public control of all vital public services and utilities, the right of workers to protect their own health and safety and their environment from corporate greed, the right of workers to express their personal identity free from discrimination, the right of workers to strike in defence of their interests and to campaign for the repeal of the Tory anti-union laws, including support for the defiance of those laws, the right to be able to take secondary, solidarity strike action without the threat of legal action, the right to organise for the transfer of wealth and power from the haves to the have-nots, partly through severe taxation of multinational corporations or their dismantling, and the right to unite with workers worldwide against corporate globalisation and war, and calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise and support this initiative and to ensure that it puts pressure on the UK Government to fully implement the charter.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5177</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Loss of 120 Jobs at Young&rsquo;s Seafood, Annan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave concern over the loss of 120 jobs at Young&rsquo;s Seafood in Annan, caused by the company&rsquo;s decision to cease machine peeling of langoustines at its Annan plant; recognises that this will be a grave blow to the individuals concerned, their families and the local economy; urges the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise to commit to offering whatever assistance they can to support the workers concerned; expresses profound concern that food processing companies such as Young&rsquo;s Seafood are shipping Scottish caught nephrops 12,000 miles for six weeks there and back to take advantage of low wages in the Far East, and considers that government should do all it can to encourage companies to take social and environmental considerations into account as well as commercial pressures.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5176</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Transport and Works (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Transport and Works (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure or increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in Rule 9.12.3(b)(iii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5175</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the National Osteoporosis Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the National Osteoporosis Society, which is the only UK national charity dedicated to eradicating the consequences of undiagnosed and untreated osteoporosis, on its work; calls on MSPs to help to encourage everyone they meet to keep good bone health by doing some weight-bearing exercise and remaining active; asks everyone to afford themselves the opportunity of bone-density screening where available, especially if they know that they could be at risk, and encourages everyone to adopt a healthy eating and drinking lifestyle by enjoying a wide variety of food to ensure a mix of necessary vitamins and minerals to influence the 20% of bone health that is not genetically inherited.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5174</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Airdrie-Bathgate Railway and Linked Improvements Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Airdrie-Bathgate Railway and Linked Improvements Bill, agrees to any expenditure of a kind referred to in Rule 9A.14.3(b)(ii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5173</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Social Work Funding Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern Aberdeen&rsquo;s social work funding crisis and is appalled that very significant service reductions of &pound;14 million are required for 2007-08 and beyond across all social work service provision in the city; further notes that this diminution of service will have a major impact on the lives of Aberdeen&rsquo;s most vulnerable citizens, and calls on the Scottish Executive to accept Aberdeen City Council&rsquo;s offer of talks and to take steps to close the gap between grant aided expenditure and the actual cost of providing children and young peoples&rsquo; services in Aberdeen which, according to a report prepared for Aberdeen City Council by Professor Arthur Midwinter, now stands at around &pound;10 million.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5172</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Ending Child Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that it is unacceptable that children living in severe poverty in Scotland are missing out on basic necessities such as fresh, nutritious food, new clothes and shoes and having a warm home in the winter; welcomes Save the Children&rsquo;s campaign to end child poverty, which highlights the effects for children and their families of living in severe and persistent poverty; acknowledges the progress made by the Scottish Executive in lifting 100,000 children in Scotland out of poverty and helping children in the Dumbarton constituency and across Scotland to improve their life chances, and believes that more needs to be done and that the Executive should prioritise the needs of the very poorest children and continue to work with the UK Government in implementing solutions, such as child seasonal grants, proposed as part of the Save the Children campaign.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5171</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Biometric Scanning of Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of Renfrewshire Council to install a biometric scanner system in Todholm Primary School in Paisley; believes that this is an unnecessary intrusion into the private lives of children and their families; condemns the Scottish Executive for allowing this system to be installed without a debate in the Parliament to discuss the implications of such a measure and its apparent inability to answer parliamentary questions on the matter, including questions on what company is supplying the system, the cost of the system, who is paying for the system, who stores the personal data collected, what safeguards are in place with regard to the storage of the data and whether parents had an opt-out of the system; believes that the introduction of such a system may be in breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and calls on the Executive to initiate a full debate in the Parliament as a matter of urgency on the issue.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5170</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of Scampi Job Losses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by Young&rsquo;s Seafood to send Scottish seafood 12,000 miles to Thailand to be processed; notes with concern that this move is a disaster for the environment as every tonne of scampi shipped to Thailand will generate half a tonne of carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change; further notes that this decision will result in the loss of 120 jobs in Young&rsquo;s processing plant in Annan and that this is due to the company&rsquo;s belief that the local workforce earn prohibitive wages despite local wages being no higher than the national average, and calls on the Scottish Executive to seek to ensure that Young&rsquo;s uses the statutory 90-day consultation period to try and find suitable alternative employment for its workers in the local area and to do everything in its power to minimise compulsory redundancies.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5169</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Christmas Day and New Year&rsquo;s Day Trading (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Christmas Day and New Year&rsquo;s Day Trading (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5168</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie on behalf of the Airdrie-Bathgate Railway and Linked Improvements Bill Committee:</strong> <strong>Airdrie-Bathgate Railway and Linked Improvements Bill - Preliminary Stage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Airdrie-Bathgate Railway and Linked Improvements Bill and that the Bill should proceed as a Private Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Morgan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5160.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Shipping of Prawns</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5160) in the name of Chris Ballance, insert at end &quot;further recognises that the decision of Young&rsquo;s Seafood Limited to implement this environmentally destructive plan is driven by the economic madness of unfettered globalisation and the pursuit of maximum profits at any costs, including the loss of 120 jobs in a community of only 8,000, that such rampant globalisation on the basis of the obscenely unfair rigged free market profit system of capitalism makes environmental action inconsistent with the continuation of that system and that being green in the world today requires policies that are socialist led.&quot;</p>
