            greetings to the Government and people of South Africa around this 
            historic day; further recognises that the final victory against the

            of various kinds resolved to uproot the evil system of apartheid and

            there are youths out on the street causing violence, causing disorder, 
            causing vandalism and graffiti and terrifying not just older people 
            but other young people; acknowledges that the problems of youth disorder 
            must be given a high priority if the right to peace and security at 
            home and in the community is to be protected; further notes that diverting 
            16- and 17-year-olds to the Children&#146;s Hearings System will only 
            defer effective deterrents and place an extra burden on a process 
            which is already overstretched and not respected by the young offenders, 
            and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to introduce an increased 
            range of disposals, including weekend and evening detention, expansion 
            of supervised attendance orders and community service and grounding, 
            coupled with an increase in secure accommodation and a substantial 
            increase in the number of community police officers to help make our 
            streets safer.</p>
