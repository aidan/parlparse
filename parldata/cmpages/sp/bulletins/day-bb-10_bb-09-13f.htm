<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6969 Irene Oldfather: Scottish Human Rights Commission, Care about Rights?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s awareness-raising project, Care About Rights?, which relates to the care and support of older people; notes that the project aims to empower people to understand their rights and increase the ability and accountability of those who have duties to respect, protect and fulfil human rights and is aimed at everyone who comes into contact with, and has responsibility for, care services for older people; believes that an increased awareness and knowledge of human rights issues and practical advice about how to apply human rights principles in the delivery of care will ensure that older people are given the respect that they deserve, and therefore supports the aim of the commission to see a commitment to human rights becoming central in everyday practice and policy in the care and support of older people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6968 Bill Kidd: Coalition Pile the Pressure on the Poor</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, is planning to cut a further &pound;4 billion from welfare spending in addition to the &pound;11 billion already announced by the UK Government and is of the view that positive measures to help the long-term unemployed are preferable to that of loading further punitive measures on to the most vulnerable in society.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6967# Jamie McGrigor: Oban Bay Marine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of recreational boating and marine tourism, which benefits the Scottish economy by upwards of &pound;300 million per annum; considers that Argyll and Bute is in the forefront of this sector with many successful marinas; is disappointed by the recent decision made by the board of Argyll and Bute Council&rsquo;s CHORD programme not to back the Oban Bay berthing scheme that was put forward by the Oban Bay Marine (OBM) company; congratulates the volunteers and backers of OBM for their hard work and financial support in relation to the scheme; would welcome the publication of the report that was the basis for the rejection of the proposal; notes that the OBM proposal was backed by many of the businesses and people in the area who have, for many years, believed that Oban needed a marina that could bring financial benefit to the local economy and take advantage of what is considered to be the steady expansion of Scottish sailing tourism by providing the right facilities in the area; further believes that Oban is a key west coast location for marine tourism and that the OBM proposal would complement existing local marinas; hopes that the &pound;900,000 earmarked for the project will still be used for the benefit of the Oban economy, and believes that a new transit marina would benefit the town of Oban and Scottish marine tourism as a whole.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong>, Elizabeth Smith<strong>*</strong>, Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-6966 Stuart McMillan: Save Our Ships</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the reports that the UK Government may be considering scrapping its aircraft carrier orders, which it considers would adversely affect the lives of up to 10,000 families, including apprentices; further notes that the UK Government is conducting a Strategic Defence and Security Review that does not include Trident; welcomes the support of UNISON and the Public and Commercial Services Union that are calling for Trident to be scrapped; calls on the UK Government to reappraise its position and to bring Trident into the review and maintain the orders for the two aircraft carriers to safeguard thousands of jobs and help local communities, and considers that Scotland has a proud tradition of shipbuilding, particularly on the Clyde and that the term Clydebuilt is still world renowned.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6966.1 Murdo Fraser: Save Our Ships</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6966) in the name of Stuart McMillan, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes what it considers the sudden interest from members of the Scottish National Party in the future of the Royal Navy; believes that an independent Scotland would require a navy presence of, at best, a handful of fishery protection vessels; further believes that it is inconceivable that, in the unlikely event of Scotland becoming independent from the rest of the United Kingdom, the residual UK Government would place naval shipbuilding orders with a foreign country, and condemns what it considers to be the hypocrisy of SNP politicians calling for the UK Government to maintain orders for two aircraft carriers when, in the Parliament&rsquo;s view, their flagship policy of independence would be devastating for the Scottish defence industry and mean the death knell of Scottish shipbuilding on the Clyde and at Rosyth.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6965 Robin Harper: Creative Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the full board of Creative Scotland has yet to meet and believes that this has led to a remarkable degree of uncertainty about that organisation&rsquo;s function; further believes that this uncertainty has not been allayed by the reported statement made by Creative Scotland&rsquo;s chief executive, Andrew Dixon, that the organisation is not a funding body in the sense of the former Scottish Arts Council; is concerned that Creative Scotland spent &pound;35,000 on a logo without being certain of what the badging represented; further notes the opinion of Kenneth Roy that the arts, considered a central part of Scotland&rsquo;s national life, are being surrendered to inexcusable chaos, and urges the Scottish Government to meet representatives of Creative Scotland as soon as possible and demand sight of its strategic plan and mission statement within a reasonable timescale and for Creative Scotland to undertake minimum expenditure on offices, staff and equipment until such time as its function can be fully defined.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6964 Irene Oldfather: 2010 Business Rates Revaluation,  Ayrshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the concerns of the Ayrshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry regarding the latest revaluation of business rates; notes that these rates were set based on information as at 1 April 2008 and did not take into account the current economic climate; further notes the decision by the Scottish Executive to remove the relief, which could have supported businesses now facing rate increases of up to 200%; further notes that a transitional relief has been retained in England, limiting annual increases to a maximum of 12.5%, and that Northern Ireland has withdrawn its 2010 revaluation due to the substantial changes in the economic climate; acknowledges the views of the chamber of commerce that the reintroduction of transitional relief to support businesses and an urgent review of the rating appeals process are considered vital in order to help companies in Ayrshire return to a period of growth, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support businesses in Ayrshire and help those businesses hardest hit by the revaluation.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6963 Bill Kidd: Construction of Aircraft Carriers and the Strategic Defence Review</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply concerned by the statement from the chief executive of BAE systems that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has asked him to look at options ranging from constructing no aircraft carriers to completing two aircraft carriers as part of the Strategic Defence Review; notes that work on the first carrier is well underway; agrees with trade union representatives from both the Clyde and Rosyth yards that two carriers should be built, and supports the Scottish Government and cross-party efforts to ensure that the MOD does not jeopardise thousands of jobs in what is considered Scotland&rsquo;s world-leading shipbuilding industry.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6962 George Foulkes: Edinburgh Forensics Laboratory</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the official consultation process regarding the Scottish Police Services Authority&rsquo;s (SPSA) <em>Forensic Services Modernisation Options Paper</em> has closed; further notes that it includes an option that proposes the withdrawal of what are considered key services at the Edinburgh forensic services laboratory; considers that the Edinburgh forensic services laboratory is essential to solving both low and high-level crime; acknowledges the concerns of the forensic staff, who, it considers, provide an excellent service; is concerned that the proposed cutbacks would result in a hugely reduced service for Lothians and Borders Police; believes that this would significantly hinder its ability to fight crime; further believes that the SPSA seems to be more interested in saving money and maximising the use of Gartcosh than protecting forensic services, and is of the view that, when a decision is reached, it should be presented to the Parliament for thorough scrutiny.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6958 Robin Harper: Crossing Guards Cuts Proposals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposal by Edinburgh City Council to remove 76 lollipop people in order to save &pound;300,000; believes that it is grossly unfair to target low-paid workers and that the savings could be made more fairly elsewhere; is concerned that the proposal contradicts the recently welcomed efforts to make the roads safer for pupils, parents and drivers alike, and is of the view that the withdrawal of the extra security provided by lollipop crossing guards might<em> </em>also discourage children and their parents from walking to school, and that this would be would be a regrettable development.</p>

  Ross Finnie: Hunterston Not the Way Forward for Carbon Capture</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the lodging of the application by Peel Energy Ltd to build a 1,600 megawatt coal-fired power station at Hunterston, North Ayrshire; understands that, initially, the power station is to have 400 megawatt of its gross output (300 megawatt net) processed through carbon capture and storage technology, which would leave 75% to 80% of the plant&rsquo;s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions unabated for an indeterminate length of time; considers that these unabated emissions, which could amount to up to some four million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per annum, are incompatible with the climate change targets set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, and accordingly believes that the development of carbon capture and storage technology should be restricted to existing coal-fired stations.</p>
