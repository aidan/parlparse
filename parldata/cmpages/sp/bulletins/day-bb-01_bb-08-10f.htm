            <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Arbuthnott Formula and Funding of Grampian Health 
            Board</strong>—That the Parliament notes with concern the current financial 
            pressure facing Grampian Health Board and the consequences this will 
            have for health services in the region; notes that Grampian has the 
            lowest per capita health funding in Scotland and is concerned that 
            this will continue to be the position in 2004; believes that this 
            situation is a result of the inadequacy of the Arbuthnott formula 
            at identifying the financial needs of health boards with large rural 
            populations, and therefore believes that the operation of the formula 
            should be reviewed to ensure that finance is allocated on a basis 
            that will give both rural and urban populations the same standard 
            of health care.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2105</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: 
            Greenock Morton FC</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes the agreement 
            reached by a local football consortium fronted by Professor James 
            Pickett to purchase Greenock Morton Football Club; congratulates the 
            Morton supporters and members of the local community whose generosity 
            and tireless hard work kept the club ticking over when all looked 
            lost; looks forward to the new owners of the club working in close 
            conjunction with the supporters and the local community to alleviate 
            all uncertainties and ensure that Greenock Morton’s future is secure 
            for the long-term once again, and wishes new manager Peter Cormack 
            and his players all the best for season 2001-02.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2104</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell: 
            Closure of Paisley Drugs Collection and Co-ordination Unit</strong>—That 
            the Parliament deplores the transfer of Scotland’s only HM Customs 
            and Excise drugs collection and co-ordination unit from Paisley to 
            Ipswich, the consequential loss of jobs and expertise in the west 
            of Scotland and the possible effects of the transfer on the work of 
            the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to make representations to Her Majesty’s Government to reconsider 
            this matter.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2103#</strong> <strong>Christine 
            Grahame: British Heart Foundation</strong>—That the Parliament congratulates 
            the British Heart Foundation on its 40th anniversary; notes its valuable 
            contribution to research into heart disease, which is of particular 
            consequence in Scotland given it has the highest rates of heart disease 
            in the UK among men and women under 75 and one of the worst records 
            for such deaths in western Europe; notes that 70% of its charitable 
            income is applied to research and the remainder to public education, 
            such as the Learn a Skill, Save a Life campaign, and the provision 
            of equipment such as lifesaving defibrillators, and believes that 
            an expansion of cardiac liaison nurses in the community to help bridge 
            the gap between primary and secondary care should be considered by 
            the Scottish Executive.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2102</strong> <strong>Mr David 
            Davidson: Montrose Vehicle Extravaganza</strong>—That the Parliament recognises 
            the hard work and co-operation of the Montrose Aerodrome Museum Society, 
            the Strathmore Vintage Vehicle Club, Angus Council, Tayside Police, 
            Red Cross and the Air Training Corps in making the Montrose Vehicle 
            Extravaganza such a success in the face of a difficult season for 
            the tourism industry and encourages all local authorities to support 
            community organised events that are of interest to tourists and boost 
            local economies.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2101#</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: 
            James Wilson, John Baird and Andrew Hardie</strong>—That the Parliament 
            recognises the sacrifice of the three 1820 martyrs, James Wilson from 
            Strathaven and John Baird and Andrew Hardie from Glasgow, who were 
            hung and beheaded in the 1820 rising to fight for social and economic 
            justice, workers’ rights and an independent Scottish parliament and 
            believes that the history of their struggle should be included in 
            the education curriculum in order to mark the anniversaries, on 30 
            August and 3 September, of their sacrifice for Scottish rights 181 
            years ago.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2100</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: 
            Access to Higher Education</strong>—That the Parliament recognises that 
            further attempts to increase access to higher education for applicants 
            from low income families, in the name of greater social inclusion, 
            will lead to displacement of those who currently meet the entrance 
            requirements unless there is a continued expansion in higher education 
            places; notes than any such displacement would be discriminatory and 
            unjust and work against the recommendation of both the Dearing and 
            Garrick committees that a gradual expansion of higher education places 
            was required to widen access across all social groups, and calls upon 
            the Scottish Executive to ensure that university entrance is based 
            on merit and that any measures to increase access for individuals 
            from low income families are achieved through increased numbers of 
            university places and not through discrimination against students 
            with better academic qualifications.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2099#</strong> <strong>Margaret 
            Jamieson: Nursery Nurses</strong>—That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">recognises 
            the valuable contribution of nursery nurses in the provision of early 
            years education and the significant impact which the Regulation of 
            Care (Scotland) Act 2001 will have in relation to this contribution; 
            congratulates the public services union UNISON on its campaign to 
            raise the profile of nursery nurses, and looks forward to the success 
            of the on-going discussions between UNISON and employers to create 
            a career structure for nursery nurses which is appropriately remunerated.</a><strong><i>
