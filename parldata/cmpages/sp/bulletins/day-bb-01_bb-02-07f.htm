            Harper: Renewable Energy</strong>—That the Parliament recognises that (a) 

            Scotland’s renewable energy resources have been recorded as being 

            the best in Europe; (b) there is significant potential for creating 

            employment, both through generating renewable energy and from the 

            manufacture of renewable energy generating plant; (c) community based 

            renewable energy projects would benefit rural development in particular; 

            (d) renewable energy can replace fossil fuels and nuclear energy, 

            therefore contributing to a reduction in climate change impacts from 

            greenhouse gas emissions and a reduction in the accumulation of highly 

            radioactive nuclear waste, and (e) there are certain barriers to the 

            development of Scotland’s renewable energy potential and these barriers 

            must be rapidly surmounted if Scotland is to capitalise on the potential 

            for job creation and environmental protection and therefore calls 

            on the Scottish Executive to (i) set an aspirational target for supply 

            of electricity from renewable sources of at least 22% in line with 

            the recently announced European Union target; (ii) set a further aspirational 

            target for renewable heat generating technologies and fuels such as 

            biomass and solar thermal energy; (iii) establish a Scottish Wave 

            Energy Test Site; (iv) ensure that, under the forthcoming Renewables 

            Obligation Scotland (ROS) scheme, the generation of energy from the 

            incineration of municipal waste does not qualify for support; (v) 

            ensure under ROS that small scale hydroelectricity generation and 

            refurbishment does qualify for support; (vi) ensure under ROS that 

            there is a market for wave energy; (vii) ensure under ROS that Renewable 

            Obligation Certificates (ROCs) may be issued in multiples of as low 

            as one kilowatt hour in order to facilitate the granting of ROCs for 

            domestic scale renewables and auto-generation and that ROCs are fully 

            tradable across the border with England, and (viii) urgently establish 

            a new cross-cutting team within the Scottish Executive drawing on 

            the resources of the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 

            and the Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture whose first goal 

            will be to set up a Renewable Energy Working Group headed by a new 

            Commissioner for Renewable Energy and whose remit will be to pursue 

            actively the development of renewable energy in Scotland. </font></p>
