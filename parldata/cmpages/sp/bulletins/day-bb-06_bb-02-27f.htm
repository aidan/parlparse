<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4014</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Scottish Gas Laughing All the Way to the Bank</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that Scottish Gas shareholders and directors will be laughing all the way to the bank after announcing an operating profit of &pound;1.5 billion, up 11% on the previous year, yet they have increased gas prices by 22%, plunging another 120,000 people in Scotland into fuel poverty and believes that this type of exploitation of a natural resource and of ordinary gas users merely reinforces the view that utility companies, such as Scottish Gas, should not be run for the huge individual wealth of a few, but should be publicly owned to the benefit of the many and to ensure public accountability when it comes to how much we pay to turn our fires on.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4013</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Transfer of National Savings Jobs to India</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that we are now witnessing the consequences of government privatisation of civil service departments; notes that in 1999 the UK Government privatised the National Savings Agency complex in Glasgow when 4,000 civil servants were transferred to Siemens Business Services; further notes that in 2004 the UK Government allowed Siemens to offshore 240 jobs and that now the company intends to offshore to India another 240 National Savings jobs which would mean that almost one-third of National Savings work will be carried out in India; believes that the company will not guarantee replacement work for displaced staff, and calls on UK Treasury Minister, Ivan Lewis MP, who will make the final decision on whether the jobs are transferred to India, to refuse to give his consent.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4012</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Care Home Residents Evicted</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the actions of West Dunbartonshire Council who intend to close Leven Cottage elderly care home with two remaining residents still inside; notes that the residents have been informed by the council&rsquo;s Social Work Department that from Monday 27 February 2006 the building will be closed, care staff will be withdrawn and replaced with a 24-hour security guard, the top floor will be boarded up, all kitchen appliances, with the exception of a kettle and microwave, will be disconnected and there will be no heating when the current oil supply runs out; is appalled that a local authority could behave in such a way and defends the right of Robert and Annie to remain in Leven Cottage which has been their home for decades, and further believes that the council is completely reneging on its duty of care to Annie and Robert by attempting to bully them into leaving their home.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4011#</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade Fortnight</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that Fairtrade Fortnight will take place between 6 and 19 March 2006; supports this important series of events which raises awareness of the need to provide support to workers and producers in Third World countries to get a fairer return for their produce; congratulates the growing number of towns and organisations which have succeeded in achieving the Fairtrade mark; acknowledges Burntisland&rsquo;s new signage which greets visitors to &quot;Fife&rsquo;s First FairTrade Town&quot;; notes that more fair trade products are being stocked in all major supermarkets; celebrates the increased purchasing of fair trade products by individuals and businesses, and considers that all MSPs and consumers should participate in these events which will help protect the livelihood of small farmers and producers who for too long have faced exploitation instead of reward for their labours.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4009</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>British and American Nuclear Testing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament utterly condemns the nuclear test, &quot;Krakatau&quot;, carried out jointly by the British and American governments in Nevada on 23 February 2006; understands that the results could be used to develop further nuclear capabilities; recognises that other countries are coming under unwarranted pressure not to expand their nuclear capability, and suggests that this blatant hypocrisy in no way helps to develop a mature and sensible debate on weapons of mass destruction at this critical time.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3971&lt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Mental Health and Deaf and Deafblind People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges and supports the campaign by the Scottish Council on Deafness (SCoD) for equal access to mainstream and specialist mental health services for deaf and deafblind people in Scotland; notes the widespread lack of provision for deaf and deafblind people who have specific language and communication needs and that presently their rights under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Scotland Act 2003 and Disability Discrimination Act 2005 are not being met, leading to misdiagnosis and unsuitable treatments being applied; further notes with concern the complete lack of consultant psychiatrists in Scotland who are trained and experienced to work with deaf and deafblind people who have mental health problems and that the nearest available specialist mental health service for deaf and deafblind inpatients is Manchester whose outreach service, which is currently used by Scots deaf and deafblind people, is now under threat of closure; endorses the campaign for a specialist mental health service for deaf and deafblind people in Scotland, funded through the NHS, and SCoD&rsquo;s aim of providing support for training and recruiting of deaf and deafblind people to enable them to work with deaf and deafblind patients; backs SCoD&rsquo;s call for additional resourcing for mainstream psychiatric services in both hospital and community settings which would lead to greater accessibility for deaf and deafblind people with mental health problems, and recommends the establishment of a specialist Scottish centre for deaf and deafblind people with mental health problems in the south of Scotland or other suitable region.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3890#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>The Importance of Play</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes calls from Play Scotland and Barnardo&rsquo;s for a play strategy that recognises the right of all children in East Renfrewshire and across Scotland to a safe, challenging and accessible play environment; is aware of the public and political concerns over levels of obesity, mental health problems and anti-social behaviour amongst children and young people; notes that lack of opportunity to play is a contributing factor to these problems; is concerned that traffic growth, loss of open space and fears over safety are further restricting play opportunities, and therefore believes that play should be supported with a vigour that reflects its importance.</p>
