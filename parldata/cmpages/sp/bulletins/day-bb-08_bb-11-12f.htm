<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2864</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the significant role that energy efficiency and microgeneration measures could have in reducing energy costs for householders and businesses, in achieving urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 80% by 2050 and contributing to the eradication of fuel poverty by 2016; notes that research carried out by the Energy Savings Trust suggests that widespread installation of microgeneration could provide 30 to 40% of our electricity needs by 2050 but that current investment in energy efficiency and microgeneration measures is insufficient to achieve these goals, and calls on the Scottish Government to take steps, as set out in the Energy Efficiency and Microgeneration Bill proposals, such as fiscal incentives for householders and businesses, to improve the energy efficiency of new and existing housing stock and ensure that microgeneration technologies become widely available and used.</p>
<p>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2863</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Health Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the emerging cuts to frontline services in Scotland&rsquo;s health service as a direct result of the SNP&rsquo;s budget settlement, which provides the NHS with its lowest spending increase since devolution; notes with concern that NHS boards across Scotland are facing extreme financial pressure as evidenced by the comments of NHS Highland that it needs to find savings that &quot;would mean consideration of issues that were previously thought to be scary or untouchable&quot;; further notes that NHS Shetland is reviewing the number of nurses, cancer care services and mental health funding to generate budget savings and that the Director of Finance and Planning at NHS Forth Valley has reported that the size of the savings required &quot;will impact on direct patient services and on staffing levels&quot;, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent action to ensure that NHS boards receive sufficient funding in order that they are not forced to consider cuts to frontline services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2862</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Scottish Futures Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that modern infrastructure is essential to economic well-being and excellent public services in Scotland; notes actions to invest in public infrastructure set out in the&nbsp;Scottish Government&rsquo;s &pound;35 billion Infrastructure Investment Plan; notes efforts to promote collaboration among public authorities and agencies in planning and developing capital projects to maximise value for money; believes that identifying and managing risk effectively through the capital project life cycle and providing a range of approaches to structuring and financing infrastructure investment are important objectives to be pursued; notes the steps being taken by the Scottish Government to develop the non-profit distributing model for capital schemes to achieve an appropriate balance of risk and reward; believes that the establishment of the Scottish Futures Trust, with its role of maximising value for money by facilitating and encouraging effective and efficient investment in public infrastructure schemes, is in the public interest, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the Scottish Futures Trust makes a full contribution to these objectives.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2861</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>On the Money (Leis an Airgead)</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the authors of <em>On the Money</em>, Theresa Breslin, Jonathan Meres, Nicola Morgan and Alison Prince, on the successful translation of their book from English into Gaelic; recognises the importance of this book, which teaches children the importance of being financially aware; further recognises the involvement of Standard Life, the Scottish Book Trust and Learning and Teaching Scotland in the project, and congratulates Condorrat Primary School in Cumbernauld on its successful hosting of the launch of the Gaelic translation of <em>On the Money</em> in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2860</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>
<p>Wednesday 19 November 2008</p>
<p><strong>2.30 pm&#9;</strong>Time for Reflection</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2859</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>New Homes for Maryhill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the 1,000th home built under a programme to provide homes across the city of Glasgow was recently unveiled in Maryhill; welcomes the fact that this forms part of a new &pound;5 million development of 49 flats and houses provided by Maryhill Housing Association, Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Housing Association, and further recognises that this is the latest phase of Maryhill Housing Association&rsquo;s ongoing development programme of building homes in Maryhill and Ruchill to provide local homes for local people.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2858</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery in raising over &pound;1 million for charities in Scotland in its first year in existence; welcomes the fact that funding is unrestricted so that its charity partners, Scottish Wildlife Trust, Children 1st and Maggie&rsquo;s Cancer Care Centres, can spend the money with complete independence; notes that the money raised so far equates to funding a Maggie&rsquo;s Centre for one year, supporting the Children 1st Parent Line service for 12 months and maintaining the Scottish Wildlife Trust&rsquo;s network of over 120 reserves across Scotland<font color="#0000ff">; </font>further welcomes the fact that all funds raised in Scotland stay in Scotland, and supports the future growth of the lottery so that other charities can benefit from this invaluable source of funding.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2857</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>A Right Belter</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery, a lottery for charities in Scotland that was launched in November 2007 and has since raised over &pound;1 million for Maggie&rsquo;s Cancer Care Centres, Children 1st and the Scottish Wildlife Trust; further notes that on St Andrew&rsquo;s day the Postcode Belter will see the biggest prize pot so far with a cool &pound;1 million going to the lucky winners, and wishes all Scots the best of luck on the day.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2856</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Good Luck Bankier Primary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes Bankier Primary School in Banknock the best of luck as it competes in the final of STV&rsquo;s People&rsquo;s Millions competition; notes that its entry, an Eco Attack project, will transform part of the grounds of the school into a multi-use area for the local community, which will include work on a garden, installing a climbing wall, building shelters and providing benches made from plastic bottles, and hopes that it is successful on 27 November 2008 in making this project a reality.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2855</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>UK Nationality and Place of Birth - Gender-Discrimination</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that children born before 1983 outwith the United Kingdom to British mothers, unlike those born outwith the United Kingdom to British fathers, cannot automatically obtain British citizenship through their parents&rsquo; nationality and believes that such discrimination by the UK Government is not only unwarranted but unjust.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2854</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Mindroom</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Scottish learning difficulties charity Mindroom has launched a major campaign aimed at securing more integrated support for children and adults with learning difficulties; notes the research indicating that more than one-in-six children has a recognised learning difficulty and calls for greater medical and statistical research in this area; strongly supports Mindroom&rsquo;s focus on integrating support for people with learning difficulties under three pillars, namely, assessment and diagnosis, research and development, and education and training; believes that the creation of centres combining these facilities under one roof represents a potentially revolutionary way of supporting people with learning difficulties and their families, and would welcome creation of the world&rsquo;s first such Mindroom in Scotland, allowing Scotland to take a global lead in promoting integrated support for those with learning difficulties.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2853.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2853) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from second &quot;and&quot; to end and insert &quot;; notes the actions already taken by the Scottish Government but believes that the current recession is in part attributable to the mismanagement of the UK economy by the present UK Government and the era of irresponsibility over which it has presided, evidenced by the record levels of government borrowing, regulatory failure and the taxation of pension schemes, which has discouraged saving and investment, and welcomes the measures approved by this Parliament, such as business rates relief and the council tax freeze, which will help businesses and households to maximise jobs and investment and provide a basis for Scotland to take early and speedy advantage of any recovery.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2853.2</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2853) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the urgent need for a response from government at all levels and the degree of support that exists for an emphasis on public investment as a route to recovery; rejects the idea that the existing and failed models of economic growth through fossil fuel dependence can simply be refloated; believes that for any recovery to be truly sustainable the priority must be given to investment projects that specifically assist the transition to a low-carbon, high-skill economy; understands that such an economy will enable resilient local communities to meet more of their needs from local resources; considers that the current economic situation, for all the difficulties it presents in Scotland, also offers an opportunity to rebalance the global economy around the principles of fair trade and ecological justice through supportive not exploitative relationships with developing countries, and urges the UK Government to take this opportunity to honour promises given at Gleneagles to lift the burden of international debt.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2853.3</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2853) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;across&quot; to end and insert &quot;; deeply regrets the lack of early and decisive action by the Scottish Government in response to this downturn; recognises that its much trumpeted six-point plan is little more than re-announced promises; welcomes the growing consensus across all the major parties that tax cuts are a positive and effective way to energise the economy, and calls on the Scottish Government to revise the operating plan of Scottish Enterprise, restore local economic development and support to small businesses, make a statement on how capital projects are being accelerated and use the tax-varying powers at its disposal to implement the Liberal Democrats&rsquo; proposed 2p reduction in the basic rate of Scottish income tax to deliver more than &pound;300 per year into the pay packet of the average Scottish earner and a significant fiscal stimulus to the economy.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2853.4</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2853) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward measures that will make a real difference to Scottish families, such as reintroducing adult apprenticeship funding across all sectors, improving the services provided by Partnership Action for Continuing Employment to ensure a proactive approach to matching up people with job opportunities, and to ditch plans for a local income tax, which organisations such as STUC and CBI agree would be bad for families, business and enterprise.&quot;</p>
