          <p><strong><a name="858"></a>*S2M-858#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> 
            <strong>Approval of Inward Delegation</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            believes that delegations representing governments and states throughout 
            the world should be welcomed by the Parliament in general; recognises, 
            however, that there may be regimes abhorrent to members that such 
            members believe it inappropriate to welcome; is concerned to note 
            that members may debate, in the chamber, the merits or otherwise of 
            going to war on a state but currently have no facility to debate whether 
            it is appropriate to welcome the representatives of that state to 
            the Parliament; believes that these contradictions undermine the integrity 
            of the Parliament and further believes that, where a member expresses 
            an objection to a delegation, the Parliament should be able to vote 
            on the matter.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="857"></a>*S2M-857#</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon:</strong> 
            <strong>Livingston Football Club</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the news that Livingston Football Club has been 
            placed in administration; recognises the considerable success that 
            the club has achieved both on the field and in promoting West Lothian; 
            hopes that all relevant parties work to bring the club out of administration 
            at the earliest opportunity, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should enter into discussions with the Scottish Premier League and 
            other relevant bodies to identify ways in which the current crisis 
            situation facing many Scottish clubs can be resolved.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="856"></a>*S2M-856#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> 
            <strong>Topless Hairdressing Salons</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            deplores plans by Urban Group to establish a topless hairdressing 
            salon staffed by young women in the Paisley area; notes with concern 
            the lack of legislation to prevent such an establishment from opening, 
            and considers, therefore, that the Scottish Executive should introduce 
            legislation to enable local authorities to address the opening of 
            such establishments in Scotland&#8217;s towns and cities.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="855"></a>*S2M-855</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> 
            <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the consistent underperformance of the Scottish economy 
            relative to that of the UK as a whole; recognises that the burdens 
            of higher rates, water charges and regulation faced by businesses 
            in Scotland are factors contributing to this underperformance, and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to take immediate steps to create 
            a more business friendly environment by reducing business rates and 
            water charges and cutting red tape, thereby encouraging business development, 
            improving the outlook for economic growth, and contributing to a reverse 
            in Scotland&#8217;s trend of population decline.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-854#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Student 
            Community Relations</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament commends the 
            efforts of Edinburgh University Students&#8217; Association in organising 
            the Edinburgh Student Festival and a community forum as a means to 
            improving community relations between students and those they live 
            around in Edinburgh and supports all efforts to encourage harmony 
            in communities that include students.</p>

          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-850#</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Tackling 
            Debt</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament welcomes recent research into 
            debt by Citizens Advice Scotland, published in <em>On the cards &#8211; 
            Scottish Citizens Advice Bureaux clients experiences of debt</em>; 
            notes the findings of the report such as the increasing level of debt 
            stress experienced by clients highlighted by the fact that the average 
            debt client owes &#163;22 for every &#163;1 of monthly income, the 
            prevalence of consumer debt across every income group and the role 
            of changes in circumstances such as job loss, illness and relationship 
            breakdown in creating debt problems; further notes the implications 
            of this research for the debt arrangement scheme brought forward under 
            the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Act 2002, particularly 
            the low levels of surplus income available to many debtors to make 
            repayments to their debts and the unacceptable levels of pressure 
            and harassment experienced by some debtors as creditors compete to 
            get repayment of their debts, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should take action to ensure that all debtors, even those with limited 
            surplus incomes, are able to access the debt arrangement scheme to 
            gain protection from undue creditor harassment and unnecessary debt 
            enforcement action and recognise and support the valuable role played 
            by citizens advice bureaux in advising those with debt problems.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="849"></a>*S2M-849</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> 
            <strong>Police Accountability</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes 
            that there is widespread public misunderstanding of who is responsible 
            for what in terms of policing in Scotland; recognises that there needs 
            to be greater local involvement in policing along with a police service 
            that is more responsive to public demands, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to strengthen public accountability and involvement by considering 
            ideas such as the direct election of conveners of police boards and 
            the regular publication of localised crime statistics.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-848</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Tenements 
            (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament agrees to the general 
            principles of the Tenements (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong>, 
            Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-847#</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> <strong>VisitScotland 
            Tourist Information</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes the criticisms 
            from the tourism industry about the performance and operation of the 
            visitscotland.com website; in particular, notes the concerns among 
            some operators about the negative impact the website is having on 
            their custom due to technical problems with the site, the high cost 
            of subscription, the apparent lack of reliable information in some 
            instances and the cost in lost tourism; recognises how important tourism 
            is to the Scottish economy, and therefore considers that the Scottish 
            Executive and VisitScotland must ensure that these problems are resolved 
            ahead of the 2004 tourist season.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-788.1</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Energy 
            Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&#8212;As an amendment to motion (S2M-788) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out &quot;agrees&quot; and insert 
            &quot;believes that the Energy Bill as proposed will disadvantage 
            the Scottish renewables industry, endanger the Scottish Executive&#8217;s 
            targets for renewable energy development, establish a UK Nuclear Decommissioning 
            Agency for the management and handling of radioactive waste with no 
            environmental objectives and maintain the current lack of Executive 
            powers over stored radioactive waste; considers that these issues 
            of concern could be resolved through consultation with Her Majesty&#8217;s 
            Government to the satisfaction of this Parliament, and therefore until 
            those issues have been resolved does not agree.&quot;</p>
