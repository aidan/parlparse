<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3921</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Scottish SPCA&rsquo;s Rehoming Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes and supports the Scottish SPCA&rsquo;s Rehoming Week from 20 to 26 April 2009, which hopes to increase awareness of the variety of animals that are in care and in need of homes; recognises that the Scottish SPCA, a purely Scottish charity, is the only animal welfare charity that rescues every kind of animal in Scotland, including dogs, cats, rabbits and less common pets such as reptiles, rodents, birds and exotic animals, and notes that rehoming is predicated on suitable and responsible ownership.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3920</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Carers&rsquo; Poverty, Enough is Enough</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the carers&rsquo; poverty protest on 22 April 2009; considers that the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, at &pound;53.10 per week, is the lowest of the earnings replacement benefits; initially calls on the UK Government to make an urgent increase to this allowance to bring it more in line with other earnings replacements benefits, and calls for a wider review of the benefits for carers and, in particular, the position of pensioners with regard to the overlapping rule between the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and the state retirement pension.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3919</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to James Lillis, Winner of the 4th STUC Helen Dowie Award for Lifelong Learning</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates James Lillis of Unite the Union on winning the prestigious Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) Helen Dowie Award for Lifelong Learning in recognition of his tireless work in supporting and encouraging others to participate in learning; notes in particular his immense contribution to supporting a learning culture in his own workplace at First Glasgow; celebrates his commitment to integration in the workplace and his key role in helping migrant workers integrate into the broader community; appreciates his efforts in partnership with Unite the Union, First Glasgow, Renfrewshire Buddies, Adam Smith College and the learners themselves in making his workplace learning centre a success; salutes James Lillis as an inspiration in making possible for his fellow workers the reality of learning and community involvement, and congratulates the STUC and trade unionists across Scotland on the priority that they give to learning in the workplace.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3918</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Lambhill Stables</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the groundbreaking ceremony that took place at Lambhill Stables on 16 April 2009; also notes the innovative environmental-based learning that the project seeks to make available to the local community, and wishes the project well in its bid to obtain funding to allow the restoration of the historic Lambhill Stables.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3917</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Proposed School Closures by Glasgow City Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the Save Our Schools campaign mounted by the parents of the five schools proposed for closure in the Glasgow Maryhill constituency; acknowledges the detrimental impact that such closures would have on local communities throughout the area; considers the arguments against closure to be compelling and well made, and hopes that, even at this late stage in the process, those arguments will prevail at the council meeting on 23 April 2009.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3916</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>School Closures by Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s Labour Administration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled at the decision of Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s Labour administration to recommend the closure of 20 primary and nursery schools across the city and to disregard the views of local communities, particularly in Wyndford and Cadder, which continue to campaign so persuasively against the closures; notes the apparent abandonment by the council of the commitment in its single outcome agreement to provide parents and carers with access to high quality education and childcare within &quot;buggy pushing distance&quot; of their homes; recognises the need to reduce under-occupancy in city schools but considers that this should have been done on a basis that builds on local communities and retains a community school comprising both non-denominational and denominational traditions, and urges all councillors to support this approach at the council meeting on 23 April 2009.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3913</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Public Opposition to Privacy Infringement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the results of a recent survey, conducted on behalf of the <em>Metro</em> newspaper by www.PoliticsHome.com, which indicates that 60% of those surveyed disapprove of a new EU directive that requires that all communications, including phone calls, emails and internet usage, are recorded and stored for one year and that 58% of those surveyed agreed with the statement that &quot;There is no such thing as secure data storage. It inevitably gets into the wrong hands&quot;; believes that the concerns of the general public are well placed considering a spate of data blunders by UK Government departments in recent years, which includes the loss in 2007 of data discs that contained the personal details of 25 million people; believes that the UK Government must take heed of the growing public concern at moves to curb personal privacy and individual civil liberties, and calls on the UK Government to work against efforts at wide-scale monitoring of personal communications.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3559#</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Future of the Sunday Mail and Daily Record</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of Trinity Mirror to merge the editorial content of the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail</em> with the loss of up to 30% of journalistic staff, based primarily in Glasgow and the west of Scotland; recognises that both newspapers are an integral part of Scottish culture and that to diminish their individual identities would be a serious blow to the diversity, vibrancy and quality of the Scottish media; believes that the loss of their separate identities would undoubtedly lead to the erosion of circulation at both titles, leading inevitably to further job losses; considers that Trinity Mirror is highly profitable and that there is no need to undertake such drastic restructuring, and therefore very much hopes that good sense may prevail over the future of two of Scotland&rsquo;s leading titles.</p>
