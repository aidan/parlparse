            "expresses support for sustainable aquaculture and recognises the 
            sector's vital economic contribution to Scotland; urges the industry 
            to strive continually to achieve the highest environmental standards 
            and welcomes progress already made; believes that the regulatory framework 
            must be guided by well-resourced science; further believes that lessons 
            must be learnt from other countries on the streamlining and simplification 
            of the regulatory framework and is disappointed that this is one of 
            many issues that the strategy fails to address adequately; calls for 
            the powers currently exercised by the Crown Estate to be transferred 
            to the Parliament, and further calls for the early introduction of 
            legislation transferring planning control to local authorities in 
            order to enhance openness and accountability to ensure that local 
            communities have a say over the siting of fish farms. " </P>

            end and insert &quot;but regrets that the strategic framework for 
            Scottish aquaculture increasingly looks more like a straightjacket, 
            with no fewer than eight bodies currently overseeing it, and further 
            regrets that the Executive has failed to make meaningful financial 
            provision to the industry in terms of research and development, especially 
            of new species and has failed to protect the quality &quot;Scottish&quot; 
            brand for farmed salmon and failed to safeguard the 6,500 Scottish 
            jobs in salmon farming by its inadequate approach to dumping of inferior
