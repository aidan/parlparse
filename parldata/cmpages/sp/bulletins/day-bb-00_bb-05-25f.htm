    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-910</b> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Social Exclusion Research</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes research of the Social Exclusion Unit (PAT 14) and other bodies
    confirming that a lack of access to short-term credit and other financial services creates
    serious problems for many low income households, who face extortionate interest rates;
    urges the Scottish Executive to develop further its joined up approach to economic
    citizenship including better access to social fund grants, improved regulation of consumer
    credit lending, better resourcing of credit unions and pressing banks to provide a more
    socially responsible service, and calls for a public debate on the issue.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-909</b> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Post Office Pension Fund</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that the Post Office has responded to a surplus in its pension fund
    by giving itself a contributions holiday for the past 13 years instead of using the
    windfall to improve the position of its pensioners; regrets that the corporation should
    follow worst industry practice in this respect and urges Post Office pension fund trustees
    to review their policy.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-908#</b> <strong>Elaine Thomson: Women's Pay - 30 Years on from the
    Equal Pay Act</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern that 30 years after the
    introduction of the Equal Pay Act women earn only 73.3% of average male earnings; notes
    further that Aberdeen has the widest discrepancy between men and women&#146;s earnings in
    Scotland, with women in Aberdeen earning only 64.2% of men&#146;s earnings; believes that
    these figures clearly show that legislation in itself has failed to deliver parity in the
    labour market; believes that the Scottish Executive and its economic development agencies
    should pursue policies that would assist in the equalisation of pay between the genders,
    and asks the Scottish Executive, whilst pursuing the creation of a knowledge economy, to
    put in place adequate monitoring and evaluation to ensure that women will become equal
    players in the labour market.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-907</b> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: East Sutherland Economy</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with concern the current and long-term problems faced in the local
    economy of Sutherland and asks the Scottish Executive to bring forward proposals for a
    multi-agency forum which could target resources, discuss possible solutions to these
    problems and prepare a report with recommendations at the earliest opportunity for
    consideration by the Parliament, the Scottish Executive and the Highlands and Islands
    Convention.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-905</b> <strong>Bill Aitken: Announcements made by the Scottish
    Executive</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that considerable confusion has been caused
    by a number of recent Scottish Executive announcements, particularly funding
    announcements; believes that the way funding announcements are made by the Scottish
    Executive has done little to further open government; notes that the Executive has allowed
    the same resources to be announced as &quot;new funding&quot; on more than one occasion,
    thus damaging public scrutiny, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to institute a new
    protocol for all public and press announcements in order that these make clear whether
    funding announced is additional resources or whether it is part of a previous funding
    package and, if it is, when and through what statement the funding was previously
    announced. </p>

    Executive of the document <i>Rural Scotland: A New Approach</i>; further notes the lack of

    policies and activities, and calls upon the Executive to acknowledge that Scotland&#146;s
    rural economy was in the past, and must continue to be in the future, based on its primary
