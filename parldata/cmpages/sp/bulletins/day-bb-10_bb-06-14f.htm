<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6565 Mary Mulligan: Boghall Parish Church 50th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the congregation and church officers of the Church of Scotland Boghall Parish Church on its 50th anniversary; notes that its first service of worship took place on 18 May 1960 in what is now the church hall; further notes the architectural importance of the church, which was designed by Wheeler and Sproson, constructed between 1960 and 1965 and includes a unique hyperbolic paraboloid roof finished internally with timber; acknowledges the many years of valuable service to the community by past Boghall Parish Church ministers Reverend Tom Milroy and Reverend John McLean; commends Boghall Parish Church for its enormous contribution to the social, cultural and spiritual life of the community of Boghall, and wishes Minister Reverend Dennis Rose, Session Clerk John Dunleavy and all of the church officers and congregation a joyous and memorable anniversary celebration event on Sunday 13 June 2010.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6564 Robin Harper: Edinburgh Eco-Schools Successes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh City Council Education Department on its support of Eco-Schools; notes that on Monday 7 June 2010 presentations were made to a number of schools for their successes, which included Portobello High School gaining its fourth Green Flag, having already been the first high school in Edinburgh to achieve a Green Flag nine years ago; notes that 98% of all schools in Edinburgh are registered as Eco-Schools, 35 local authority schools have achieved Green Flag awards and 273 local authority schools are presently at bronze and silver level; notes that Eco-Schools provides schools with a framework linking all nine topics and seven elements to the new Curriculum for Excellence at all levels, and urges Edinburgh City Council Education Department and the Scottish Government to continue to support Eco-Schools at the highest possible level.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6563 Robin Harper: Curriculum for Excellence and Eco-schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Eco-Schools Scotland on its recent successes and notes the huge contribution that it is already making to the roll-out of the new Curriculum for Excellence;  further notes that 98% of all schools in Scotland are now registered as Eco-Schools and that  this makes Scotland the leading country in the world among the 50  countries so far signed up to Eco-Schools International; notes also that Scotland will be hosting the International Eco-Schools conference in Edinburgh in November 2010; notes that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, Michael Russell MSP, recently attended the presentation of the 1,000th Green Flag to be awarded in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Government to ring-fence financial support for Keep Scotland Beautiful and Eco-Schools Scotland in view of their combined contribution to sustainability and education.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6562 Robert Brown: Eye Health Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes National Eye Health Week running from 14 to 20 June 2010; notes the importance of ensuring a high level of awareness of eye health; believes that the early detection of conditions that could contribute to sight loss and impairment is essential not only for the wellbeing of the individual but because such intervention could reduce future costs to the public purse, in particular to the health and social care budgets; recognises that Scotland has exemplary eye health services that have been made possible through leading innovations such as free eye tests, and congratulates all those involved in the eye care sector for the professional and dedicated work they carry out.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6539 Bill Kidd: Welfare Reform and Means-testing of DLA</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has stated in his speech, <em>Welfare for the 21st Century,</em> that &quot;&hellip; for some people, the move from welfare into work means they face losing more than 95 pence for every additional &pound;1 they earn. As a result, the poor are in effect being taxed at an effective rate that far exceeds the wealthy.&quot;; is of the firm opinion that, while welcoming any reduction in taxation or benefit withdrawal rate on poor people, it should not be funded by a reduction in other benefits; believes in particular that Disability Living Allowance (DLA) should not be made means-tested, as was suggested in the paper, <em>Dynamic Benefits</em>, in its proposal for a Universal Life Credit, which &quot;would be a simple means-tested benefit that provides additional income to those on low or no earnings. It would replace Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit, Child Tax Credit and Disability Living Allowance&quot;, and is of the view that DLA is a benefit that all people who meet the relevant disability criteria should be allowed to continue receiving.</p>
