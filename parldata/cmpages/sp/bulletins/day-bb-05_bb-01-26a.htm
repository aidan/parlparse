                <p> S2M-2298 Malcolm Chisholm: <strong>Older People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the contribution that older people bring to our communities; recognises the substantial progress that has been made in meeting the needs of older people through policies such as free personal and nursing care, the central heating programme and free bus travel anywhere in Scotland at any time of day; welcomes other policy initiatives that benefit older people by promoting volunteering and lifelong learning and tackling anti-social behaviour; seeks to build on these by recognising the diversity of older people and tackling ageism, and welcomes the involvement of older people through the Older People&rsquo;s Consultative Forum, and in other ways, in the development of policy across the Scottish Executive. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p> S2M-2298.1 Christine Grahame:<strong> Older People</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S2M-2298) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from second &ldquo;recognises&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;for example, as role models, carers and volunteers; recognises the progress that has been made through policies such as free personal care, the central heating programme and the commitment to national free bus travel by 2006; considers, however, that the state pension is inadequate for a basic living standard and requires to be supplemented by the means-tested pension credit which some 30% of pensioners fail to claim; notes that one in five pensioners live in poverty, with some 70% in council tax poverty, and that excess winter mortality rates are three times higher in Scotland than in Germany and Sweden, and asserts that, without an increase in the powers of the Parliament to deliver a citizen&rsquo;s pension providing a decent standard of living which will bring security, dignity, independence and choice, improvements to the lives of Scotland&rsquo;s elderly can only be at the margins.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> S2M-2298.3 Mary Scanlon:<strong> Older People</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S2M-2298) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from second &ldquo;recognises&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;acknowledges that substantial progress needs to be made to meet the needs of older people which achieves a sustainable funding agreement to reduce bed-blocking and to end the inequality in funding between council-run homes and independent homes; calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that all elderly people assessed for free personal and nursing care are given the appropriate care in the environment which suits their needs, either at home or in residential care; acknowledges the central heating programme and free bus travel anywhere in Scotland; looks to the Executive to propose policy initiatives that benefit older people by promoting volunteering and lifelong learning and tackling anti-social behaviour, and calls on the Executive to build on these by recognising the diversity of older people and tackling ageism and encouraging the greater involvement of older people through the Older People&rsquo;s Consultative Forum, and in other ways, in the development of policy across the Scottish Executive.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> S2M-2298.2 John Swinburne:<strong> Older People</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S2M-2298) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &ldquo;, accepts that, despite these actions, there remains a growing problem of the ageing population demographic timebomb and believes that, without immediate, positive Executive action, many older people will continue to be adversely affected and die in this wealthy society in the 21 st century.&rdquo; </p>
              <p> <em>followed by</em> Motion on Railways Bill &ndash; UK Legislation&mdash; </p>
              <p> <a name="2244" id="2244"></a>S2M-2244 Nicol Stephen: <strong>Railways Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that those provisions that confer executive powers and functions on the Scottish Ministers in the Railways Bill and those that relate to devolved matters should be considered by the UK Parliament. </p>
