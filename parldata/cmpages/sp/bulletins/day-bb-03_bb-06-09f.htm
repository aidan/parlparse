            of the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish 
            Poisoning) (Orkney) (Scotland) Order (SSI 2003/260), recommends that

          <p> <strong>*S2M-116#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Aberdeen Council 
            Housing Debt Write-Off</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            Treasury-led write-off of Glasgow City Council's housing debt; regrets 
            the linking of that action to the wholesale transfer of the council's 
            housing stock; applauds the overwhelming rejection of such a wholesale 
            stock transfer by Aberdeen City Council's tenants, and expects that 
            a similar debt write-off will be made to benefit Aberdeen City Council's 
            housing tenants and to allow the council to invest more in its stock.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-115#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner: National Beds 
            Inquiry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that the number of 
            NHS beds has been reduced by over 5,000 since the mid-1990s and that 
            this policy continues today as shown in the Greater Glasgow NHS Board 
            area where the number of acute beds may be reduced by 11% from 2001 
            to 2005 despite the number of acute admissions increasing; is concerned 
            at the result of this reduction which will mean that patients will 
            have to wait on trolleys until a bed becomes available, sometimes 
            for up to eight hours or longer; believes that this delay exposes 
            patients, who may be lying in a public place on uncomfortable and 
            inappropriate mattresses, to an increased risk of infection with people 
            passing through and also imposes unnecessary additional demands on 
            nursing staff who have to provide food and water to these patients 
            as well as provide treatment to them, such as frequent turning to 
            prevent pressure points and venous stasis, a pre-cursor to deep venous 
            thrombosis, as a result of the patient being kept in a restricted 
            position for long periods; believes that, rather than increasing the 
            number of hospital trolleys for patients to lie on in busy corridors, 
            the number of acute hospital beds must be increased urgently in order 
            to offer a safe and comfortable bed in the appropriate ward with the 
            appropriate nursing and medical care that each patient requires which 
            would also free up accident and emergency departments to carry on 
            with the treatment of other patients; further believes that beds are 
            important in maintaining effective medical and surgical provision 
            for day or short-stay patients, and therefore considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should institute a national beds inquiry to establish how 
            many beds within each speciality are available, and are required, 
            so that emergency admissions are afforded the proper level of care 
            and elective work can be accommodated within the bed capacity in order 
            to allow waiting times and lists to be reduced.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-113</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: Amicus Scottish 
            Cup Final</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Hibernian

            completing a day of women&#146;s and girls&#146; football at Almondvale 
            Stadium; notes that women&#146;s and girls&#146; football is one of

            links between schools and local clubs to provide new opportunities 
            at every level of the game in Scotland, and welcomes the involvement 
            of Amicus in supporting equality in sport as well as in the workplace.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-112#</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Stranraer to Cairnryan 
            Rail Link</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the proposal of 
            P&amp;O and Stena Line to operate a joint port at Cairnryan from which 
            the premier British ferry crossings to Northern Ireland will operate; 
            further notes that, following the implementation of this proposal, 
            there will be no sailings from, or to, the port of Stranraer, and 
            therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should examine the 
            possibilities of restoring the rail link between Stranraer and Cairnryan 
            for the benefit of both public and freight transport alike and the 
            relief of the already fragile roads infrastructure in that region.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-111</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Inaugural

            the inaugural Scots Traditional Music Awards which will take place 
            on 13 September 2003; notes the high calibre of nominations across 
            all 15 categories; is confident that the existence of these awards 
            will highlight the extent and diversity of Scottish traditional music, 
            song, dance and languages, and looks forward to traditional music 
            gaining a more prominent profile in the future cultural life of Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-110</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Valuing Carers</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the hard work and dedication of Scotland's 
            115,675 unpaid carers, a workforce comparable to the total NHS workforce 
            in Scotland; acknowledges the role of Scotland's carer population 
            as partners in the provision of care; recognises the measures outlined 
            in <em>Partnership for Care: Scotland&#146;s Health White Paper</em> 
            and in the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 to increase 
            partnership working across the health and social care services; notes 
            that the health and well-being of many carers are affected as a direct 
            consequence of the physical and emotional strains of caring; welcomes 
            the dedication of care assistants across Scotland in providing vital

            network of 30,000 Princess Royal Trust for Carers centres on the level 
            of support that they provide to carers and their families; recognises 
            that there are many more unidentified carers in Scotland and that, 
            for appropriate support to be administered, these carers must be identified; 
            further welcomes the publication of <em>Focus on Carers and the NHS 
            - identifying and supporting hidden carers - Good Practice Guide </em>by 
            the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and the strategies for identifying

            calls upon the Prime Minister to establish an independent public inquiry 
            into the intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction, which 
            was used by Her Majesty&#146;s Government to justify the invasion

            and family support group in Stranraer for families in Wigtownshire 
            whose lives have been affected by drug or alcohol abuse; commends 
            the dedication, enthusiasm and commitment of the volunteers whose 
            dedication and personal experience has led to the establishment of 
            the YANA centre, and welcomes the services and support offered by

            the publication of the Scottish European Pollutant Emission Register 
            by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; recognises that this 
            is an important component of a strategy to deliver environmental justice 
            in Scotland; notes that all communities have a right to know about 
            chemical emissions in their environment; further notes that, in the 
            United States, the introduction of the Toxic Release Inventory resulted 
            in emission reductions of over 40%, and looks forward to the rapid 
            development and publication of a comprehensive and easily accessible

          <p><strong>S2M-105#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Future of Europe</strong>&#151;That

            the Future of Europe to delivering a more accountable, democratic 
            and transparent Europe committed to the peace and prosperity of its 
            citizens; extends the hand of friendship to the new incoming member 
            states; recognises the opportunities presented by European enlargement 
            for Scottish business; notes the role that European inter-regional 
            co-operation plays in expanding the cultural and linguistic horizons 
            of many of Scotland's young people; acknowledges the contribution 
            that the European Union has made to improving our environment, enhancing 
            workers rights and tackling the fight against poverty, and congratulates 
            the European Youth Parliament for the contribution that it has made 
            to the Future of Europe debate over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-104#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Dumfries and 
            Galloway Housing Partnership</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses 
            concern that Dumfries and Galloway Housing Partnership has changed 
            its allocations policy without consultation with tenants or local 
            councillors; believes that the operation of housing associations that 
            have received housing stock from councils through large-scale stock 
            transfer should be transparent; further believes, therefore, that 
            the minutes of the boards of such housing associations should be made 
            available to tenants&#146; groups and local authorities; believes 
            that local councillors should be permitted to discuss with housing 
            association officials the housing needs of their individual constituents, 
            and considers that Dumfries and Galloway Housing Partnership, as the 
            largest provider of social housing in the region, should work closely 
            with Dumfries and Galloway Council to improve housing services in 
            the area.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-101</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: Independent Inquiry 
            into the War on Iraq</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            that when it voted to support war on Iraq it was persuaded to do so 
            by the Prime Minister&#146;s assertions of proof of the existence 
            of 200 sites of weapons of mass destruction and of his knowledge of 
            such weapons ready and available for launch within a 45-minute period; 
            further recognises that no such weapons have been discovered; notes 
            the widespread concern in the country about Government deception in 
            gathering support for war, and joins the calls being made for a full 
            independent inquiry into the Government&#146;s conduct leading up 
            to the initiation of war.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-100</strong> <strong>John Swinburne: Recognition of 
            Kinship Care</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that many 
            grandparents have become the new foster care parents of children whose 
            mothers and fathers have become disconnected from mainstream society; 
            acknowledges that such care arrangements are more stable and have 
            a positive impact on the young person as a result of grandparents&#146; 
            strong sense of values in respect of providing care, but share concerns 
            about the financial consequences experienced by grandparents in providing 
            this care, should they have to leave work early or reduce their working 
            hours, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise 
            this form of kinship care by giving it the attention and social work 
            resources that it deserves and by making recommendations to Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government to offer these grandparents, many of whom are pensioners, 
            the same level of financial support as other foster carers.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-70.1# Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Maternity Services 
            in Glasgow </strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-70) in the name 
            of Pauline McNeill , insert at end "and supports the continuing provision 
            of full maternity services across three sites in Glasgow".</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-69#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Fair Credit Schemes</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the recently published in-depth report into 
            personal debt in the UK, <em>In Too Deep</em>, produced by the citizens 
            advice bureau (CAB) service in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern 
            Ireland; acknowledges the Scottish context of the report; notes with 
            concern the report's findings that more people in Scotland blamed 
            low incomes than elsewhere in the UK and more people coped with their 
            debt problem by taking out further borrowing than elsewhere in the 
            UK; further notes that personal debt is nearly always connected to 
            other problems in people&#146;s lives such as loss of job or ill-health; 
            notes that the number of debt cases brought to citizens advice bureaux 
            in Scotland is at an all-time high with nearly 60,000 new debt enquiries 
            last year; recognises the link between CAB clients and MSPs&#146; 
            constituents and therefore supports the invaluable work of Scotland&#146;s 
            CAB service as a vital provider of free, independent, impartial and 
            comprehensive advice and as the leading voice on the issue of personal 
            debt in Scotland today; welcomes the commitments in <em>A Partnership 
            for a Better Scotland</em> to support the extension of the money advice 
            service, building on the work of the CAB and other bodies to assist 
            those burdened by multiple debt, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should increase access to affordable credit for people on very low 
            incomes and, as a matter of urgency, take action on the commitment 
            from <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland </em>to work with the 
            Department of Trade and Industry to introduce fairer credit schemes 
            and protection from exorbitant interest rates.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-34#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Closure of Animal 
            Welfare Centres</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned about 
            the possible closure of at least seven of the 13 animal welfare centres 
            across Scotland owing to financial difficulties being experienced 
            by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA); 
            believes that this would be detrimental to animal welfare; notes with 
            relief that the SSPCA board of management has postponed making a final 
            decision on the closures of the centres for a further six months, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should hold urgent discussions 
            with the SSPCA to try to find a way of keeping the animal welfare 
            centres open.</p>
