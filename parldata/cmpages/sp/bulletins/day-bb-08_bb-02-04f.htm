<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1286</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Rising Energy Prices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the move from energy providers Npower, EDF and British Gas to increase prices over recent months and condemns the decision of providers to increase energy tariffs by up to 15%; acknowledges that such moves make it inevitable that the remaining power companies will raise prices by several times the rate of inflation, leading to increased levels of fuel poverty for many of Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable people; further notes Energywatch&rsquo;s belief that there is no reasonable explanation for the recent sharp increases in wholesale costs, and calls on gas and electricity suppliers to reinvest more of their profits, lowering prices for the most vulnerable customers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1285</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the official opening of the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre at Gartnaval hospital in Glasgow; applauds the great work done by all the organisations involved in the project, including the Friends of the Beatson, Trades House of Glasgow, the Robertson Trust, Macmillan Cancer Support and the Teenage Cancer Trust; notes that this state-of-the-art centre, which enjoys some of the shortest waiting times for radical treatment in the United Kingdom, incorporates a mix of innovative services, such as a cinema, hairdressers, chill-out rooms and therapy rooms, aimed at ensuring that patients&rsquo; experiences are as positive as possible, and commends all the staff for their great dedication and excellent work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1284</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>An End to the Prospect of Ship-to-Ship Transfers in the Firth of Forth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes Forth Ports plc&rsquo;s decision not to proceed with plans for ship-to-ship oil transfers in the Firth of Forth; congratulates the people, communities, and local groups in Fife and the Lothians who worked hard to secure this outcome; highlights the hard work of representatives across parties in both the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments on the issue of ship-to-ship oil transfers, and welcomes the protection that this decision will offer to the wildlife and environmentally sensitive sites throughout the Firth of Forth.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1283</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Buckie Community High School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff and pupils of Buckie Community High School on their efforts to become one of the greenest schools in the country; notes it is one of only 100 schools from across the whole country to be selected to install rooftop solar panels through the Co-operative Group&rsquo;s &pound;1 million Green Energy for Schools scheme; further notes that a monitor will be installed to display the amount of electricity generated and CO2 emissions being saved, and recognises that the panels will reduce the school&rsquo;s reliance on fossil fuels at a time when costs are rising and will also support course work in subjects such as geography and science.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1236</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Improving Services and Support for People with Dementia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the findings of the report, <em>Improving Services and Support for People with Dementia</em><U>,</U> by the House of Commons&rsquo; Committee of Public Accounts; accepts that while the report is focused on the provision of care services in England, many of its findings can be applied to Scotland; agrees with the report that early diagnosis is essential for planning the long-term care needs of dementia patients; expresses concern that only 31% of GPs consider themselves to have received basic training in the diagnosis and management of dementia; acknowledges that the number of dementia patients in Scotland is expected to rise to an estimated 108,000 by 2031; recognises that, in order to respond to this increase, substantial improvements must be made to meet the highest standards of community and health care; notes that the Scottish Government has made dementia a national priority; further notes that, unlike for cancer, there is no lead clinician with responsibility for dementia, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to create a dementia tsar with responsibility for improving dementia services in both the community and care homes and for creating a long-term dementia strategy to meet future challenges.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1233</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Speedy Progress Required On Haudagain Roundabout in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the <em>Aberdeen Evening Express&rsquo; </em>campaign, &quot;Our Fight to Fix Jam&quot;, which aims to speed up action to tackle traffic congestion at the Haudagain roundabout; notes that the roundabout is among Scotland&rsquo;s worst congestion hotspots, costing businesses every year and causing considerable delays to commuters; notes that it has been estimated that the Haudagain could now be costing the north-east economy upwards of &pound;30 million a year in lost productivity, trade and extra fuel for the 20,000 vehicles that use it at peak times and can result in delays of up to 30 minutes; notes that consultation on making improvements to the roundabout has been delayed, and believes that consultation should be carried out and acted on expeditiously and should include the option of a flyover.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1228</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>VAT on Sports and Leisure Trusts&rsquo; Membership Packages</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament disapproves of HM Revenue and Customs&rsquo; (HMRC) recent decision to charge VAT on sports and leisure trusts&rsquo; membership packages and to collect unpaid VAT retrospectively over the last three years; notes that PricewaterhouseCoopers and Tax Counsel advised the Sports and Recreation Trusts Association (SpoRTA) that the way in which HMRC is seeking to charge VAT is wrong in law; recognises the potentially serious financial and social consequences for leisure trusts and their customers including higher membership fees at leisure centres necessary to cover the VAT liability which would lead to lower participation, especially in more deprived communities; is concerned that HMRC&rsquo;s decision to charge VAT retrospectively to some trusts may result in their liquidation, and further notes that HMRC&rsquo;s decision contradicts the policies of both the Scottish and Westminster governments&rsquo; efforts to promote healthier lifestyles and the wider health benefits of sport and leisure as well as undermining the drive to tackle public health issues such as obesity.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1224</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Education and Skills Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the Education and Skills Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 28 November 2007, to make provision within the legislative competence of the Parliament and to alter the executive competence of Scottish Ministers in respect of using and sharing information in relation to skills and training of people in Scotland, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
