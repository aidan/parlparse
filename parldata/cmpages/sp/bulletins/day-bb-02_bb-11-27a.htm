Robin Harper:</STRONG> As an amendment to motion S1M3560 in the name of Ross Finnie, 
The Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) (Scotland) Regulations 
2002), insert at end &quot;but, in doing so, regrets that the regulations do not 
require the consideration of &quot;ethical principles&quot; before genetically 
modified organisms (GMOs) are released or placed on the market, as highlighted 
in the preamble to Directive 2001/18/EC, and that the regulations (a) narrow the 
existing definition of &quot;harm&quot; from GMOs under the Environmental Protection 
Act 1990 instead of retaining the existing definition which includes harm to property, 
(b) weaken the existing definition in the Act of proper &quot;control&quot; of 
GMOs that currently requires any GMOs that enter the environment to be &quot;harmless&quot;, 
to only having to &quot;minimise the risk of harm&quot;, (c) allow the requirement 
for information to be contained in an application for consent to release/market 
GMOs, as required in the Directive, to be varied &quot;to the extent that such 
information is appropriate to the nature and scale of the release or application&quot; 
but do not require full information to be provided according to Annex III of the 
Directive for any release of GMOs, (d) reduce the current powers of Scottish ministers 
to &quot;revoke a consent at any time&quot; to instead only allowing a consent 
to be revoked if &quot;new information&quot; comes to light and (e) provide for 
joint powers with the Health and Safety Executive to refuse a consent on health 
grounds rather than such powers being retained solely with Scottish Ministers.&quot;.</A></P></DIR><P>2.&#9;<STRONG>Subordinate

<STRONG>Mr John Swinney:</STRONG> <STRONG>A9 - Perth to Inverness</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with concern the unacceptable level of death and injury caused 
by road traffic accidents on the A9 from Perth to Inverness; recognises that the 
design of the A9, particularly the frequent switching between single and dual 
carriageway, contributes to this level of danger; welcomes improvements made to 
the road design to improve safety, particularly measures already agreed at the 
Bankfoot and Ballinluig junctions, but recognises that, until the A9 from Perth 
to Inverness is re-constructed as a dual carriageway with safe junctions, it will 
continue to present road safety dangers to the local community and the significant 
number of visitors to the area. </P><P></P><P>&nbsp;</P></DIR><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
