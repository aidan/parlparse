            - Evaluating the Farm Scale Trials</em>; believes that the cultivation 
            of Chardon LL maize should not be considered in Scotland until a full 
            inquiry has been undertaken into the potential commercial, environmental 
            and health impact of such an introduction, and believes that, pending 
            the outcome of such an inquiry, all existing legal powers should be 
            used to block the approval of Chardon LL maize in keeping with the 
            precautionary principle. </P>

                that at present there is little support for&nbsp;commercialisation 
                of GM crops; acknowledges the European and UK legislative framework 
                for GM; recognises that the Scottish Executive is not permitted 
                by EU law to impose a blanket ban or blanket approval for GM crops; 
                understands that decisions are required on a case by case basis; 
                welcomes the Executive's decision to reject the commercial growing 
                of spring GM oil seed rape and beet; notes that the Executive 
                does not have scientific evidence nor the powers to ban the cultivation 
                of GM maize; supports the Executive's decision to seek amendment 
                to the EU approval for Chardon LL maize to restrict its cultivation; 
                supports the Executive's decision not to agree seed listing for 
                Chardon LL unless and until such EU changes are made; welcomes 
                the Executive's commitment to consult on co-existence measures 
                that will protect&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;who wish to grow conventional 
                or organic crops, give consumers the choice not to consume GM 
                foods and introduce compensation and liability measures; supports 
                the Executive's initiative with the farming industry to ensure 
                consumer confidence and consumer choice in Scottish produce, and 
                welcomes the continuing commitment in the Partnership Agreement

          <p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish National Party Debate on the Abolition 
            of Council Tax-</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1050</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Abolition 
            of Council Tax</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the council 
            tax should be abolished and replaced with a fair system of local income 
            taxation based on ability to pay; notes that the Partnership Agreement 
            published on 15 May 2003 included a commitment to establish an independent 
            review of local government finance; further notes, however, that no 
            such review has been established, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to honour its commitment by establishing the review forthwith under 
            an independent chair and reporting back to the Parliament by the end 
            of 2004. </P>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1050.4</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Abolition of Council 
            Tax</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1050) in the name of Fergus 
            Ewing, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;agrees 
            that the forthcoming independent review of local government finance 
            should be asked to conduct a thorough examination of a range of local 
            taxation systems, including the various proposals for an income-based 
            system and reforms to the present council tax system, and encourages 
            all those who wish to make a meaningful contribution to the review 
            to submit their proposals when called upon to do so.&quot; </P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1050.3</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Abolition 
            of Council Tax</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1050) in the 
            name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;the council tax&quot; to 
            end and insert &quot;local taxation cannot be viewed in isolation 
            and must be seen as part of the overall taxation system, particularly 
            as locally variable taxes only raise 18% of council revenues with 
            the rest coming from charges, business rates and central government 
            grants and further believes that the independent review of local government 
            finance must take account of what range of responsibilities is best 
            administered locally and ensure a broadly-based system of national 
            and local taxation with a combination of income, consumption, capital 
            and property taxes as the best way of delivering a fair and balanced 
            system.&quot; </P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1050.2</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard: Abolition of Council 
            Tax</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1050) in the name of Fergus 
            Ewing, leave out from &quot;income&quot; to end and insert &quot;taxation 
            based on land values; notes that the Partnership Agreement published 
            on 15 May 2003 included a commitment to establish an independent review 
            of local government finance; further notes, however, that no such 
            review has been established; calls on the Scottish Executive to honour 
            its commitment by establishing the review forthwith under an independent 
            chair and reporting back to the Parliament by the end of 2004; believes 
            that local taxation based on land values will be to the benefit of 
            Scotland's economy, society and environment, and welcomes the commitment 
            the Chancellor of the Exchequer made in presenting his budget for 
            2004 to the House of Commons to investigate the possibility of taxing 
            land values.&quot; </P>
