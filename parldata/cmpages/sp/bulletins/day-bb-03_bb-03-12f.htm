            Secondary Schools PPP Proposal</strong>-That the Parliament shares 
            the concerns of parents and pupils in East Kilbride with regard to 
            South Lanarkshire Council's public private partnership proposal for 
            secondary schools which, if implemented, will lead to 75% of resultant 
            school closures being in East Kilbride, where 50% of secondary schools 
            will be lost resulting in school rolls amongst the highest in Scotland 
            and to considerably longer school journey times for pupils owing to 
            the locations of the proposed schools; notes that the council's financial 
            proposal is underpinned by the closure of St Bride's High School, 
            academically the highest-performing school in South Lanarkshire, in 
            order that its site can be sold for development; recognises the further 
            concern of parents in East Kilbride that the consultation process 
            by South Lanarkshire Council is inadequate, and calls on the council 
            and the Minister for Finance and Public Services, in consideration 
            of the local community's deep-felt anxiety on this issue, to reconsider 
            this deeply flawed proposal.</p>

            sector, and considers certain provisions within the Bill are contrary 
            to the interests of that sector and fail to provide opportunities 
            for the next generation of farming tenants, thus failing to reinvigorate 
            the tenanted sector of agriculture in accordance with the Bill's stated
