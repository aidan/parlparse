          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1703#</strong> <STRONG>Mark Ballard:</STRONG> <STRONG>Current Account Access at Post Offices</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the agreement announced on 15 September 2004 that Clydesdale Bank customers will, from 1 October 2004, be able to withdraw and deposit cash, check their account balances and deposit cheques at any of the 1799 post office branches in Scotland; believes that this will improve access to banking facilities for geographically-remote and socially-excluded communities in Scotland, while ensuring the viability of post offices in such areas, and considers that other banks should follow the lead of Clydesdale, the Co-operative Bank, Smile, Lloyds TSB, Barclays, Alliance and Leicester plc, Cahoot and First Direct in forming an alliance with the Royal Mail to offer banking services.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1702</strong> <STRONG>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</STRONG> <STRONG>Tenements (Scotland) Bill - Business Motion</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Tenements (Scotland) Bill, debate on each part of the proceedings shall be brought to a conclusion by the time-limits indicated (each time-limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when the meeting of the Parliament is suspended or otherwise not in progress):</p>
          <p>Groups1 to 4 &ndash; no later than 30 minutes</p>
          <p>Groups 5 to 8 &ndash; no later than 45 minutes</p>
          <p>Groups 9 to 11 &ndash; no later than 1 hour and 15 minutes</p>
          <p>Groups 12 to 16 &ndash; no later than 1 hour and 30 minutes</p>
          <p>Motion to pass the Bill &ndash; 2 hours</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1701</strong> <STRONG>Christine Grahame:</STRONG> <STRONG>Borders Citizens Advice Bureau</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the excellent work of the Borders Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) where, in the last year, more than 10,400 Borderers have contacted eight local CABs with over 16,400 separate problems, representing one in 10 of the population; notes that relationship breakdowns have risen by 38%, problems with utility companies have risen by 50%, debt enquiries by 29% and housing problems by 24%; further notes that the bureaux have achieved financial gains to clients to the value of &pound;1,759,939, representing a 14.6 to 1 return on funding investment and that this money also benefits the local Borders&rsquo; economy, as well as providing a lifeline for clients, and congratulates all, from professionals to the volunteers, involved in this essential and successful work.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1697</strong> <STRONG>Carolyn Leckie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Children Deserve Justice</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that a small number of fathers may have had their access and custody claims unfairly considered but recognises that most fathers lose contact with their children within five years of divorce, even though there are no restrictions placed on contact, that most single parents are women and are placed in poverty as a result and that most incidences of restrictions of access or contact are made to protect the interests and well-being of children and women, significant numbers of whom have been subjected to domestic abuse, which can be manifested in various forms; regrets the disproportionate attention campaigns for fathers&rsquo; rights have attracted when the concerns, pressures and poverty of mothers and children have resulted in no significant action; regrets that the effect of that attention has induced a climate of misogyny, pushed the welfare of children off the agenda and shifted the political debate on families and children to the right, and believes that it is time that the interests of children are placed at the top of the agenda, starting with the removal of the massive amount of children of single parents in poverty out of poverty and offering decent, safe affordable housing for all in an environment that can offer adequate protection from abusive men as and when necessary.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1696</strong> <STRONG>Bruce Crawford:</STRONG> <STRONG>Closure of Accident and Emergency Unit in Fife</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern over the proposals by NHS Fife to move from two accident and emergency units serving Fife to only one; notes that initially accident and emergency services will be primarily based at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline, but that, in the longer term, these services will be relocated to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy; recognises that the move to only one unit is based primarily on advice from the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), but is concerned that wider risk assessment issues have not been given appropriate consideration, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that, when decisions are taken to close an accident and emergency unit, advice and direction should not simply come from the RCS but that all risk assessment factors should be taken into account and given appropriate weighting, including advice from other royal colleges, the location and distance of communities from the accident and emergency unit, the length of time it takes for more remote communities to access such a unit, the services available from GP practices and the impact on the ambulance service.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Sandra White<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Carolyn Leckie<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Christine Grahame<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1695.1</strong> <STRONG>Murdo Fraser:</STRONG> <STRONG>Growing Scotland&rsquo;s Economy - Building on Progress</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1695) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the continuing underperformance of the Scottish economy relative to the United Kingdom as a whole, despite the economic strategies of the Scottish Executive over the last five years; further notes with concern that Scotland was ranked 36th out of 60 countries in <em>IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2004</em>, some 14 places behind the United Kingdom as a whole; recognises the broad consensus of the business community in response to the Executive&rsquo;s recently published framework for economic development in Scotland, that action rather than words is required from the Executive to grow the Scottish economy, and calls upon the Executive to take immediate steps to create a more business-friendly environment by reducing business rates and water charges and cutting red tape, thereby encouraging business development and boosting Scotland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1695.2</strong> <STRONG>Jim Mather:</STRONG> <STRONG>Growing Scotland&rsquo;s Economy - Building on Progress</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1695) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;; notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;in the belief that the case has now been made and popularly acclaimed at home and internationally-proven in recent competitiveness indices for more powers for the Parliament, which are needed in order to reverse Scotland&rsquo;s historically low rate of economic growth and generate both the wealth required to provide world-class public services and infrastructure and the high quality employment opportunities needed to retain and develop fresh talent in Scotland.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1695.3</strong> <STRONG>Shiona Baird:</STRONG> <STRONG>Growing Scotland&rsquo;s Economy - Building on Progress</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1695) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges that Scotland&rsquo;s economy, society and environment are interlinked and cannot be treated in isolation; notes that prioritising economic growth, above all else, contradicts the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s stated commitment to human and environmental welfare, and that GDP growth alone is not a measure of improvement in people&rsquo;s quality of life and environmental sustainability; notes the revelation in the recent report to the Environment and Rural Development Committee by CAG Consultants, <em>Is The Scottish Executive Structured and Positioned to Deliver Sustainable Development?</em> that the most significant weakness emerged in relation to the perceived need for economic growth and the failure to acknowledge the negative environmental impacts of growth policies, and calls on the Executive to place quality of life as its number one priority, supported by the development of a sustainable economy that does not undermine social and environmental justice.&quot;</p>
