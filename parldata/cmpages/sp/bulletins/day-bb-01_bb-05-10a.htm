                        which has undermined efforts to regenerate Scottish tourism 
                        following two years of decline; calls upon the Scottish

                        Scottish businesses affected by the foot-and-mouth disease

                        date, and further calls upon the Scottish Executive to

                            of visitscotland/the Scottish Tourist Board should 
                            be sharply refocused so that it is a marketing rather 
                            than a regulatory body; notes the relief package as 
                            proposed by the Scottish Tourism Forum and calls for 
                            its full implementation, and believes that direct

                            and America are essential. </font></p>

                        the Parliament endorses the Executive’s approach to urban 
                        regeneration and the steps it has taken to enable the 
                        people in some of our most disadvantaged communities to 
                        become involved in regenerating their areas and welcomes 
                        the Executive’s intention to engage in discussions to 
                        formulate the Neighbourhood Renewal statement for Scotland.

                            citizens involved in regenerating urban Scotland; 
                            recognises that despite these efforts, levels of poverty, 
                            sickness and unemployment remain stubbornly high across 
                            much of urban Scotland, and undertakes to carry out 
                            a comprehensive review of regeneration policy in our 
                            towns and cities with specific regard to infrastructure 
                            and employment, examining the successes and failures 
                            of the past and including an analysis of thriving 
                            models of urban renewal across the United Kingdom

                        the severe problems being faced in parts of Dumfries and 
                        Galloway as a result of the current outbreak of foot and 
                        mouth disease; notes that the effects are not confined 
                        to the farming industry but also affect slaughterhouses, 
                        hauliers, food producers, tourism and retailing businesses; 
                        notes with concern that workers have already been laid 
                        off by several firms and that many more workers may imminently 
                        be laid off, and urges the Scottish Executive to work 
                        in partnership with other agencies to seek ways of ameliorating 
                        the situation as a matter of urgency. </font></p>
