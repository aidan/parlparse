          <P><strong>*S2M-795#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Council Tax Arrears</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that Scotland's council tax arrears have now topped &pound;0.5 billion, proving how inefficient local authorities are in collecting the tax; further notes with disbelief the Minister for Finance and Public Services' view that the figures are &quot;encouraging&quot;; considers that the level of arrears is the reason why some council tax payers will have to pay their council tax one month earlier, starting in April this year instead of May; believes that council tax payers, particularly senior citizens, should not be disadvantaged in this manner just because councils have failed to collect their tax timeously, which will result in council tax payments in the month of April where there were none before to come out of some pensioners' meagre budgets, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should allocate the extra &pound;48 million given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK pre-budget speech in December 2003, which was ring-fenced for council tax, to alleviate this situation.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-794</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Grove Academy Debating Success</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Grove Academy pupils Kenny Nicoll and Netan Dogra for winning the Scottish heats of the Oxford Union Schools Competition; pays tribute to the hard work of their teachers in developing their debating skills, and wishes Grove Academy success when representing Scotland at the Oxford finals during the summer.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-793#</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Public Consultation on Private Prisons</strong>-That the Parliament notes the concerns of many of its members and amongst the wider public about the proposals for private prisons in Scotland; notes that applications for two new prisons have now been lodged in Addiewell and Low Moss but that as yet the public have not been informed if either or both are intended to operate as private prisons, and expresses the view that the public should be entitled to know what kind of operation is being planned for their local communities as part of any consultation and decision-making process.</P>
