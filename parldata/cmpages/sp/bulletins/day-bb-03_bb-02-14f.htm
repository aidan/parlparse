</P><P>Supported by: Hugh Henry<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3901</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Donald Gorrie: The Future of Football in Scotland</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament urges the Scottish football authorities to appoint a group of people 
of high standing in Scotland with a genuine commitment to Scottish football that 
would promote and co-ordinate football coaching, competition and development at 
all levels, including schools, youth organisations, juvenile and youth football 
teams and adult amateur teams, in co-operation with existing organisations, and 
encourage and help professional clubs to develop youth training schemes.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3900</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Cathie Craigie: St Valentine's Day - Women and Heart Disease Campaign</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the British Heart Foundation's Valentine's Day campaign 
Take Note of Your Heart which aims to raise awareness among women about the risks 
of coronary heart disease (CHD); notes that more women die from CHD each year 
in Scotland than from all forms of cancer put together, including breast cancer; 
acknowledges that, despite this high rate, CHD is still widely considered to be 
a male disease; welcomes the approach taken by the Scottish Executive to reduce 
Scotland's high rate of heart disease through encouraging positive lifestyle choices, 
particularly as outlined in <EM>Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke: Strategy for 
Scotland</EM> and the healthyliving campaign, and encourages the Executive to 
work with the British Heart Foundation to promote awareness and prevention of 
CHD amongst women.</P><P>Supported by: Mr John McAllion<STRONG>*</STRONG>, David

<STRONG>*S1M-3899</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Closure of Glasgow City Social 
Security Office</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that those who rely 
on social security benefits are the most vulnerable in society and include elderly, 
disabled and infirm people and that these sections of the community often have 
difficulties with mobility and access to modern communications such as telephones 
and the internet; believes that social security is best delivered in properly 
staffed, local offices that are accessible to the community; is therefore dismayed 
at the plans of the Department for Work and Pensions for social security provision 
in Scotland including the closure of the Glasgow city office in 2003, which will 
mean a reduction in service and increased travel for the people in areas such 
as Glasgow city centre, Townhead, Possilpark, Hamiltonhill and Charing Cross who 
are seeking social security benefits advice and services, and the replacement 
of local overpayments sections with debt centres; is concerned at the absence 
of proper public debate and consultation on the closure of the Glasgow city office, 
and calls on the Department for Work and Pensions to keep the office open in its 
current form as a local social security office.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3898#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Dr Richard Simpson: New Forth Road Bridge Crossing Near Kincardine</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with 
the new Forth road bridge crossing upstream from the Kincardine Bridge; welcomes 
the decision by the Forth Valley NHS Board to recommend to the Executive that 
there should be a new single site acute hospital and notes the board&#146;s unanimous 
recommendation that the favoured site for the hospital should be at the Royal 
Scottish National Hospital (RSNH), Larbert; recognises the difficulties at present 
in access to the RSNH for residents in Clackmannanshire, west Fife and Stirling, 
and considers that the Executive should do all in its power to ensure that the 
bridge is completed as soon as possible and that, in considering the proposed 
site for the new hospital, the road networks should provide equity of access to 
all residents in Forth Valley.</P><P>Supported by: Cathy Peattie<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Mr Tom McCabe<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Brian Fitzpatrick<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3897#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Suicide Emergency Telephone Hotline</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">notes with concern that in 2000 there were 
880 reported suicides in Scotland, 676 males and 204 females, although the true 
figure could be higher; is conscious that many thousands of other people attempt 
to take their own lives each year; regrets that only a minority of the population 
know the telephone number of the Samaritans or any other organisation they could 
contact for help when feeling suicidal; believes that, to assist in achieving 
the goal of a 20% reduction in the incidence of suicide by 2013 set by the Scottish 
Executive in its <EM>National Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide in Scotland</EM>, 
everyone should be made aware of an all-Scotland telephone number to call for 
help; acknowledges that in the United States anyone can call a nationwide toll 
free number from anywhere in the country, 1-800-SUICIDE or 911, to ask for help 
which is provided swiftly if they say they are in &#145;suicidal danger&#146;; 
believes that the Scottish Executive should set up a suicide prevention crisis 
hotline, whereby calls from suicidal individuals are treated as an emergency, 
through using the existing 999 emergency number from which they can be referred 
directly to a dedicated suicide prevention 24-hour hotline, and further acknowledges 
that the purpose of this line would be to save lives through dissuading suicidal 
people from killing themselves and that the Executive should, once such a line 
was established, take steps to let the public know about it.</A></P><P>Supported
