<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1409</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Abducted and Missing Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that no figures for abducted and missing children in Scotland are collected by either governmental or charitable agencies; is deeply disturbed that, according to the Police National Missing Persons Bureau and Parents and Abducted Children Together (PACT), over 100,000 children go missing every year in the United Kingdom, approximately one child every five minutes; is alarmed that up to one-third of these children are under the age of 13; is distressed that child abduction offences in the UK have more than doubled in a decade; understands that the America&rsquo;s Missing Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) Alert System introduced in the USA more than 10 years ago has, according to research carried out in the field, saved the lives of more than 200 children; approves of this system whereby when a child is reported missing to the police, in a matter of minutes all the country&rsquo;s police forces are alerted, TV and radio programmes are interrupted and a picture of the missing child is flashed onto the screen, alerts appear on motorway electronic notice boards, text messages are sent out to all mobile phone subscribers and border posts and airports are notified along with Interpol, Europol and foreign police forces; understands that speed is critical in locating missing and abducted children; is disappointed that in a Europe which boasts of ever closer union, there are no European protocols, no common policies and there is no electronic infrastructure to ensure a co-ordinated European response when children are abducted or go missing, and calls on the Scottish Government to press upon the UK Government the importance of working in close partnership with other EU member states to create the necessary infrastructure to enable a rapid response from the police and public alike.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1408</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Welcome to Highland Wood Pellet Plant</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the imminent commencement of work on the &pound;25 million Balcas wood processing plant in Invergordon; welcomes the estimated 38 full-time jobs it will bring to the Easter Ross area, the extra 207 it will generate in the Highland area and the 307 in Scotland; notes that on completion it will be the largest biomass renewable energy project in the United Kingdom, producing 8 megawatts of power, over half of which will be fed into the national grid, thus displacing 170,000 tonnes of carbon per year as well as creating 100,000 wood pellets per year for renewable heat fuel, and contends that this green enterprise which uses local sustainable resources is a model for the future of sustainable businesses in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1407</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>The Draft Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that the draft Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 2008 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1406</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>The Draft Civil Legal (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that the draft Civil Legal (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 2008 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1405</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Cultural Co-ordinators</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views with alarm the decision of the Scottish Government to withdraw support from the cultural co-ordinators programme and pass responsibility to the Scottish Arts Council for a programme that is in an early stage of development but which has, with limited resources, already delivered critically important links between the worlds of art, culture and education, transforming cultural initiatives in education and enhancing children&rsquo;s educational development, and agrees that it would be better to continue to develop and extend the cultural co-ordinators initiative, rather than to discontinue a scheme that will be sorely missed in many parts of Scotland.</p>
