          <p> <strong>*S2M-106#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Scotland's 
            European Pollutant Emission Register</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the publication of the Scottish European Pollutant Emission 
            Register by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; recognises 
            that this is an important component of a strategy to deliver environmental 
            justice in Scotland; notes that all communities have a right to know 
            about chemical emissions in their environment; further notes that, 
            in the United States, the introduction of the Toxic Release Inventory 
            resulted in emission reductions of over 40%, and looks forward to 
            the rapid development and publication of a comprehensive and easily 
            accessible system that includes contextual health and environmental 
            impact information.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-105</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Future of Europe</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the continuing progress by the Convention on 
            the Future of Europe to delivering a more accountable, democratic 
            and transparent Europe committed to the peace and prosperity of its 
            citizens; extends the hand of friendship to the new incoming member 
            states; recognises the opportunities presented by European enlargement 
            for Scottish business; notes the role that European inter-regional 
            co-operation plays in expanding the cultural and linguistic horizons 
            of many of Scotland's young people; acknowledges the contribution 
            that the European Union has made to improving our environment, enhancing 
            workers rights and tackling the fight against poverty, and congratulates 
            the European Youth Parliament for the contribution that it has made 
            to the Future of Europe debate over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-104#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Dumfries and 
            Galloway Housing Partnership</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses 
            concern that Dumfries and Galloway Housing Partnership has changed 
            its allocations policy without consultation with tenants or local 
            councillors; believes that the operation of housing associations that 
            have received housing stock from councils through large-scale stock 
            transfer should be transparent; further believes, therefore, that 
            the minutes of the boards of such housing associations should be made 
            available to tenants&#146; groups and local authorities; believes 
            that local councillors should be permitted to discuss with housing 
            association officials the housing needs of their individual constituents, 
            and considers that Dumfries and Galloway Housing Partnership, as the 
            largest provider of social housing in the region, should work closely 
            with Dumfries and Galloway Council to improve housing services in 
            the area.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-103</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock: Young People</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament celebrates the contribution made to society by the 
            young people of Scotland, both at home and abroad; applauds their 
            dynamism, intellect, enthusiasm, enterprise, creativity and individuality; 
            will work in partnership with young people to help meet their aspirations; 
            believes that the establishment of the new Children&#146;s Commissioner, 
            measures to reform education by ensuring that the curriculum is built 
            around the needs of the child and that education takes place in the 
            most modern facilities, extending access to high quality sport and 
            leisure facilities and support for youth work and volunteering will 
            help young people to reach their full potential and participate in 
            society; recognises that some young people require additional support 
            and measures to do so, and commits itself whenever possible to making 
            sure that appropriate support is provided.</p>

            that when it voted to support war on Iraq it was persuaded to do so 
            by the Prime Minister&#146;s assertions of proof of the existence 
            of 200 sites of weapons of mass destruction and of his knowledge of 
            such weapons ready and available for launch within a 45-minute period; 
            further recognises that no such weapons have been discovered; notes 
            the widespread concern in the country about Government deception in 
            gathering support for war, and joins the calls being made for a full 
            independent inquiry into the Government&#146;s conduct leading up

            the official visit to the Scottish Parliament by a delegation from 
            the Palestinian Authority *now taking place in September* 2003, organised 
            by the British Council; notes that the Palestinian Authority is the 
            official legislative body of the Palestinian people; recognises that 
            the development of democracy and administrative organisation in the 
            Palestinian Authority can benefit greatly from co-operation of the 
            Scottish Parliament and hopes that this visit will represent only 
            the beginning of a positive and practical relationship with the Palestinian 
            Authority; further recognises the extremely difficult circumstances 
            in which the Palestinian Authority must operate, particularly the 
            on-going occupation by the Israeli Defence Force; aspires to a settled 
            peace in the Middle East for both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples; 
            considers that the Road Map for Peace represents an opportunity to 
            establish an independent Palestinian state within three years; insists 
            that the Road Map for Peace process must be a genuine attempt to meet 
            the aspirations of the Palestinian people, including those currently 
            with no right of return to their homeland, and calls on the Government 
            of Israel to halt the building of illegal settlements and withdraw 
            from the occupied territories immediately.</p>
