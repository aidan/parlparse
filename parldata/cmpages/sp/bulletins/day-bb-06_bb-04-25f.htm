<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4284#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Funding the Voluntary Sector</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the funding problems faced by many voluntary organisations, including groups involved in youth work, caring, and advice and support-giving services in Central Scotland, to which the general method of public funding contributes, with its over-emphasis on funding mainly innovative projects for no longer than three years; welcomes some useful funding initiatives by the Scottish Executive and local authorities, imaginative new ways of deciding on the distribution of funding set up by the Big Lottery Fund and other grant givers, some progress towards better targeted funding of community enterprises and the social economy, and full cost recovery in project funding; believes, however, that the funding system should concentrate first on providing successful voluntary organisations with continued core funding, guaranteed so long as a group fulfils its remit of public benefit, and second on providing continuing funding for proven successful projects rather than insisting that projects have to be reinvented to claim that they are innovative, and considers that the Executive, local authorities, other public and charitable grant-giving bodies and the Big Lottery Fund should co-operate in developing policies along these lines.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Smith<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4283</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Protecting Community Staff from Second-Hand Smoke</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the launch of the Royal College of Nursing&rsquo;s best practice guide for healthcare staff and managers on protecting community staff from exposure to second-hand smoke; welcomes the guidance as a valuable source of practical advice and information for community nurses and other healthcare workers who have to visit patients in their homes; believes that all healthcare workers and other workers entering people&rsquo;s homes have the right to work in a safe environment, and therefore encourages service users to take account of the needs of healthcare workers and others by enabling them to work in a smoke-free environment for the duration of their visit to offer support and assistance in the home.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4282</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Scottish Business</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the 10 Scottish businesses which recently received the Queen&rsquo;s Award for Enterprise; notes that three awards were made to firms located in Glenrothes: Velux, Ardmel and Haldane; recognises that these firms are all in the manufacturing sector; acknowledges that these and many other Scottish businesses are using their management and workforce skills to innovate and improve productivity, processes and profitability, and further recognises the role that awards like the Queen&rsquo;s Award for Enterprise play in encouraging others to follow their example and help to grow the Scottish economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4281</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Discrimination at Brigham Young University</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the value of internship programmes for MSPs, for students and for academic institutions; is concerned about a number of institutions in the United States of America, such as Brigham Young University which has been accused of undermining academic freedom and which openly discriminates against gay, lesbian and bisexual students as part of its compulsory &quot;honour code&quot;; notes that students are expelled from Brigham Young University on grounds of their sexual orientation and that some of these students have subsequently committed suicide; is committed to working for the prevention of discrimination and notes that the Scotland Act 1998 refers to discrimination on grounds of sex, marital status, race, disability, age, sexual orientation, language, social origin and other personal attributes, including beliefs or opinions, such as religious beliefs and political opinions; considers that members should not discriminate against potential interns on any of these grounds and should expect similar standards from the institutions which run internship programmes; regrets that Brigham Young University&rsquo;s &quot;honour code&quot; is not compatible with equal opportunities and human rights, and urges members to offer their internship places to institutions which have a more enlightened attitude.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4280</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Parkinson&rsquo;s Awareness Week 24 to 30 April 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 24 to 30 April 2006 is Parkinson&rsquo;s Awareness Week; further notes that the focus of this year&rsquo;s campaign, launched by the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society and entitled &quot;Get it on time&quot;, is to raise awareness of the importance of medication management in the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease; is aware that Parkinson&rsquo;s sufferers need to receive their treatment at regular times, even when in care homes or staying in hospital as a result of other conditions; recognises that when patients do not receive their treatment on time their Parkinson&rsquo;s symptoms become uncontrolled and they can become very ill, and therefore supports the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society&rsquo;s campaign to raise awareness amongst nurses, doctors, pharmacists and care staff of the importance of continuity in administering Parkinson&rsquo;s disease medication on time.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4279#</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the economic, social and environmental benefits that Aberdeen Crossrail would bring to the city and other areas of the north east; welcomes the announcement by Network Rail in April 2006 that an additional &pound;40 million is to be invested in the Scottish rail infrastructure network; considers that this additional investment should be used to help develop projects like Aberdeen Crossrail; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Transport for Tomorrow&quot; consultation as a valuable chance to debate the future of the Executive&rsquo;s transport strategy, and believes that the Executive should, through that strategy, move beyond a feasibility study of the crossrail project and progress towards a commitment to construction with a clear timetable for completion.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4278</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Payment Cuts for Miscarriage of Justice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern proposals announced by the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, to withdraw compensation payments to people who have been falsely imprisoned; believes that proposals to cut payments to people who have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice are unwelcome; supports plans to increase the monies available to people who are the victims of crime but believes it is unacceptable for this money to be taken from those who have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice by the state when it takes away the liberty of innocent people, often for many years, and calls on the Scottish Executive to announce publicly that it has no plans for Scotland to follow Westminster&rsquo;s path.</p>
