    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-983.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Summary Justice Reform</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-983) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, after second &quot;behaviour&quot; insert &quot;and recognises also that the success of a revised summary justice system will be dependent on fine payments being enforced and a much tighter and rigorous control of community service orders, and that in some cases custodial sentences are the only appropriate disposal&quot;. </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-983.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Summary Justice Reform</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-983) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, insert at end &quot;and further calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the views of professionals are taken into account in the consultation on summary justice to ensure that access to justice for the weakest and most disadvantaged in society is protected.&quot; </p>
