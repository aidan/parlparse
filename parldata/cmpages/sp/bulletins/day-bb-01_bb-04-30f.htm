            notes with dismay the closure of the Jaeger clothing factory in Campbeltown 
            with the loss of up to 161 jobs; recognises that this is a devastating 
            blow for the Kintyre economy, already suffering from an unemployment 
            rate well above the national average and designated a priority area 
            by Argyll and the Islands Enterprise; further notes that this closure 
            comes on top of the closure of the Campbeltown shipyard in 1996, the 
            pullout by the RAF in 1997 and the temporary suspension of the Ballycastle

            that the Scottish Executive should provide backing and support to 
            allow local agencies to develop a rescue package for the area which 
            recognises that the loss of the town’s largest employer is a further,

            with a mental health illness and believes that the Scottish Executive

            previously submitted for around £2.4 million of capital grant from

            has been submitted and has been said by the First Minister to be at

            notes with concern that, while Scotland is the multiple sclerosis 
            (MS) capital of the world with 10,400 people with MS, only 2.4% of 
            these people have access to beta interferon compared with equivalent 
            percentages of 15% in Finland and 13% in Italy; notes that the cost 
            of providing beta interferon to those in Scotland who might benefit 
            would be some £7 million, representing a minute fraction of the NHS 
            budget; queries the cost of beta interferon in Scotland as compared 
            to elsewhere; notes the inadequate provision of physiotherapy for 
            those affected by MS; further notes the lack of provision of specialist 
            MS nurses; affirms that MS nurses should be fully funded by the NHS; 
            notes that there is an urgent need for suitable respite facilities; 
            recommends that it be standard practice on a diagnosis of MS that 
            the appropriate consultant meet the patient’s GP to inform them and 
            discuss the case, as many GPs may only occasionally see a case of 
            MS and may therefore be uninformed about the disease and treatments; 
            considers that money expended on the above will not only benefit the 
            10,400 people with MS and their carers but would also lead to a net

            Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for failing to provide 
            relief for outraged local residents from the appalling smells and 
            for being unable to guarantee that the groundwater, which is close 
            to the River Clyde, was not being affected by the dump, which is licensed 
            to take arsenic, cyanide, asbestos and a total of 27 poisonous chemicals;

            for Greater Glasgow stated &quot;smells are, at times, literally breathtaking&quot;, 
            believes that, despite other attempts over the years, the continued

            of the dump, which is licensed to take up to 500,000 tonnes of waste 
            every year including sewage which is hauled through urban areas on 
            around 4,000 lorries; is deeply concerned that Paterson’s is the only 
            high level toxic dump still existing within a city boundary in Scotland 
            and that, after enduring the dump for 44 years, local people deserve

            no longer have access to a grass playing field and that, despite government 
            promises to promote sport, there is evidence of a serious long-term 
            decline in the facilities available, almost 40% of schools do not 
            have a football pitch and there is real concern also about community 
            facilities which are closing down because of a lack of resources to 
            maintain them; considers that this situation means that the already 
            high obesity rate among young Scots will continue to rise in the future 
            and that the nation’s performance in the world sporting arena will 
            go into irreversible decline, and therefore calls upon the Scottish

            and young people and ensure that locally available and appropriate

            won, among other top level successes, a Commonwealth Gold Medal for 
            Scotland in 1998; notes that the decision to transfer to England is 
            being considered with regret, and would result from Scotland’s lack
