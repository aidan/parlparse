<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1662</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Welcome Return of Direct Flights Between Scotland and Pakistan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the resumption of twice weekly direct flights between Scotland and Pakistan; notes that the service will be incredibly valuable to thousands of Scots and Pakistanis who often travel between the two countries; congratulates Pakistan International Airlines and Glasgow Airport for working together to bring back this important service to Glasgow; believes that the resumption of flights is an indicator of the stabilising situation in Pakistan, and hopes that this exchange will enhance local businesses and economies in both countries.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1661</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Zimbabwe Vigil in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its support to the organisers of a regular vigil in Glasgow to protest against human rights abuses in Zimbabwe; regrets the continuing food shortages, monetary crisis and political instability in Zimbabwe, ahead of national elections on 29 March 2008, and believes that people across Scotland should show support for the vigil as a means of showing solidarity with people in Zimbabwe and expressing desire for a peaceful and democratic end to the crisis.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1660&diams; </strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Alternative and Augmentative Communication</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern following the findings by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, Capability Scotland and Augmentative Communication in Practice whose recent survey of alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) equipment and speech and language therapy support provision in Scotland revealed that eight out of 15 NHS boards, including NHS Grampian, are providing a poor service; notes that only 16% of potential beneficiaries are accessing specialist AAC services in Scotland and that AAC provision is a postcode, age, advocacy and impairment lottery, and considers that an AAC strategy for Scotland should be developed and implemented to provide for a national standard of specialist speech and language therapy provision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1659</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Look OK...Feel Crap?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Look OK&hellip;Feel Crap? campaign piloted across the Lothians in order to reverse the suicide rate among young adults in that region; recognises that the campaign&rsquo;s website www.lookokfeelcrap.org has helped thousands of young people to deal with depression which is often an underground and life-threatening illness by giving ongoing support and information provision, and believes that the 47% increase in inquiries from clients and carers is an illustration that this campaign is saving lives.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1658</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Forensic Science Laboratory in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice is currently considering plans to close the forensic science laboratory in Aberdeen; recognises the vital role that forensic scientists and fingerprint staff play in working with police officers in Grampian in tackling crime; notes in particular that forensic scientists working exclusively on volume crime in partnership with officers in Grampian are increasing detection rates on offences such as housebreaking, car crime and vandalism; believes that such progress would be jeopardised by the proposed closure of the Aberdeen forensic science laboratory, and calls on Scottish Ministers to consult the public in Grampian and the Highlands and Islands on the future of the service before reaching any decision to close the Aberdeen forensic science laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1657</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>European Maritime Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of an annual European Maritime Day to be instituted on 20 May 2008 to celebrate Europe&rsquo;s maritime heritage and marine-related issues; further recognises the vital role that the marine environment plays in the past, present and future of Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to help mark the day with events to highlights its importance.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1656</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to East Ayrshire Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates East Ayrshire Council for its achievements in the Scottish Awards for Quality in Planning for 2007, including achieving the overall winner&rsquo;s place for the <em>Kilmarnock Conservation Area Maintenance Guide</em>, described as an innovative regeneration and conservation project.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1647</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Scottish Labour MPs Fail to Represent Constituents&rsquo; Concerns</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the actions of Scottish Labour MPs in voting against an inquiry into the war on Iraq by an independent committee, particularly Glasgow MPs John Robertson, Ann McKechin and Mohammad Sarwar who despite voting against the Iraq war in 2003, voted on 25 March 2008 against holding an independent inquiry into the UK Government&rsquo;s conduct in the run up to and during the war itself; believes that these MPs&rsquo; views do not represent the views of the Scottish people and therefore could be seen to constitute a dereliction of their duties in representing the interests of their constituents, and further believes this to be another example of disingenuous representation of their views by Glasgow Labour MPs, given their public declarations against the post office closures while voting with the UK Government to close post offices and their subsequent failure to vote to stop the closures.</p>
