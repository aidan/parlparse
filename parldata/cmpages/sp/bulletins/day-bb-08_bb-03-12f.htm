<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1550</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Fuel Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the fact that while household fuel prices have risen by six times the rate of inflation over the past year, power companies&rsquo; profits have risen by 500%; is concerned that, for every 5% increase in fuel prices, it is estimated that 40,000 more Scottish households become fuel poor, while almost 3,000 deaths per year are linked to living in cold, damp housing; believes that tackling the social, health and environmental impacts of fuel poverty can save people money, improve health to help tackle climate change; calls for the re-establishment of the Fuel Poverty Forum with a remit to include the development of a one-stop-shop approach to fuel poverty that increases the installation of energy efficiency measures, efficient central heating systems, microgeneration and smart meter technology; calls on the Scottish Government to consider the introduction of a local tax rebate to provide a further incentive to householders to invest in energy efficiency and microgeneration packages, and further calls for changes to planning rules to make it easier to install micropower.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1549</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament reaffirms its commitment to reinstating the Borders railway and condemns the SNP government for cancelling government funding for the construction of the line and failing to commit to a start date for its construction; deplores the uncertainty that this has caused about the future of the project, and calls on the Scottish Government to commit direct funding for the capital costs of the Borders railway and to take forward the construction of the project without delay.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1548</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> <strong>National Parks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the forthcoming strategic review of Scotland&rsquo;s two national parks; welcomes the opportunities that the national parks give to Scotland&rsquo;s citizens and visitors, and in particular commends their contribution to the greener Scotland agenda.</p>
<p>Supported by: Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1547</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Iranian Asylum Seekers Mehdi Kazemi and Pegah Emambakhsh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the UK Home Office decision to reject asylum applications from Mehdi Kazemi and Pegah Emambakhsh, both Iranian nationals who fear persecution and execution on return to Tehran on the basis of their sexual orientation; notes with deep concern reports that Mehdi Kazemi&rsquo;s former boyfriend was arrested and executed for sodomy and that Ms Embambakhsh&rsquo;s partner was arrested and may face being stoned to death; expresses concern over increasing reports of growing repression in Iran and figures from Iranian human rights campaigners which state that over 4,000 lesbians and gay men have been executed since 1979, and calls on the UK Government to urgently review these cases and the guidance issued to immigration officers and to consider following the example of the Netherlands and Germany by imposing a moratorium on the deportation of gay and lesbian asylum seekers who fear that they will be persecuted in Iran.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1545</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Northfield Academy&rsquo;s Respect and Leadership Conference</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Northfield Academy on its Respect and Leadership Conference, held at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre, which its pupils were responsible for organising; notes that the event brought together representatives of business, pupil councils and the Chief Executive of sportscotland to address the conference; recognises the success of the event in bringing pupils into contact with a number of important local organisations and enabling them to hear keynote speeches from leaders in their field, and congratulates pupils for their hard work and initiative in organising such a successful event.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1544</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Citizenship Oaths</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern proposals to introduce citizenship ceremonies involving an oath of allegiance to Britain and the Crown for school leavers in the United Kingdom; believes that such a scheme would be unnecessary and unpopular in Scotland, and further believes that such a scheme could undermine the tradition in Scotland that sovereignty is vested in the people rather than any one individual or institution.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1539#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Leven to Thornton Rail Link</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the South-East Scotland Transport Partnership commissioned a feasibility study into the reopening of the Leven to Thornton rail link; believes that the reopening of this line to passengers and freight is vital to the regeneration of the Levenmouth area; notes that the reopening of the Leven to Thornton rail link is one of Fife Council&rsquo;s top transport priorities, and believes that those most interested in the regeneration of Levenmouth should contribute to the feasibility study now being carried out.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1538</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Delivery of RA Services in Scotland: The View of Healthcare Professionals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent report for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Scotland by the Scottish Inflammatory Diseases and Rheumatology Industry Group which shows that approximately 152,000 to 217,000 people in Scotland suffer either from rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis; recognises the importance of early diagnosis which impacts on the long-term outcome for the patient; notes that regular auditing is needed in order to maintain an understanding of effective and non-effective patient treatment; recommends that the Scottish Government considers strategies to facilitate and improve the exchange of knowledge within hospitals in order to continue to improve RA patient care, and commends healthcare professionals for their hard work and dedication.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1537</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>European Alcohol and Health Forum&rsquo;s Social Norms Forum 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent establishment of the European Alcohol and Health Forum and its announcement of a European social norms forum to be held in 2009; notes that this will be the first conference on social norms to be held in Europe; congratulates researchers John McMahon and John McAlaney on their invitations to speak at this event following their promising work in this field at the University of Paisley and elsewhere in the United Kingdom; further notes that the social norms approach is an evidence-based, data-driven and cost-effective method of achieving large-scale positive results in reducing high-risk drinking as well as other risky behaviours, and, accordingly, calls on the Scottish and UK governments to increase their engagement with and support for the social norms approach to public health and wellbeing issues.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1536</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>World Kidney Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes World Kidney Day on 13 March 2008; applauds the work of Kidney Research UK; commends the excellent work being done across Scotland in both kidney transplants and dialysis; calls on ministers to fully implement the recommendations of the Organ Donation Task Force&rsquo;s report as soon as possible, and encourages members of the public to sign up to the NHS Organ Donor Register at www.uktransplant.org.uk.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1520</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Cuba</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent decision by Fidel Castro not to seek re-election to the National Assembly of Cuba and wishes him all the best in his future role; sees this as another opportunity to embrace the ideas of positive engagement between the people of Scotland and Cuba; notes that Fidel remains an inspiration to the majority of Cuban people and to all those seeking to challenge injustice and inequality around the world; commends his heroic contribution to the fight against poverty and oppression; congratulates Cuba on an unrivalled legacy of internationalism and humanitarian aid throughout the developing world with one million poor patients treated with eye surgery under Operation Miracle; notes that Cuba is the only country with permanent emergency medical corps on standby to respond to natural emergencies and, further, has 30,000 free medical scholarships for doctors from developing countries, with plans for a further 200,000 in the next ten years; believes that Cuba&rsquo;s sovereign institutions should be respected by the US Government; calls for an end to the illegal blockade of Cuba, and congratulates Raul Castro on his appointment as head of state and wishes him every success for the future of a socialist Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1520.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Cuba</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1520) in the name of Elaine Smith, leave out from first &quot;and wishes him&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that, according to Human Rights Watch, Castro repressed nearly all forms of political dissent, enforced political conformity using criminal prosecutions, long and short-term detentions, mob harassment, police warnings, surveillance, house arrests, travel restrictions and politically-motivated dismissals from employment and that the end result is that Cubans are systematically denied basic rights to free expression, association, assembly, privacy, movement and due process of law; further notes that the Cuban Government forbids Cubans from leaving or returning to Cuba without first obtaining official permission and that it frequently bars citizens from taking their children with them overseas, essentially holding the children hostage to guarantee the parents&rsquo; return; recalls with sadness the events of 1994 when a tugboat packed with Cubans fleeing their homeland was intercepted by Cuban Navy patrol boats, resulting in the deaths of 41 men, women and children after being swept off the tug&rsquo;s deck with high-pressure water hoses; further recalls with sadness the events of 2003 when the Cuban Government arrested dozens of journalists, librarians and human rights activists who were given very lengthy prison sentences following closed-door trials branded as hasty and manifestly unfair by Amnesty International; notes that in July 2005 the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, a respected local human rights group, issued a list of 306 prisoners who it said were incarcerated for political reasons, and therefore, in light of Mr Castro&rsquo;s appalling record of political repression, warmly welcomes his retirement from public office and looks forward to the day when the Cuban people can throw off the shackles of Marxist oppression and enjoy life in the free world.&quot;</p>
