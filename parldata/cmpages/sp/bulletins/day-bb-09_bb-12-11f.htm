<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the<a href="#end"> end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5398</strong> <strong>James Kelly:</strong> <strong>People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the continued work of the People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery in its support for charitable causes in Scotland; notes the news that some of the residents in the G73 1 postcode sector in Rutherglen will share in a &pound;2 million payout, which will be an early Christmas present to all concerned, and wishes the lottery every success as it continues to raise money for good causes in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5397</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Inverclyde Council Provide Information in Sign Language</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that Inverclyde Council is one of the first local authorities to make sign language available on its website; notes that the council has been in discussions with the local deaf community and Inverclyde Council on Disability (ICOD) on how to implement this initiative on their website; further notes that the interpretations have been produced by a local deaf youth group, Open Doors Media Project, the members of which have completed their media skills training at James Watt College; acknowledges the forward thinking actions of Inverclyde Council to have sign language available on its website, and congratulates all those involved in making this possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5396</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Rethink Afghanistan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent screening at Edinburgh&rsquo;s Filmhouse of campaigning filmmaker Robert Greenwald&rsquo;s acclaimed real-time documentary, <em>Rethink Afghanistan</em>, which is also available to watch for free online at www.rethinkafghanistan.com; further notes that the film&rsquo;s makers have interviewed Afghan MPs, women&rsquo;s groups, peace campaigners, members of the armed forces and others on the ground in Afghanistan with the aim of informing and redirecting political thinking about the purpose and objectives of the intervention in Afghanistan; further notes that the war in Afghanistan has now lasted for over eight years and has claimed the lives of over 230 UK troops and an estimated 7,000 Afghan civilians, and calls on the UK Government to rethink the United Kingdom&rsquo;s role in Afghanistan, the objectives of the intervention and the timescale within which the government believes that these goals will be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5395</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Oesophageal Cancer in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of research by Ochre, the national oesophageal cancer charity, into the condition in Scotland; expresses its concern that Scotland has much higher rates of oesophageal cancer than other parts of the United Kingdom; considers that early diagnosis is critical to successful treatment and that GP and public awareness of the condition needs to be improved so that early symptoms can be correctly identified; notes that, according to Ochre&rsquo;s research, there is often confusion regarding cancer of the throat and oesophageal cancer and that they are separate conditions; notes that the World Health Organization has warned that oesophageal cancer is predicted to rise by 64.3% by 2020, and urges the Scottish Government to ensure better access to endoscopy services at primary health care locations in order to speed up diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5394</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Rail Fares for Companions of Deafblind People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, although deafblind rail passengers receive free rail travel across Scotland, people accompanying them have to pay a full fare; considers that people with a dual sensory impairment are extremely unlikely to travel unaccompanied and therefore need a companion; notes that there are currently concessionary fares available for people aged over 55 and considers that, at the very least, this could be extended to include companions of dual sensory impaired travellers, and calls on all train companies across Scotland to review their policies toward people accompanying deafblind travellers and consider introducing free travel for their companions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5393</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>From Black Mountain to Blue Water Exhibition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the <em>From Black Mountain to Blue Water</em> exhibition, which features artwork by North Lanarkshire senior pupils produced during the annual Kilbowie Art and Design Summer School 2009; notes that the exhibition will run until 10 January 2010 at Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Life in Coatbridge; further notes that the exhibition contains over 40 works in oils, pastels, mixed media, textiles and musical composition; supports the aims of the summer school, which offers both a residential working environment and an inspirational opportunity for senior pupils studying art and design and music at what is a crucial stage in their artistic life and development; congratulates the students on the high quality of their work; wishes them every success in developing their creative talents, and commends North Lanarkshire Council on its commitment to providing such a valuable and often life-changing experience for young artists in the region.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5392</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Music for a Christmas Evening</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the local theatrical and musical groups in West Dunbartonshire together with the council staff responsible for the <em>Music for a Christmas Evening</em> series of concerts that have been running for more than 20 years to raise money for local music groups and notes that this year&rsquo;s concerts, which included a Homecoming theme at the suggestion of West Dunbartonshire Council, were both enjoyable, and were attended by over 1,300 people and that over &pound;1,100 was collected on the three nights of performances for Macmillan Nurses, St Margaret of Scotland Hospice and Robin House, the children&rsquo;s hospice in Balloch.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5391</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Role in National Research into Asbestos-related Diseases</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the <em>National Centre for Asbestos-Related Diseases (NCARD): A Strategy Document</em> on 30 November 2009 by the NCARD Development Group; considers that this important document is significant for the future of research into asbestos-related illnesses and the treatment of such conditions; believes that Scottish involvement in the development of asbestos research in the United Kingdom would be beneficial; notes with deep concern that, according to the Health and Safety Executive, exposure to asbestos is the biggest single cause of work-related deaths and that the number of people dying of an asbestos-related disease is rising and is yet to peak; further notes that NHS Fife has reported that 239 people from Fife have been diagnosed with asbestos-related illnesses in the last five years<font color="#0000ff">; </font>is reminded that asbestos-related disease is by no means a problem of the past; recognises the important work of support organisations across Scotland, and sends a message to victims and their families in Scotland that MSPs will continue to work to improve awareness, research and treatment of asbestos-related diseases.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5390</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Security Industry Authority</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the progress made by the Security Industry Authority (SIA) in regulating the private security industry; notes that many reputable security firms deliver high standards of professionalism and service; believes that the SIA approved contractor scheme makes a valuable contribution in setting quality standards; supports the steps taken to ensure that Scottish Government contracts are awarded only to companies that are members of the approved contractor scheme, and calls on all public agencies and councils to introduce a similar rule for any contracts awarded to private security operators.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5389#</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Save Our Car Park Campaign, Kirkcaldy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Save Our Car Park campaign in Kirkcaldy in which High Street retailers, members of the public, politicians and <em>The Fife Free Press</em> have rejected a proposal by Fife Council to build a local swimming pool on the busiest public car park serving Kirkcaldy High Street; considers that space restrictions on the site mean that the pool could not be extended to include fit-for-purpose dry sports facilities when funding became available; also considers that having the pool in this location will take away key car parking facilities for the town centre and will be detrimental to the work that has been done by retailers on the High Street to boost the local economy; further considers the overwhelming opposition to Fife Council&rsquo;s decision, with campaigners collecting over 2,000 signatures in support; recognises that those opposing the choice of location include large and small town centre traders, shoppers, car park users, Kirkcaldy Area Sports Council, sports clubs, pool users and individuals throughout Kirkcaldy, and believes the scope of the consultation conducted by Fife Council to have been inadequate, as demonstrated through widespread public opposition to the decision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5387</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Viva la Revolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Cuba on the 50th anniversary of the Cuban revolution; notes the United Nations <em>Human Development Report 2009</em>, which acknowledges that Cuba, despite the ongoing economic blockade by the United States and limited resources, has achieved health and education standards that are as good as, if not better than, most developed countries in the world, with a 99.8% literacy rate and a 78.5-year life expectancy, and would welcome increased cooperation and cultural exchange between Scotland and Cuba for the benefit of both countries.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5387.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Viva la Revolution</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5387) in the name of Sandra White, leave out from first &quot;Cuba&quot; to end and insert &quot;Human Rights Watch on the publication of its report, <em>New Castro, Same Cuba,</em> exposing ongoing abuses of human rights under the leadership of Ra&uacute;l Castro; notes from the report that the Ra&uacute;l Castro government has relied on the criminal code offence of dangerousness, which allows authorities to imprison individuals before they have committed any crime, on the suspicion that they are likely to commit an offence in the future and that this dangerousness provision is defined as behaviour that contradicts Cuba&rsquo;s socialist norms; notes the reported case of Ram&oacute;n Vel&aacute;squez Toranzo who set out on a peaceful march across Cuba to call for respect for human rights and freedom for all political prisoners and was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison for dangerousness in January 2007; further notes the reported case of Raymundo Perdig&oacute;n Brito, a journalist who wrote articles documenting abuses by the government and published them on foreign websites, who was sentenced to four years in prison for dangerousness in December 2006 and has endured repeated beatings by guards and solitary confinement during his incarceration; also notes the comments of Jos&eacute; Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, that &quot;In his three years in power, Ra&uacute;l Castro has been just as brutal as his brother&quot; and that &quot;Cubans who dare to criticize the government live in perpetual fear, knowing they could wind up in prison for merely expressing their views&quot;, and therefore considers that MSPs should desist from legitimising the Cuban regime by heaping praise upon Cuba.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5309#</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Usdaw Freedom from Fear Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is shocked and horrified that there has been a 78% increase in violence and abuse against Scottish shopworkers over the last three years, according to Retailers Against Crime; believes that further measures need to be taken to deter violence against shopworkers and other workers delivering a service to the public; welcomes the Freedom from Fear campaign organised by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), which seeks to make shops and shopping areas safer for staff and customers; recognises that the sale of age-restricted products, especially alcohol, is a frequent flashpoint for verbal abuse, threats and violence against shopworkers; further recognises the difficulties that shopworkers, *including in Paisley South*, have policing age-restricted sales and how that can leave them vulnerable, isolated and under threat of prosecution when mistakes are made; *considers that there would be benefit in* high-profile campaigns that support the Think 25 policy and highlight to youngsters that it is an offence to attempt to buy alcohol under age, and *would welcome a partnership approach to the development of* strategies to prevent under-age sales *rather than* sting operations, which seek to prosecute shopworkers.</p>
