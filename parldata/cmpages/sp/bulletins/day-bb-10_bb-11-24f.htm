<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7477 John Swinney: Scottish Variable Rate of Income Tax</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish variable rate (SVR) remains a power in statute; further notes the substantial investment required to make the SVR operate in a way compatible with HM Revenue and Custom&rsquo;s IT system; believes that such expenditure requires careful consideration at a time of huge public spending pressures; further believes that this expenditure requires to be assessed in the context that the SVR is due to be replaced by a new taxation system; calls on the UK Government to specify the costs of its Calman taxation proposals so that the Scottish Parliament can judge whether these costs should be met and that the Scottish Parliament should be informed of these costs before considering whether to give approval to the proposed UK legislation, and records the fact that such costs, under HM Treasury&rsquo;s own statement of funding policy, should be borne by the UK Government, all of which demonstrates the need for the Scottish Parliament to have full financial responsibility.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7475 Ian McKee: BAA Domestic Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at BAA&rsquo;s proposals to increase domestic departure charges at London Heathrow from April 2011, which would see the charge rise from &pound;13.43 to &pound;20.25, an increase of over 50%; notes that the move would bring the charges in line with those for international passengers; considers that this is completely unjustifiable given that domestic passengers do not use the same facilities asinternational passengers, such as customs and immigration channels; believes that the charges would discriminate against Scottish travellers, including local businesses and leisure travellers, and would damage Scotland&rsquo;s economy, which in its view depends on air connectivity to and from Heathrow; further believes that, in the absence of a high speed rail network connecting London to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland must rely on good value domestic air links, and calls on BAA to reconsider its proposal.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7474 Johann Lamont: A Budget for Scotland&rsquo;s People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Government has been presented with its spending budgets for the four-year spending review period yet has chosen to provide local authorities, NHS boards, universities, colleges, the voluntary sector and the wider public sector with only one-year budget proposals for 2011-12; believes that such uncertainty is corrosive as it does not allow those organisations to plan effectively; believes that this inability to plan will have an adverse impact on services, individuals, families and communities, and calls on the Scottish Government to follow the example of the Welsh Assembly Government and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and publish indicative figures until at least 2013-14, in addition to its planned one-year budget for 2011-12.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7473 Dr Richard Simpson: Ban on Caffeinated Alcohol</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the United States Food and Drug Administration has banned pre-mixed caffeinated alcohol drinks; notes that this moves beyond the recent voluntary withdrawal of these by a number of major suppliers and the banning of such drinks in at least four states, and believes that it is now in the interests of public safety that pre-mixed caffeinated alcoholic drinks be withdrawn from sale in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7472 Bill Wilson: Irish Prohibition of Depleted Uranium Weapons Bill 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the chair of the Irish Green Party, Dan Boyle, on his Private Member&rsquo;s Prohibition of Depleted Uranium Weapons Bill 2009 clearing its fifth parliamentary stage, and in doing so, winning praise from senators from across the Irish political spectrum and an endorsement from Dick Roche, the Minister of State at the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, and expresses the hope that it will swiftly complete its successful passage through the D&aacute;il; calls on the UK Government to enact similar legislation and to properly investigate the effects of depleted uranium on people and to immediately release what information it holds regarding the deployment of weapons containing depleted uranium; considers that this latter information is important in investigating the potential links between depleted uranium and cancers, birth deformities and stillbirths, and believes, with reference to motion S3M-7332 by Bill Wilson, <em>UN Vote on Depleted Uranium</em>, that reluctance to release such data can only lend weight to speculation that the governments of the UK, the USA, France and Israel are attempting to cover up the impact of depleted uranium on health.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7471 David Whitton: Support for ED&rsquo;s Cycle Co-op</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the success of ED&rsquo;s Cycle Co-op for what it considers its outstanding impact as revealed in the recent Sustrans Hands-Up Scotland survey; understands that almost 8% of pupils now cycle to primary schools across seven primaries in Bishopbriggs, almost three times the national average in 2009; considers that, because of the scheme, the rate at St Matthew&rsquo;s Primary School, at almost 20%, is double the Scottish Government target of 10% by 2020, 10 years ahead of schedule; notes that ED&rsquo;s Cycle Co-op has organised events such as the inaugural Bishopbriggs Cycle Festival, which had around 1,000 participants, and the Guinness World Record attempt at simultaneous bike-bell ringing to the tune of the Blue Danube, which was broadcast to over 2.9 million listeners on Classic FM and shown on STV Daybreak; notes a four-fold expansion of the St Matthew&rsquo;s Primary School cycle club, from 32 to 128 participants, who receive cycle skills, cycle mechanics, first aid and escorted rides looking at the natural and cultural heritage around East Dunbartonshire, and nearly a 5%  modal shift in cycling to primary schools in just one year, and considers that there would be an economic benefit of between &pound;2 and 4 billion every year if Scotland could achieve European levels of cycling.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7467 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Number of Inner House Judges (Variation) Order 2010 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7464 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the timetable for Stage 1 consideration of the End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill be extended to 3 December 2010.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7463 Peter Peacock: Moray Firth&rsquo;s Spectacular Coastline</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Moray Firth coastline has been ranked among the most beautiful and spectacular in the world by the <em>National Geographic Traveller</em> magazine&rsquo;s panel of experts in sustainable tourism; considers that its scenery, beaches, marine wildlife and coastal communities deserve to be better known and visited, and urges the Scottish Executive to support the statutory and voluntary agencies that are working to promote sustainable tourism in the Moray Firth.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7462 Marilyn Livingstone: Congratulations to John Robertson</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates John Robertson, the managing director of Burntisland Fabrications Ltd (BiFab), on winning the Business Leader of the Year Award at the Fife Business Awards; considers that John Robertson and BiFab have made a significant contribution to the growth of Fife&rsquo;s economy, and welcomes the fact that the Fife Economy Partnership, which sponsored the awards, has identified renewables as a key growth sector for Fife and that one of the aims of its strategy is for Fife to become a centre of excellence for the renewables industry.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7461&diams;
  Elaine Murray: Keep the Post Public</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign organised by the Keep The Post Public Coalition opposing the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail; believes that the UK Government&rsquo;s plans threaten the continuation of the universal service obligation and will lead to reduced services and discriminatory charges in rural areas; believes that privatisation will also result in the closure of post offices throughout Scotland; congratulates the Communications Workers Union for proposing an alternative business model, which it considers would allow the Royal Mail to remain in the public sector; notes the widespread public opposition to the privatisation of the Royal Mail including that of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat-led Dumfries and Galloway Council, which voted to keep the post public at its meeting of 18 November 2010, and would welcome further votes against these plans across Scotland.</p>
