            Sheridan: Rail Disasters</strong>—That the Parliament believes that, in 
            the light of the recent rail disaster at Hatfield and the many others 
            in recent years since privatisation of the industry, it is necessary 
            to return the national rail network to public ownership and control 
            in order to ensure that passenger safety is put before financial considerations, 
            to restore public confidence and to resolve the fragmentation of the 
            rail industry which is rendering attempts to address safety issues 
            unnecessarily complicated.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1266#</strong> <strong>Andrew 
            Wilson: OKI, Cumbernauld</strong>—That the Parliament notes with regret 
            the recent job losses at the OKI electronic equipment plant in Cumbernauld 
            which were a direct result of the high value of the pound and the 
            failure of the UK to join the European Single Currency; congratulates 
            the workforce of OKI on their excellent record of productivity and 
            efficiency, and calls for all possible action to be taken by the UK 
            Government to bring down the damagingly high rate of the pound and 
            end the continuing harm that Scotland’s non-membership of the Euro 
            is doing to Scottish jobs particularly in Scotland’s trading sector.</font></p>

            Adam Ingram: School Milk</strong>—That the Parliament notes with concern 
            that almost one third of children go to school without breakfast; 
            recognises the importance of the provision of subsidised school milk 
            in providing children with essential calories, vitamins, proteins 
            and minerals; welcomes the decision by the EU to fund school milk 
            at 75% of the target milk price; supports provision of the necessary 
            top-up funding of an estimated £380,000 in Scotland to ensure the 
            maintenance of the current level of subsidy for school milk in primary

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>S1M-1264</strong> <strong>Mr 
            Kenneth Gibson: Scotland's Participation in Future Olympic Games</strong>—That 
            the Parliament congratulates all British participants in the recent 
            Sydney Olympic Games; is pleased that the number of gold medals won 
            by the Great Britain team was the highest for 80 years; is aware that 
            Cuba won the same number of gold medals as Britain, as did Romania, 
            while the Netherlands won 12, despite these countries having less 
            than a fifth, a third and a quarter of Great Britain’s population; 
            realises that Great Britain came only thirtieth in terms of per capita 
            success; believes that this is due to continued underfunding of sport 
            relative to other countries, resulting for example in Britain having 
            only eight Olympic sized swimming pools compared with 1,500 in Australia, 
            which has a population only a third of the size of Britain’s; notes 
            that the 199 countries participating excluded one of Europe’s oldest 
            nations, Scotland; notes that while most national Olympic Committees 
            are from nations, the International Olympic Committee also recognises 
            independent territories, commonwealths, protectorates and geographical 
            areas and that therefore, despite the Minister for Children and Education’s 
            statement on 28 September 2000 (<i>Official Report,</i> col. 792-3), 
            there is not necessarily only a single recognised Olympic committee 
            for each independent nation state; is pleased that American Samoa, 
            Aruba, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, 
            Guam, Hong Kong, Netherlands Antilles, Palestine, Puerto Rico and 
            US Virgin Islands all entered teams in the Olympics despite their 
            non-independent status; recognises that Scotland competes in the cricket, 
            football and rugby union world cups and Commonwealth Games in its 
            own right; believes that Scotland should compete in the Athens and 
            subsequent Olympic Games in its own right, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to work to that end.</font></p>

            Lyon: Caledonian MacBrayne</strong>—That the Parliament recognises the 
            high proportion of Caledonian MacBrayne employees who are drawn from 
            the communities that the company serves; acknowledges the importance 
            of these jobs to the economic well-being of these remote and island 
            communities; notes with concern the fears that employees of Caledonian 
            MacBrayne have regarding the potential consequences of the competitive 
            tendering process required by the European Commission, and urges the 
            Scottish Executive to do everything within its power to ensure that

            and after the conclusion of that process.</font></p>

            Sundays in parts of the City and calls upon Aberdeen City Council

            autism and other disorders in children and calls upon the Scottish

            for those parents who request it for a five year period while further

            for Education and Employment to introduce Dance and Drama Awards for 
            students to study at institutions in England and Wales; is aware that 
            Scottish students compete on equal terms for places at such institutions 
            with their counterparts from other parts of the United Kingdom and 
            the European Union (EU); is concerned that tuition fees are only paid 
            if students study in England and Wales and regrets that no parallel 
            funding scheme exists for students who wish to study in Scotland; 
            believes that this discrimination against Scottish institutions can 
            only harm them and in the case of Ballet West may force it out of 
            business or to relocate from Taynuilt to outwith Scotland, to the 
            detriment of the local economy and employment; notes that Ballet West 
            attracts students from across the United Kingdom, the EU and as far 
            afield as Guatemala, Japan and Malaysia and outperforms competitor 
            schools from south of the border in ballet competitions and quality 
            of training; is puzzled by the Minister for Children and Education’s 
            view that &quot;there is no evidence of significant demand for Dance 
            and Drama training for young people aged 16 and over in Scotland&quot; 
            when 613 applications were received by Ballet West for 23 places; 
            regrets that 34 students withdrew or rejected offers from Ballet West 
            due to lack of funding, compared with only two students doing so at 
            English institutions; notes that the Excellence Fund supports and 
            encourages talent secondary school dancers in Scotland but that the 
            only progression into tertiary training encouraged by the Scottish 
            Executive is in England; is concerned that Scotland will become denuded 
            of teaching centres of artistic excellence and be drained of artistic 
            talent as a result of this discrimination; believes the current position 
            of the Scottish Executive on this issue contradicts its own cultural 
            strategy that has as its key themes &quot;widening opportunities, 
            promoting education, developing and celebrating excellence&quot; and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should act in order that students 
            from across the UK can choose where to study dance, drama or stage 
            management based on the quality of course offered rather than on whether 
            or not tuition fees will be paid.</font></p>

            as an important protection of refugees throughout the world; recognises 
            that over the years this convention has made an invaluable contribution 
            in setting the standards for the treatment of refugees, including 
            their legal status, employment and welfare, and therefore joins together 
            to acknowledge the pivotal role which the convention has played and 
            to support its continuing role, which is fundamental to the maintenance 
            and development of fair and just national and international refugee 
            law.</font></p>

            in their original intention of encouraging farmers to grow commercially

            is of poor quality and low commercial value; recognises that almost

            that one-third of pensioners in Scotland are living in poverty, exactly 
            the same figure as for 1996-97 when the Labour Government came to 
            power, as disclosed in a recent Westminster parliamentary answer to 
            Robert MacLennan MP, Scottish Liberal Democrat for Caithness and Sutherland; 
            further notes that Mr MacLennan believes that Labour has &quot;wasted 
            valuable years in the battle against pensioner poverty&quot;, and 
            that &quot;the only answer is to provide pensioners with a decent 
            increase in their depleted state pensions&quot; as stated in a Scottish 
            Liberal Democrats press release of 9 August 2000; further notes that, 
            in answer to question S1W-7384 in the Parliament on 25 August regarding 
            the meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on Poverty held on 
            26 May on pensioner poverty, the outcome of the meeting was only that 
            there should be a programme of work to encourage the take-up of benefits 
            and services by pensioners; agrees with Elderly Fora throughout Scotland 
            that a decent basic state pension is the way out of pensioner poverty, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Liberal Democrat/Labour coalition to make 
            urgent representations at Joint Ministerial level to increase the 
            basic state pension to civilised levels now.</font></p>

            years ago and which are now held by the British Museum in London; 
            rejects claims by the British Museum that they can look after them 
            more effectively than the people of Greece, these being both patronising 
            and also undermined by recent evidence of defective cleaning work 
            carried out by the Museum on the Marbles; believes that, just as the 
            Scots have received back the Stone of Destiny, so the people of Greece 
            have a right to receive back one of their most important artistic 
            and cultural treasures, and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to 
            return the Marbles to their rightful home in Greece. </font></p>
