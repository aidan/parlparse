    </strong><p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-1003</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Dog Fouling</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament believes that the provisions of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 with
    regard to the offence of dog fouling are insufficient to control the behaviour of
    irresponsible dog owners and to protect the public against the growing health menace
    caused by dog fouling; notes that the provisions of Westminster legislation contained in
    the Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996 make it an offence not to clean up after one&#146;s
    dog in designated public places and allows local authorities to authorise contracted dog
    wardens to issue fixed penalty notices to offenders, and believes that equivalent
    legislation in Scotland should be introduced to effectively deter and punish dog fouling
    offences.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-1002</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Licence applications from Scotland
    regarding the Climate Change Levy</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls upon the Scottish
    Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s Government as a matter of urgency
    to determine whether the projected Department of Trade and Industry estimate of 10,000
    licence applications for exemptions from the Climate Change Levy as contrasted with the
    estimate of 600,000 by the business community has any merit and to determine the
    proportionate figures for Scotland.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-1001</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: IT Staffing for the Administration
    of Climate Change Licences</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that applications for
    exemptions from the Climate Change Levy must be lodged by December; understands that there
    are no provisions for slippage in meeting the deadline for exemptions of December 2000 and
    for the levy itself of 1 April 2001, and urges the Scottish Executive to satisfy itself
    that there will be sufficient IT staff recruited to process applications.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-1000#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie: National Lottery and Coalfield
    Regeneration</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the publication by the Department of
    Culture, Media and Sport of research into the impact of the National Lottery on coalfield
    communities; acknowledges the contribution made by coal mining and coal miners to the
    economic, social and political development of Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive
    to work with the National Lottery Charities Board&#146;s Scotland committee to maximise
    access to Lottery funding for, and work towards the regeneration of, Scottish coalfield
    areas, including Kilsyth and its surrounding villages.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-999#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: 999 Emergency Calls</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament urges all members of the public who believe themselves to be in danger to
    contact the relevant emergency service by dialling 999 without hesitation; expresses
    concern that the recent campaign to minimise use of the 999 emergency call system may
    deter members of the public from contacting the emergency services on legitimate grounds;
    expresses its support for a full examination of the implications for the emergency
    services of the continuing expansion in forms of communication such as mobile telephones,
    and urges the Scottish Executive to initiate discussions with all interested parties to
    identify a means of responding to this challenge, in particular the setting up of a
    central call system which could connect callers to the local police station.</p>

    Tricia Marwick<strong>*</strong>, Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-998</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Jubilee 2000</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament congratulates the Jubilee 2000 cyclists on completion of their round Britain
    cycle ride, organised to draw public attention to the issue of Third World debt and the
    need for cancellation of those countries&#146; debts in order that progress can be made in
    improving the education, housing and health services available to their citizens; notes
    the progress made by Her Majesty&#146;s Government in cancelling the debt of a number of
    countries, and urges other G7 nations to follow suit.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-997</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson: Diabetes UK</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes the British Diabetics Association&#146;s change of name to Diabetes UK to
    coincide with National Diabetes Week beginning on 12 June 2000; recognises its
    achievements in Scotland, and offers its encouragement in its future endeavours to
    maximise support for Scottish diabetics and their families. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-996</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: &quot;Clawback&quot; of Private
    Pensions</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a NAME="MotionText">notes the apparent unfairness
    of &quot;clawback&quot; which applies to some private companies&#146; pension schemes and
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s Government
    in order that this issue be investigated and resolved.</a></p>
