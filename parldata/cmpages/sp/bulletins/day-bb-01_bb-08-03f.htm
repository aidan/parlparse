            <strong>Christine Grahame: Borders' Children with Special Education Needs</strong>—That 
            the Parliament notes with concern that despite parental opposition 
            Scottish Borders Council at its meeting on 1 August 2001 authorised, 
            by a majority vote, further cuts of £1,579,255 to its education budget; 
            notes that £200,000 was previously cut from the budget for the provision 
            of special education auxiliaries; is concerned that part of these 
            further cuts will impact on the provision of transport for children 
            with special needs and that the intention to vire £525,000 from the 
            Excellence Fund budget to the National Grid for Learning budget will 
            impact directly on special education needs provision by raiding the 
            budget for classroom assistants, early intervention and learning support; 
            believes that this matter is causing undue distress and uncertainty 
            to parents of children with special educational needs; further notes 
            the recommendations in the 3rd Report 2001 by the Education, Culture 
            and Sport Committee, <i>Report on Inquiry into Special Educational 
            Needs</i>, in particular, recommendation 1 on &quot;Maximising the 
            participation of all children in mainstream schools&quot;, and therefore 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that the provision 
            of education for Borders children with special needs is not sacrificed 
            to rescue the Borders administration from financial mismanagement 
            and, if necessary, to provide additional, ring-fenced funding on appropriate 
            terms in order to secure a fair and inclusive education for these 
            vulnerable children.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>*S1M-2097</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: 
            Rangers FC and Celtic FC move to English Premiership</strong>—That the 
            Parliament deplores the intimations by the chairmen of both Rangers 
            and Celtic Football Clubs that they wish to leave the Scottish Premier 
            League to play in the English Premiership and believes that these 
            clubs should be investing in developing Scottish talent for the domestic 
            and international stage rather than seeking to abandon Scotland in 
            pursuit of lucrative TV deals and overpriced foreign stars.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>*S1M-2096</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: GM Crop 
            Trials</strong>—That the Parliament shares the reservations of the Prime 
            Minister concerning the future of genetically modified foods and urges 
            the Scottish Executive to bring an immediate end to GM crop trials 
            in Scotland.</font></p>

            Care Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) 
            (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) Order 2001 (SSI 2001/273) 
            be approved.</font></p>

            Support for opposition of Chief of Defence Staff to proposed national 
            missile defence system</strong>—That the Parliament concurs with the opinion 
            of the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, that 
            expenditure on the USA’s proposed national missile defence system 
            would impoverish the already overstretched United Kingdom defence 
            budget; congratulates him on this public expression of his professional 
            opinion, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations 
            to Her Majesty’s Government opposing UK participation in any such 
            system and urging it to bring pressure to bear upon the United States 
            Government to abandon its plans.</font></p>

            the issuing of a warrant for the arrest of Anton Gecas in relation 
            to the extradition request made by the Lithuanian Government on 28 
            March 2001; believes that this will be a positive step towards improved
