<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5199</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Launch of a New Alcohol Charter in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the volunteers and staff at Voice of Carers Across Lothian (VOCAL) and the Edinburgh Alcohol and Drug Partnership on the launch of the new alcohol charter in Edinburgh, which outlines the services that carers should expect when supporting someone with an alcohol addiction; notes that the alcohol charter recognises that carers looking after those with an alcohol dependency have a right to expect their views to be valued, to receive appropriate support, to inform practitioners of the ongoing situation and to inform the development of policy and services, and pays tribute to the important work carried out by carers supporting family members and friends with an alcohol dependency.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5197</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Turnbull High School, Bishopbriggs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Clare Reilly and Paul Lyons of Turnbull High School, Bishopbriggs, on winning the junior and senior sections of the 21st annual Schools Speech Contest organised by Kirkintilloch Speakers Club and notes the excellent contributions from the other contestants from Bishopbriggs Academy, Lenzie Academy, St Ninian&rsquo;s High School and Kilsyth Academy, which provided the two runners-up.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5153</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Tackling Domestic Abuse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Scottish Government for providing &pound;2.4 million to fund the Caledonian System, a new comprehensive system to address domestic abuse; believes that 50,000 cases of domestic abuse recorded in Scotland in 2007-08 is too many; further believes that this new comprehensive programme will better protect women and children through intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence to reduce the likelihood of reoffending, additional services for victims of domestic abuse and new protocols for the sharing of information between agencies involved with the families concerned, and calls on local authorities to apply for a share of the &pound;2.4 million funding to help reduce the devastating effects of domestic abuse and to make progress in reducing the cyclical nature of violence.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4762#</strong> <strong>Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Increasing Opportunities for Rural Athletes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, as part of the <em>Reaching Higher</em> revised national sports strategy, launched on 8 March 2007, the Scottish Government committed itself to achieving increasing participation and to improving performance in sporting activities; commends the Scottish Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to delivering equal opportunities for all regardless of personal circumstances; is concerned, however, that such equality has not been achieved in the field of sport, in that the careers of promising young athletes from remote areas, such as Caithness, are being held back by the high financial costs incurred in travelling to and participating in national sporting events, and would welcome the availability of funding for athletes from remote areas and their families to offset the considerable costs of pursuing their sporting goals.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4738#</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Deafblind Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the work of Deafblind Scotland, based in Lenzie, which seeks to enable Scots who are both deaf and blind to receive the support and recognition that they require to be equal citizens; notes with concern the difficulties faced by deafblind people in freely accessing public transport due to the varying restrictions placed by local authorities on concessionary travel for guide communicators who provide professional communication and guiding support, and believes that cooperation among all relevant bodies will ensure that deafblind citizens can enjoy full access to public transport.</p>
