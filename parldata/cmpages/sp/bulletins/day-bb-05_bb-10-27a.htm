<p align="center"><strong>Section A &ndash; Today&rsquo;s Business</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary  Bureau Motions</p>
<p>followed  by Executive  Debate: Delivering for Health&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-3468 Mr Andy Kerr: Delivering for Health&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament commends the action plan for NHS Scotland, &ldquo;Delivering for  Health&rdquo;, and its acceptance of Professor David Kerr&rsquo;s report, <em>Building a  Health Service Fit for the Future, </em>as the basis of NHS boards&rsquo; future service  change proposals; welcomes the report&rsquo;s emphasis on shifting the balance of  care to provide more safe and sustainable local services, including intensive  case management in the community for the most vulnerable; applauds the  commitment to tackle health inequalities by developing anticipatory care in our  most deprived communities and applying the approach to benefit people wherever  they live; supports the steps to consolidate improvements in waiting times and  to put highly specialist services on a sustainable basis, and commends the  Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policy of pursuing greater quality and productivity. </p>
  <p>The  Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3468.3 Shona Robison: Delivering for Health&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3468)  in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave  out from &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;, and considers that more needs to be  done to bring down waiting times for patients, including the introduction of  individual patient waiting time guarantees based on their particular needs, the  expansion of diagnostic and treatment centres within the NHS and the introduction  of an element of activity-based payment for hospitals to encourage greater  efficiency and utilisation of spare capacity in the NHS.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3468.1 Mrs Nanette Milne: Delivering for Health&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3468)  in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave  out from &ldquo;of NHS boards&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;to discuss the future structure of  the NHS in Scotland; welcomes the report&rsquo;s emphasis on shifting the balance of  care to provide more safe and sustainable local services, including intensive  case management in the community for the most vulnerable; welcomes the  commitment to tackle health inequalities by developing anticipatory care in our  most deprived communities and applying the approach to benefit people wherever  they live; however notes that, despite higher funding for the NHS in Scotland,  too many patients are still having to wait too long for treatment; believes  that a truly patient-centred NHS will only be possible if professionals are  given the freedom to prioritise treatment by clinical need rather than by  government targets and if purchasing power is put in the hands of patients so  that their choices determine the development of the service, and, to that end,  calls for the establishment of foundation hospitals within NHS Scotland and for  continuing increase in the capacity available to treat NHS patients by  extending the use of the independent sector.&rdquo; </p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3468.2 Carolyn Leckie: Delivering for Health&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3468)  in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave  out from first &ldquo;commends&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;notes the action plan for NHS  Scotland, &ldquo;Delivering for Health&rdquo;, and its acceptance of Professor David Kerr&rsquo;s  report, <em>Building a Health Service Fit for  the Future</em>, as the basis of NHS boards&rsquo; future service change proposals; is  concerned that the over-centralisation of services, which is against the wishes  of communities up and down Scotland, may not be prevented by all of the above;  is concerned to ensure that any change is democratic in that it actively  involves communities and staff in making the key decisions that affect service  provision; is extremely concerned about the opportunities for encroachment by  the private sector into the NHS which the report represents; notes the Minister  for Health and Community Care&rsquo;s and the Executive&rsquo;s increased communication and  collaboration with the private health care sector; notes the alarming  developments in England where the Government is attempting to transfer NHS clinical  staff to the private sector; opposes the idea that incentivisation can improve  health care and believes that the NHS is fundamentally under threat as a public  health care system and requires urgent action to protect and improve it  including increased investment in training to provide more NHS doctors,  dentists, clinicians, other professionals and valuable support staff to  increase the NHS&rsquo;s own capacity, and believes that Scotland&rsquo;s stark health  inequalities will be intensified by increased involvement of the private sector  and that the current funding mechanisms of the NHS are inadequate to address  inequalities and require wide-ranging reform.&rdquo; </p>
