            development, <em>Meeting the Needs&#133;</em> <em>Priorities, Actions

            conserves, protects and harnesses Scotland&#146;s natural resources 
            and the talents of the people; believes that the statement marks an 
            important step forward for sustainable development in Scotland; agrees 
            that the indicator list provides a good basis on which to begin to 
            measure progress, and believes that sustainable development must be

            played in maintaining a sense of community in Airdrie and surrounding 
            villages since its inception in 1878; commends the supporters of the 
            club who have endeavoured to keep the club alive over the past two 
            years, and wishes the supporters and members of the provisional supporters&#146;

            within the town.</p>

            of the Belgian Plato pilot programme for 14 small businesses in Dundee 
            and surrounding areas, providing a business-to-business support structure 
            for small- and medium-sized enterprises and partnering them with parent

          <p><strong>S1M-3062#</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Glasgow Airport 
            Rail Link</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the importance of 
            Glasgow Airport to the economy of west central Scotland, growing congestion 
            on the M8, M74 and M77, the economic and employment opportunities 
            that would be opened up by establishing a rail link to Glasgow Airport 
            and the urgent need to enhance public transport facilities serving 
            the airport; is concerned at the lack of progress on agreeing and 
            proceeding with this key project, and believes that the Minister for 
            Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning should convene an urgent 
            meeting of Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority, British Airports 
            Authority, Railtrack, Glasgow City Council, Renfrewshire Council, 
            Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and other interested parties in order

          <p> <strong>S1M-3061#</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: ME and Loss

            Week, beginning on 12 May 2002; commends research conducted in England 
            by Dr Betty Dowsett and Jane Colby which suggests that more than 50% 
            of pupils&#146; long-term school sickness absence results from ME; 
            recognises that a considerable percentage of such pupils miss many 
            years of education and social development, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should take the necessary steps to identify the extent of 
            the problem in Scotland and to address actively the problem of ensuring 
            that young Scots who lose out on education and social development 
            as a result of ME are not handicapped for life by such loss.</p>

            the Parliament welcomes the work of the Cross-Party group on survivors

            national strategy for children and adults who have experienced sexual 
            abuse during childhood and, in the light of recommendations made by 
            the recent independent inquiry commissioned by Fife Council following 
            the conviction of David Logan Murphy, believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should actively develop a national strategy, based on the work of 
            the cross-party group, that considers the wide social, health, mental 
            and legal implications of sexual abuse and its impact on survivors 
            and society as a whole.</p>

            economic regeneration emanating from Braehead in the west of Scotland; 
            welcomes the creation of new jobs there, and further notes the related

            the Political Declaration by UN member states following the Second 
            World Assembly on Ageing held in Madrid from 8 to 12 April 2002; further 
            notes that the world community recognises that we live in a world 
            of ageing populations and rising life expectancy and that signatory 
            states are obliged to review their policies on access to social services 
            and healthcare in order to promote independence and the right of everyone 
            to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical and 
            mental health, to enhance the recognition of the dignity of older 
            persons, and to eliminate all forms of unfair discrimination, neglect, 
            abuse and violence against older people; is aware of the progress 
            already being made on delivering free personal care and meeting the 
            needs and concerns of our older citizens in Scotland, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should set out its proposals, working 
            together with Her Majesty's Government, on implementing, so far as 
            they relate to older people in Scotland, the recommendations in the 
            International Action Plan including empowering older people to seek 
            and develop opportunities for service to their communities and to

            welcomes ME awareness week, 12-19 May 2002, which aims to raise the 
            profile of the disease, myalgic encephalomyelitis; recognises in particular 
            the role that the 25% ME Group based in Troon play in improving the 
            lives of people affected by ME and the lives of their families, and

            parental choice and the dismissal of the option of single vaccines; 
            further notes that the report highlights the requirement for action 
            on the Public Health Institute for Scotland&#146;s <em>Autistic Spectrum 
            Disorder-Needs Assessment Report</em>, and recommends the immediate 
            implementation of that report&#146;s recommendations.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3051#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Drug Misuse 
            in North East Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            concern that drug misuse in the north east of Scotland has increased 
            dramatically in recent years, with an estimated 50% rise in problem 
            drug users in Grampian alone between 1997 and 2000; further notes 
            that Dundee has the second highest and Aberdeen the third highest 
            level of drug misuse in Scotland and that Grampian has the highest 
            percentage of injecting drug users in Scotland, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should recognise the scale of the problem and 
            investigate the level and nature of resources that have been applied 
            to addressing this growing social problem in the north east region, 
            paying particular attention to (a) the role and accountability of 
            the various agencies involved, (b) the amount of resources dedicated 
            to drug users, (c) the cost to society in terms of loss of life, associated 
            health problems and distress caused to users' families and (d) the 
            enormous amount of drug-related crime inflicted on the local community, 
            reflected by the fact that 80% of inmates at HM Prison Aberdeen test 
            positive for drug use at reception.</p>

            that 27 April 2002 was Freedom Day for South Africa, marking the promulgation 
            of the non-racial democratic constitution in 1994; further notes that 
            Freedom Day also coincides with the first multi-racial elections in 
            South Africa in 1994 in which the ANC won 64% of the vote and Nelson

            across Glasgow and Scotland-wide for their commitment to maintaining 
            communities which are safe and secure places to live; acknowledges 
            that the problems of youth disorder must be given a high priority

            to be protected; believes that the rights of the victims of community 
            disorder must be at the centre of any initiatives on legislation to 
            tackle the problem; recognises the importance of ensuring that the 
            children's panel and justice systems are sufficiently robust to show 
            young people and their parents that there are real consequences to 
            such behaviour, and considers that the Scottish Executive and the 
            appropriate committees of the Parliament, working with local government,

            towards those who suffer from these types of condition, and considers
