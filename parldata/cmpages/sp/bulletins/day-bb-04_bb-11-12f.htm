          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></font></p>
          <p><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1996</strong> <STRONG>Pauline McNeill:</STRONG> <STRONG>Yasser Arafat</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament extends its deepest condolences to the Palestinian people for the very sad loss of their leader, President Yasser Arafat, who retained popular and unified support across Palestinian communities for 30 years; believes that President Arafat should be remembered for making the world aware of the existence and the struggle of the Palestinians as a people displaced from their homeland, and further believes that the most lasting tribute to Yasser Arafat would be international effort to ensure a viable independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to ensure the right of return of Palestinian refugees.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1995#</strong> <STRONG>Jackie Baillie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Employability Programmes for Vulnerable Groups</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success of the New Futures Fund Initiative in providing early employability programmes for people who are furthest from the labour market, including those with addiction problems, the homeless and ex-offenders; acknowledges that 21% of participants entered employment, 14% entered training programmes, 12% entered further education and 10% engaged in voluntary work; notes that the funding of the initiative ends in March 2005, and considers that the Scottish Executive should put in place a long-term strategy to provide the most vulnerable adults with effective routes out of the problems they face by providing easy access to employability programmes.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1994</strong> <STRONG>Christine Grahame:</STRONG> <STRONG>Closure of Hutton and Burnmouth Primary Schools</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision on 11 November 2004 to close Hutton, with a roll of 12, and Burnmouth, with a roll of 18, primary schools in Roxburghshire and Berwickshire in the face of fierce resistance from parents; further notes with concern that these closures will tear the heart out of these communities; believes that these proposed closures must be referred to the Minister for Education and Young People, and urges him to reject these closures which are not in the interests of the children or the community.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1993#</strong> <STRONG>Rob Gibson:</STRONG> <STRONG>Membership of the Convention of the Highlands and Islands</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should extend invitations to future meetings of the Convention of the Highlands and Islands so as to include all MSPs elected in the area and should afford them full speaking rights.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1992</strong> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Hearts Memorial</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling of a memorial in the French village of Contalmaison to Heart of Midlothian players killed during the Battle of the Somme; recognises the sacrifice that saw seven players, Duncan Currie, John Allan, Thomas Gracie, James Speedie, James Boyd, Ernest Ellis and Harry Wattie, never return and 11 other players wounded or gassed; further recognises that their patriotism and valour inspired many other players and supporters from other clubs to enlist; commends the work of Jack Alexander whose book, <EM>McCrae&rsquo;s Battalion</EM>, directly led to the memorial being established, and welcomes the support of the Scottish Executive, the City of Edinburgh Council and other clubs such as Hibernian FC for this fitting tribute.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1914.1</strong> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Voting Irregularities in the US Presidential Elections</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1914) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the US Presidential Elections have been conducted with minimal disruption and with a record turnout in six states as over 120 million people across America exercised their right to vote; considers this a tremendous success in contrast to the first elections to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 when considerably long delays were experienced as over 2000 votes went uncounted in Lothians and votes in the City of Edinburgh Council elections were similarly uncounted; notes the increase in turnout in the United States of America with 60% of the electorate casting a ballot in comparison with the reduced Scottish Parliament turnout in 2003 of 49%, and considers it inappropriate in the circumstances to suggest that the United States has anything to learn from MSPs on the conduct of a full and fair democratic election.&quot;</font></p>
