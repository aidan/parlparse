          <p>9:30 am&#9;Debate on Closing the Opportunity Gap for Older People- 
          </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4064</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Closing 
            the Opportunity Gap for Older People</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the Scottish Executive's commitment to close the opportunity 
            gap for Scotland's older people by building first-class public services 
            and developing initiatives in health, transport and other priority 
            areas, which will support older people in living healthy, active and 
            independent lives.</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-4064.2</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson:</strong> 
                <strong>Closing the Opportunity Gap for Older People</strong>-As 
                an amendment to motion (S1M-4064) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, 
                leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes that life expectancy 
                in Scotland is among the lowest in the developed world; further 
                notes that Scottish Executive health targets entrench age inequalities; 
                accepts that ageism is a reality in modern Scotland and must be 
                countered; is aware that 25% of Scottish pensioners live in poverty; 
                acknowledges that more coherence to the concessionary fare scheme 
                is required; seeks more flexibility in delivering the central 
                heating programme; desires that the postcode lottery of free personal 
                care places be ended; recognises that older people have a vital 
                part to play in our democracy; is concerned at continuing reductions 
                in the value of the state pension in real and relative terms; 
                demands that the closure of final salary scheme pensions be addressed 
                to prevent future generations of older people being left with 
                low incomes, financial insecurity and dependent on means-tested 
                benefits, and believes that to address the needs of older people 
                in Scotland the Parliament needs the full powers of an independent 
                sovereign state."</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-4064.1</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Closing 
                the Opportunity Gap for Older People</strong>-As an amendment 
                to motion (S1M-4064) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave 
                out from &quot;by&quot; to end and insert &quot;but notes that 
                its policies are not working, care homes are having to close due 
                to a funding crisis, waiting lists and times are rising, more 
                older people feel insecure in their homes and there is an insufficient 
                level of provision of appropriate housing for older people and 
                considers that, if the Chancellor was to abolish his punitive 
                stealth tax on pension funds in the forthcoming budget, the opportunity 
                gap for older people would be greatly reduced.</p>

            Northern Partnership and Social Inclusion Partnerships</strong>-That 
            the Parliament commends the work done by the Great Northern Partnership 
            (GNP) in Aberdeen; notes that the GNP plays an important role in improving 
            quality of life and extending opportunities for those living there,
