            for being one of 20 Scottish voluntary organisations that have achieved 
            the annual Queen's Golden Jubilee Award for outstanding commitment

            career was launched in Glasgow after the band was signed to Creation 
            Records following a gig in the city's King Tut's venue; further notes 
            the increasing difficulties faced by young bands in Glasgow and throughout 
            Scotland in getting gigs and a breakthrough in the music industry, 
            and calls on Noel Gallagher to return to Partick to host a showcase

            insert "believes that only a fully costed programme of investment 
            in transport infrastructure with detailed start and completion dates, 
            rather than platitudes, will deliver the improvements to public transport 
            that the travelling public and Scottish business so desperately need 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to present such a programme to 
            the Parliament forthwith."</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-130.2</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Investing 
            in Public Transport</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-130) 
            in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;recognises that the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
            transport policy has failed the people of Scotland and that, therefore, 
            it must radically alter this policy; believes that what Scotland needs 
            is a publicly owned and accountable transport system covering rail, 
            bus, ferry and air services, including adopting the principle of road 
            equivalent tariffs and public service obligations for our Highlands 
            and Islands communities, and that these should be administered by 
            a national transport network; further believes that a socially just 
            transport system that puts communities before cars should be the prime 
            concern in any public transport investment, and, to that end, calls 
            on the Executive to reprioritise its transport policy, putting people 
            first and delivering a safe, affordable, efficient, integrated and 
            environmentally friendly transport system for all based on the provision 
            of services and not on the generation of profit, as in the example 
            of the M74, and to instigate a full public inquiry into the M74 proposal.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-130.3</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong>

            to motion (S2M-130) in the name of Nicol Stephen, insert at end &quot;notes 
            that the delivery of tangible improvements within defined timescales 
            is essential; recognises, furthermore, that in order to achieve these 
            an integrated and inter-modal public transport network is required, 
            and therefore calls for the transfer of the legislative and financial 
            powers to the Parliament that are necessary to address fully rail 
            and aviation services in addition to bus and ferry services in order 
            to ensure the delivery of the network sought.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-130.4</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Investing

            in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;envisages a transport system that minimises 
            adverse environmental impact, meets the basic transport needs of every 
            member of society, protects public health and serves a sustainable 
            economy, and believes that the solution lies in increasing investment 
            in public transport infrastructure and services, controlled wherever 
            possible by the communities and customers that use them&quot;.</p>

            out from &quot;; considers&quot; to end and insert "which has led 
            to serious decline in fish stocks and risks permanent damage to marine 
            biodiversity; considers that the terms of the final draft constitution 
            should be subject to the approval of the Scottish people in a referendum 
            prior to ratification; regrets that the Chancellor of the Exchequer's 
            tests in relation to the euro did not address either social impact 
            or the risks to policies promoting sustainability, if public spending 
            is subjected to the Growth and Stability Pact of the European Central 
            Bank; believes that the decision by Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to delay entry to the single currency was in Scotland&#146;s best 
            economic, social and environmental interests, but further believes

            concern at the clearly federalist objectives of the current proposals 
            of the Convention on the Future of Europe; pledges to analyse the 
            detail of these proposals as they affect devolved responsibilities 
            and report back our objections to Her Majesty's Government along with 
            our view that, given the conclusions drawn up by HM Treasury over 
            the last six years on the United Kingdom entering the European single 
            currency, there is no basis for the United Kingdom surrendering the 
            pound for the euro and that further uncertainty on monetary union 
            will be bad for Scottish interests, and urges Her Majesty's Government 
            to hold an early referendum on both the Convention proposals and European 
            monetary union."</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-124.3</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Europe</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-124) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave 
            out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes in 
            a socially just, democratic and accountable Europe for citizens and 
            not big business; further believes that the structure of the current 
            European Union undermines democracy within Scotland and that any further 
            attempt to centralise political power in Brussels, or financial decisions 
            at the European Central Bank in Stuttgart, would not be in the interest 
            of ordinary Scots; is concerned that the economic agenda of European 
            monetary union has the intention of furthering the aims of capitalist 
            globalisation and the interests of trans-global corporations, resulting 
            in lower wages, cuts in public services and a wholesale onslaught 
            against workers&#146; pensions; demands the right of the Scottish 
            people to make their views known through a referendum; opposes entry 
            to the euro, and calls on the Scottish Executive to offer to host 
            the 2004 annual anti-globalisation event, the European Social Forum, 
            involving up to 100,000 people, that has already taken place in Florence 
            and will meet in Paris in November 2003.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-124.4</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Europe</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-124) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave 
            out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the 
            many benefits that the European Union (EU) has delivered for Europe 
            and for Scotland; continues to believe that the EU should seek to 
            become more effective, efficient, democratic, transparent, accountable 
            and easier to understand; notes the work of the Convention on the 
            Future of Europe towards these objectives; further welcomes the submission 
            to the convention of the proposals on Europe and the regions drawn 
            up by the Scottish Executive in conjunction with Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government and the Welsh Assembly Government; further notes with approval 
            the references in the draft Constitutional Treaty under consideration 
            in the convention to the role of the regions, and to mechanisms for 
            consulting them; welcomes the intention of Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to involve the devolved administrations in the operation of the subsidiarity 
            mechanism proposed by the convention, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to continue to work with other sub-member state administrations and 
            Her Majesty&#146;s Government to ensure that Scottish interests are 
            fully taken into account during the forthcoming Inter-Governmental

            of Kinship Care</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that 
            many grandparents have become the new foster care parents of children 
            whose mothers and fathers have become disconnected from mainstream 
            society; acknowledges that such care arrangements are more stable 
            and have a positive impact on the young person as a result of grandparents&#146; 
            strong sense of values in respect of providing care, but share concerns 
            about the financial consequences experienced by grandparents in providing 
            this care, should they have to leave work early or reduce their working 
            hours, and therefore *considers that* the Scottish Executive *should* 
            recognise this form of kinship care by giving it the attention and 
            social work resources that it deserves and by making recommendations 
            to *local authorities and* Her Majesty&#146;s Government to offer 
            these grandparents, many of whom are pensioners, the same level of 
            financial support as other foster carers.</p>
