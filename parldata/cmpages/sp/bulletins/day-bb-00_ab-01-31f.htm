    the Parliament believes that in a modern Scotland concerned with social justice for all
    there is no place for the concept of &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot; of children; that
    children should have the same protection under the law as adults from being hit; that a
    new, modern legislative framework would be the best basis from which to promote positive
    discipline; that such policies would keep more children safe, support families and assist
    in the development of a less violent, more caring society, and that failing to scrap the
    Victorian defence of &quot;reasonable chastisement&quot; and trying to define where a
    child can be hit, how a child can be hit and with what a child can be hit, is a recipe for
    confusion and fear for parents and fails children in the new millennium.</p>

    the Parliament recognises the geographic reality that some students in the South of

    practicality of transport links or a social need to stay at home and attend the university
    course available at the place most conveniently near to their home; recognises that the
    choice of the place of study for these students is not simply an academic choice but is
    one of practicality and necessity, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to produce
    proposals which ensure that those students in the South of Scotland who require to study
    in the North of England out of geographic or social necessity rather than academic choice
    can do so on the same financial basis as students resident in Scotland studying in
    Scotland.</p>

    retailers by the declining sales of large cigars, which have fallen 64% over the past
    decade and are still declining; acknowledges that UK duty on cigars is the highest in
    Europe, and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to give consideration to replacing the
    present weight related duty on cigars by duty on a specific per unit basis, which would
    simplify the calculation and collection of tax duty, and could increase revenue overall as
    a result of the potential reduction in personal imports and illegal trafficking.</p>

    Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive is proposing a

    figures for England and Wales are respectively 41.6 pence and 41.2 pence; notes that the
    Scottish Executive have accordingly abandoned the uniform business rate policy; fears that
    this will make Scotland a less attractive location in the UK for large businesses and that
    this is a retrograde step that will harm the Scottish corporate sector and undermine the
    benefits received from the harmonisation of cross border business rates in the 1995
    re-valuation; calls upon the Executive to re-visit the calculation of the poundage rate
    and ensure the continuation of the UBR across the UK; to bring forward proposals to
    provide for smaller businesses a method of relief which remedies the unfair burden which
    they face in their business rates bills and to esimate what impact its policy of higher
    business rates for Scotland will have on the level of unemployment and the Scottish
    economy over the next five years.</p>
