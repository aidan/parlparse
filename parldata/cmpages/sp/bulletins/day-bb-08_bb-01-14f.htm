<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1123</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scientific Whaling - Commercial Whaling in Disguise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the ongoing actions of the Japanese whaling fleet, which on 18 November 2007 left Japan for the Southern Ocean to kill 935 minke whales and 50 fin whales for scientific whaling; considers scientific whaling, carried out primarily by Japan and Norway, to be cruel, unnecessary, barbaric and nothing more than commercial whaling in disguise, and supports the work of organisations such as Greenpeace which monitors whaling fleets to show the world the terrible cost of scientific whaling and campaigns to secure a global ban on this needless slaughter.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1122</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Accessing BBC Local Content Using Catch-Up TV Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the lack of BBC Nations and Regions news and current affairs output on the Catch-Up TV service provided by various cable television suppliers; believes that it is unacceptable that viewers in Scotland and BBC regions in England can access only the London region content of the Politics Show and other news and current affairs programmes through this service; recognises that &quot;on demand&quot; services are currently being promoted as a reasonable expectation of licence-fee payers; further believes that this situation strengthens the case for control of broadcasting to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, and considers that the BBC should take swift action to ensure that viewers throughout the UK have equal access to relevant local content.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bashir Ahmad<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Shirley-Anne Somerville<strong>*</strong>, Bill Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1121</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Woodland Trust Scotland&rsquo;s Christmas Card Recycling Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Woodland Trust Scotland&rsquo;s Christmas Card Recycling Scheme which runs until 31 January 2008 in conjunction with Waste Aware Scotland; urges people to help exceed this year&rsquo;s Scottish target of 10 million recycled Christmas cards by taking their cards to special recycling bins placed in participating WH Smith, Tesco, TK Maxx and M&amp;S stores; encourages people who do not traditionally recycle to participate in the scheme, and notes that funds raised from the scheme will help to save woods and trees and will contribute towards the Woodland Trust&rsquo;s projects to create new woodland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1120</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Fund to Clean Homes after Murders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that around 20 to 30 families each year have to pay for the cost of cleaning up their own homes after a murder has taken place there; recognises that the costs of a clean-up can vary from &pound;200 to &pound;3,000; further recognises the stress and strain that this can cause to the families of murder victims who are still coming to terms with their loss, on top of attending to funeral arrangements, and calls on the Scottish Government to establish a fund to cover the costs of cleaning up homes after a murder to help bereaved families at a very difficult time.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1115</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Disability Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Leonard Cheshire Disability report, <em>Disability Poverty in the UK</em>, finds that disabled people are twice as likely as non-disabled people to live in poverty; further notes that in Scotland 48% of disabled people are in employment which compares unfavourably with the fact that 80% of non-disabled people are in employment and that disabled people who are not expected to work are often trapped in inescapable poverty; further notes that disabled people can experience poverty in a number of ways including financial poverty, poverty of aspiration and poverty of opportunity; believes that the extent of disability poverty is unacceptable, and calls on all parties to work together to bring about change to tackle as a priority disability poverty in all its guises.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1113</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Addressing Long-term Unemployment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Child Poverty Action Group&rsquo;s position that the way to assist long-term unemployed people is not to add further benefit sanctions, but rather to introduce positive measures such as tackling poverty pay, encouraging flexible hours and developing childcare, and in particular calls for positive measures to tackle poverty traps such as the loss of housing benefit at 65 pence in the pound and council tax benefit at 20 pence in the pound for every pound earned over the benefit thresholds, effectively a super tax on the poor, by changing the rules to allow people to keep more of their earnings before losing these benefits.</p>
