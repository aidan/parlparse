<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3530</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Full Fiscal Autonomy Through Independence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of <em>Fiscal Autonomy in Scotland: the case for change and options for reform</em> by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth on 24 February 2009, which argues that full fiscal autonomy through independence would both help Scotland deal with short-term issues like the global downturn and put the country on the best path for a more successful future, unlike other options short of independence, and acknowledges that the Scottish Government is continuing to do everything within its current powers to ease the economic crisis, such as lowering business rates, freezing the council tax until 2012 and offering debt advice to constituents, but that more could be done with further fiscal powers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3529</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Cumbernauld RFC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament opposes the decision to eliminate Cumbernauld RFC from the Scottish Cup tournament; believes that it is a poor example to grassroots participants for clubs from the Scottish regional leagues to be removed from a competition in favour of teams from the national leagues; notes that research shows that matches at Murrayfield during the 2008-09 season will bring an estimated &pound;50 million net spending to the Edinburgh economy; is disappointed that the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) does not recognise the economic benefits that Cumbernauld RFU&rsquo;s participation in this tournament brings to the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area, and calls on the SRU to reverse this unfair decision and allow Cumbernauld and St Boswell&rsquo;s to play their postponed Scottish Cup matches.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3528</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Marine Bill Consultation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to deliver a Scottish Marine Bill to drive sustainable economic growth and improve the stewardship of the seas around Scotland; acknowledges the positive response to the consultation, <em>Sustainable Seas for All,</em> and the widespread support for the proposals, and further notes the recent agreement with the UK Government to secure executive responsibility for marine nature conservation and planning in the offshore zone.</p>
<p>Supported by: Roseanna Cunningham<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3527</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>European Victims&rsquo; Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 19 to 24 February 2009 is European Victims&rsquo; Week; further notes the findings of the European Union Crime and Safety Study that showed that in 2005 Britain had the highest coverage rate of support agencies for crime victims, with Scotland topping the league table of countries providing specialist support to victims of crime; acknowledges the hard work undertaken by all the individuals and agencies who provide a high quality of service to victims of crime, and encourages the Scottish Government to support Victim Support Scotland&rsquo;s call to establish a victims&rsquo; commissioner for Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3526</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Roundabout Improvements in West Dunbartonshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the need for improvements to the traffic flow at Kilbowie roundabout and Hardgate Cross roundabout; welcomes the fact that West Dunbartonshire Council recognises the continued problems associated with traffic in this area, and encourages it in its efforts to tackle the problems.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3525</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Don&rsquo;t Silence the Pipers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the future of Strathclyde Police Pipe Band is in jeopardy; acknowledges that the band has its origins in 1883, was set up by public request and was endorsed by an act of Parliament; further notes that the band has been a regular feature at the five major events of the pipe band calendar, the Scottish, British, European and World Championships, as well as the Cowal Highland Gathering, but that this will be cut to playing at only two in 2009; congratulates the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band for continued success in the prize list at these major competitions and for being outstanding ambassadors around the world for Strathclyde Police, Scotland and piping; notes the record attendance for the band&rsquo;s performance at this year&rsquo;s Celtic Connections; welcomes the increasing investment in other Scottish police force pipe bands, and calls on the chief constable to consider carefully the move to silence the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3524</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>King Robert the Bruce&rsquo;s Palace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament hails the finding of remains indicated to have been King Robert the Bruce&rsquo;s palace, lost for more than 700 years, beneath the Pillanflatt in Renton; notes that Robert the Bruce is known to have lived in Renton from 1326 until his death in 1329 but before this finding archaeologists and citizens were only able to guess where the king&rsquo;s house was; highlights that the buildings on the Pillanflatt, meaning &quot;pavilion of the great hero&quot;, are said to stretch from Dalquhurn to Dalreoch and are believed to include the king&rsquo;s manor house, which had a grand hall of 100 feet, a queen&rsquo;s quarter and a chapel; recognises the importance that this finding holds for Scottish heritage, and calls on Scottish citizens to embrace this discovery that has so remarkably advanced the transparency of their history, particularly during the year of Homecoming Scotland 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3523</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>East Dunbartonshire China Learning Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes East Dunbartonshire Council well in the establishment of its China Learning Centre; congratulates the council on the informative presentation, in English and Mandarin, given at the opening ceremony at St Ninian&rsquo;s High School, Bishopbriggs, and encourages all pupils in the catchment area to participate in the Confucius Classroom Hub, which provides information about Chinese culture and language and will help develop good relations between Scotland and China.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3522</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Obstructing Global Artistic Expression</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the petition campaign by leading figures in the arts world calling for a reversal to the new stringent visa controls that are preventing top foreign musicians, actors, scholars and artists from visiting Scotland and the wider United Kingdom; notes with concern the new UK Border Agency (UKBA) regulations requiring foreign artists not only to prove their identity with biometric data, fingerprint scans and digital photographs but also to show that they have an established sponsor willing to take full financial responsibility for them while in the country and to vouch for all their activities while on British soil; notes with concern the huge impact that this will have on both host organisations and visitors, which has already resulted in a number of cancelled shows, and finally believes that the UKBA should encourage and promote the entry of talented global musicians, actors, scholars and artists interested in contributing to Scottish and UK cultural, intellectual and civic life.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3521</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Designation of Lead Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee be designated as the lead committee in consideration of the Arbitration (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3519</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Arms Embargo of Israel and Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Amnesty International report examining foreign arms supplies to Israel and Gaza; notes with concern the evidence produced by Amnesty International that UK exports of conventional military equipment to Israel increased in the four year period from 2004 to &pound;10.4 million and that UK exports almost doubled in the last year for which there are figures, further notes the failure of the UK Government to end-use-monitor components licensed for export to Israel from UK companies, and supports Amnesty International&rsquo;s call for a complete and immediate arms embargo of Israel and Gaza in order to end any future war crimes through the use of weapons sourced from and supplied by the United Kingdom and other EU countries.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3518</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Healthy Living Centre Transition Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the continuation of the healthy living centre transition fund through 2009-10; believes that the fund will afford healthy living centres throughout Scotland time to secure sustainable local funding for their invaluable services; acknowledges the great work done by the centres in promoting health, education and culture in the local community, and encourages centres to make full use of the extra funding available to secure their long-term future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3517</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Border Television</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 24 February 2009 marks the end of Border Television news broadcasts to the Borders, south of Scotland, Cumbria, north Northumberland and the Isle of Man from its Carlisle studios before its closure and sale, with the flagship news programme, Lookaround, to be produced in Gateshead, with a 15-minute opt-out for the former Border region from a combined Border and Tyne Tees news service; believes that Border Television and its Carlisle news studio provided its viewers with well-informed, local and entertaining news coverage for nearly 50 years and did much to protect the strength of local identity and cross-border links in the essentially rural communities that it served; further notes that Border Television acted as a valuable platform in the careers of some of the most highly-regarded broadcasters in the United Kingdom; regrets that the qualities of Border Television and the strength of public opinion in the Border region were insufficient to persuade Ofcom not to allow the merger with ITV Tyne Tees, and hopes that the spirit and quality of Border Television, and particularly its emphasis on the importance of strong local stories in news gathering, can be carried forward under the new arrangements from Gateshead.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3516</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Firefighter Deaths in the Line of Duty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the tragic loss of three firefighters while carrying out their duties in Scotland in 2007-08, the highest death toll in over 30 years; calls on the Scottish Government to take note of the concerns highlighted in the Fire Brigades Union report, <em>In the Line of Duty</em>; notes the concern expressed in the report that records are not kept systematically and may not accurately reflect the actual number of deaths and at the absence of a common definition of reportable deaths; calls on the Scottish Government to consider the need for a properly resourced central body with responsibility for recording and investigating firefighter deaths and other serious incidents and for the development of safety-critical operational guidance arising from those investigations, and calls on the Scottish Government to work constructively with other devolved administrations and UK Government departments on these issues.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3515</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Threats to Wildlife through Loss of Set-aside</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the amount of land in the set-aside scheme fell by 71%, from 63,000 to 18,000 hectares, over the course of 2008; considers that this represents a huge loss of undisturbed habitat for declining numbers of farmland birds, wildflowers, insects, including bees and butterflies, and other associated wildlife; acknowledges the Scottish Government&rsquo;s current consultation on the options available to redress the balance, <em>Consultation on the Review of Species Listed on Schedule A1 and 1A of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</em>, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that a sufficient percentage of cultivated land is managed for environmental purposes.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3449*#*</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>The Commonwealth @ 60</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the theme of Commonwealth Day 2009, the Commonwealth @ 60 serving a new generation, which highlights the importance to every nation of the understanding of and contribution to making improvements to lives, particularly those of young people, across the Commonwealth; notes that this also marks the 60th anniversary of the Commonwealth and recognises the valuable role of the Commonwealth in strengthening relationships between nations across the world; welcomes the continued contribution of Scotland and its people to those relationships; reaffirms its support for the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) and commends the CPA for its work to raise awareness on energy and climate change, human trafficking and all initiatives targeted at improving parliamentary democracy; also notes that, during the third session of the Parliament, the CPA Scotland branch continues to develop relationships with Malawi and other CPA branches; commends the Scottish Government for its continuing commitment to Malawi and other Commonwealth countries, and further notes Scotland&rsquo;s longstanding work throughout the Commonwealth.</p>
