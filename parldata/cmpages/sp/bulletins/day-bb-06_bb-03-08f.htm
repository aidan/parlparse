<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4073</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>Drug Abuse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the increasing drugs problem in Scotland which has seen rises in the number of drug-related deaths and drug-related crimes; recognises that drug abuse destroys lives, tears families apart, leads to widespread and recurring crime and the disintegration of entire communities; believes that there should be a zero tolerance drugs strategy which aims to rid Scotland of drugs; believes that such a strategy should place an emphasis on early intervention and include a coherent education programme which prioritises abstinence, and believes that there needs to be a change in the help offered to drug addicts, away from an over-reliance on methadone and towards a drug-free lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4072</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>&quot;I am concerned for you to enjoy yourself within the limits of British decency&quot; - Death of Ivor Cutler</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep sadness and regret at the death of poet, singer, songwriter and storyteller, Ivor Cutler, who was born and bred in Glasgow; extends its condolences to his surviving family and friends; notes the profound influence that Cutler had on fellow Scots, Billy Connolly and members of the band, Franz Ferdinand, as well as Bertrand Russell, The Beatles and John Peel, and recognises the outstanding contribution which he made to his art and Scottish culture through his unique insight and wit.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4039</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Shirley McKie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees with Lord McCluskey, retired High Court judge and former Solicitor General for Scotland, that one of the fundamental principles underlying the rule of law in a mature democracy is the principle that justice must be seen to be done; considers that in the case of Shirley McKie issues have arisen implying that justice has not been seen to be done, and, in further agreeing with Lord McCluskey that the issues involved are not party political but go to the heart of public trust in the criminal justice system, calls on the Scottish Executive to consider how the concerns expressed by Lord McCluskey should be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4039.1</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Shirley McKie</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4039) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &quot;issues&quot; to end and insert &quot;the public is still not satisfied that the truth of the matter is all available; recognises that the McKie family campaign is not satisfied that there was no conspiracy against her; also recognises that the four Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) fingerprint workers are furious that their competence and reputation has been sullied; believes that the Scottish Executive has a duty to address all these concerns, and calls for a public inquiry to get to the truth of this matter and to restore public confidence in the SCRO and the fingerprint service as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4039.2</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Shirley McKie</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4039) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &quot;with&quot; to end and insert &quot;that action needs to be taken to restore public and professional confidence in the Scottish Fingerprint Service; acknowledges that in 2000 the SCRO Fingerprint Bureau was the subject of an independent inspection by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC); notes that following three further inspections HMIC reported that its 25 recommendations had been fully discharged; notes that further reforms are being taken forward; that the Minister for Justice has instructed the interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Police Services Authority to bring forward, by the end of March, a comprehensive action plan drawing on the best available international scientific advice and management expertise; notes that this action plan will be reported to the Parliament; believes that a public inquiry is not appropriate; notes that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to hold the Scottish Executive to account; welcomes the work already commenced by the Justice 1 Committee, and confirms the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to co-operate with any inquiries that the Parliament may decide to take forward in scrutinising these reforms.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4036</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, despite assurances from ministers that Scottish Water&rsquo;s investment plans were on target, the Chairman of Scottish Water has resigned due to disagreements with ministers and Scottish Water has been required to produce another business plan; considers that these events highlight poor stewardship of the water industry by the Scottish Executive; expresses its concern over the impact of delays in investment in water and sewerage infrastructure on economic, environmental and social development in Scotland, and calls on the Executive to set out promptly what impact these events will have on delivering the ministerial objectives for the water industry in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4036.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4036) in the name of Rob Gibson, leave out from &quot;and calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;further expresses concern that Scottish Water is failing to deliver an appropriate level of service to its customers; notes the concerns of the building community about Scottish Water&rsquo;s failure to allocate sufficient resources to remove development constraints; further notes the Executive&rsquo;s admission on 9 February 2005 that business customers have been overcharged &pound;44 million a year for water; further notes that the introduction of surface water drainage charges based on the size of the property are to be introduced into the denationalised English water market on 1 April 2006 which will lead to significantly lower charges for small businesses in England than in Scotland, thereby reinforcing the present competitive disadvantage faced by Scots firms; further notes the comments of former Environment Minister, Sam Galbraith, that &quot;We are slowly going broke and the only way to solve this is to reduce the public sector wage bill. Privatise water and, at a stroke, the bill is cut&quot; (<em>The Scotsman</em>, 10 February 2005); believes that as long as Scottish Water remains a bureaucratic, nationalised monopoly it will struggle to adopt the private sector disciplines expected by the Executive and the Water Industry Commission, and therefore calls on the Executive to take its commitment to make economic growth its top priority seriously by creating a genuine market in water and privatising Scottish Water or adopting a &quot;not for dividend&quot; model such as Welsh Water.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4036.2</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4036) in the name of Rob Gibson, leave out from &quot;,despite&quot; to end and insert &quot;Scottish Water&rsquo;s draft business plan of April 2005 stated that achieving Scottish Ministers&rsquo; objectives for 2006 to 2010 would require a capital investment programme of &pound;3.7 billion and a doubling in customer charges; notes that the Water Industry Commission&rsquo;s determination of charges for 2006 to 2010 allowed Scottish Water a capital investment programme of &pound;2.1 billion and charges rising by less than the rate of inflation to achieve the objectives; notes that Scottish Water accepted the determination but its plan demonstrating how it would deliver the objectives within the limits set by the determination was judged by the Executive, supported by the regulators, not to meet the requirements in a number of material aspects; notes that the Executive has required Scottish Water to produce a new plan which will command the confidence of Ministers and regulators, and considers these actions by the Executive to represent good stewardship of Scottish Water in the public and customer interest.&quot;</p>
