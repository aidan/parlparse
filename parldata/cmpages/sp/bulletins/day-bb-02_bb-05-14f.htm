          <p><strong>*S1M-3100</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Scottish Local 
            Government Funding Crisis</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication 
            of the report <em>Grant Distribution and the Mismatch Effect: An Assessment 
            of its Impact on Councils since Reorganisation</em> by Professor Arthur 
            Midwinter; recognises the report's conclusions that Argyll and Bute, 
            Dundee City, Glasgow City, Inverclyde, Midlothian and West Dunbartonshire 
            councils have suffered due to the reorganisation of local government 
            to the tune of £50 million per annum; further recognises that this 
            additional grant would allow an average reduction in council tax of 
            £112, and calls on the Minister for Finance and Public Services to 
            take account of this financial injustice in advance of the local government 
            settlement for 2003-04.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3099#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Funding Mismatch 
            for Local Authorities</strong>-That the Parliament notes the erosion 
            of grant income resulting in a severe funding mismatch for six local 
            authorities, including Glasgow City Council, as identified in a specially 
            commissioned report by Professor Midwinter of Strathclyde University; 
            further notes that the mismatch occurred as a direct result of local 
            government reorganisation in 1996 following which grant income fell 
            4.6% for these local authorities against a Scottish average drop of 
            1.2%; expresses concern at the direct affect that these budgetary 
            restraints have had on council tax payers with a 20% increase in the 
            affected authorities against a Scottish average of 16%; recognises 
            that Glasgow City Council and the other five councils have since operated 
            at a financial disadvantage; supports the call of the six local authorities 
            and Professor Midwinter for restoration of £50 million, £32 million 
            going to Glasgow, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            rectify this mismatch immediately and ensure equitable distribution 
            of future grant increases.</p>

            the Scottish Executive's commitment to developing a fire service that 
            is modern, effective and efficient and which will also have a specific
