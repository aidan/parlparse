<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only  printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the  complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is  published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains any motions lodged  for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for  debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol  (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in  the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party  support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a  declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3713 Pauline McNeill: Job  Losses in Scottish Newspapers&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern the  plans for cuts across their range of newspapers by Trinity Mirror plc; notes  that whilst their advertising levels have dropped they recently announced a 20%  rise in profits; wishes to show support for the position of the National Union  of Journalists, who oppose further cuts in editorial budgets, and recognises  that daily and weekly newspapers are the lifeblood of the community and that it  wishes to remind Trinity Mirror plc that there are responsibilities attached to  owning newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3712 Christine Grahame: Rose,  Cindy and Susan&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the visit to the Scottish  Parliament of Cindy Sheehan, Rose Gentle and Susan Smith, mothers of sons killed  in Iraq; recognises the work these women are doing in exposing, with great  personal dignity and courage, the bloody reality of UK and US involvement in  Iraq; regrets the decision by the First Minister of Scotland not to meet these  women and that this represented a missed opportunity for him to explain his  support for Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government in this war, which is widely considered to  be illegal, and why it is necessary for young men from Scotland, England and  the United States of America, together with thousands of civilians in Iraq, to  die in the pursuit of oil.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3711 Tommy Sheridan: Closure of Scottish Mirror and Cuts at the Daily Record and Sunday Mail&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament condemns the decision of Trinity Mirror Management  to close down the Scottish Mirror, with the loss of 32 jobs, and the swingeing  cuts proposed at the Daily Record and the Sunday Mail, which represent cruel  industrial vandalism and will result in severe distress for those made  redundant and lead to a real reduction in the quality of Scottish news  coverage; supports trade union action to resist these disgraceful cuts, and  expresses solidarity with the sacked Mirror workers.</p>
<p>Supported by: Frances  Curran<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>S2M-3710 Sarah Boyack: Social and Environmental Accountability and Investment&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament notes the proposal in the Make Poverty History campaign manifesto  that &ldquo;we need to [make companies] more accountable for their social and  environmental impact both here and abroad&rdquo;; notes that this proposal is echoed  in the priorities suggested by the Trade Justice Movement for UK action in  advance of the December 2005 World Trade Organisation meeting; notes campaigns  at UK and Scottish levels for legislation to require enhanced transparency from  companies and to ensure that companies are held legally accountable for the  social and environmental impacts of their business operations both in the  United Kingdom and overseas; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to  make Scotland a fair trade country, and notes strong support for the Executive  to take a lead in supporting high standards of corporate behaviour within  Scotland by the promotion and implementation of socially responsible  procurement and investment practices throughout the public sector.</p>
