<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4779</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Newly-released Ministry of Defence Documents Indicate Nuclear Risk at Faslane</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern Ministry of Defence internal safety reports regarding the risk of a major nuclear accident at Faslane Naval base, newly released following a freedom of information request by the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament; considers that these reports state that plutonium from up to 48 nuclear warheads could potentially escape and cause widespread contamination and cancers if there was to be an accident while a Trident submarine was being moved by the on-base shiplift facility; further notes with particular concern that in the released reports the numbers regarding how far the contamination could potentially spread, how many cancers it might cause and how probable such an accident may be have been redacted; believes that the content of these reports reveals the gravity of the risk that Trident poses to the Scottish public, and calls on the UK Government to abandon plans to renew what is widely believed to be the irrelevant Trident weapons system and remove all nuclear submarines from Scottish waters.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4778</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Bannerman High School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils of Bannerman High School, Glasgow, on their recent academic achievement in the summer 2009 diet of SQA Examinations; notes that the pupils&rsquo; results were top among Glasgow schools for achievement in SCQF levels 3 and 4; also notes that achievement at SCQF level 5 was second among Glasgow schools; recognises the hard work of the teachers and support staff at Bannerman High School in helping the young people to achieve their potential; wishes the young people of Bannerman High the very best in their futures, and calls on the Scottish Government to work to ensure that there are opportunities available for all those school leavers in Scotland with regard to employment, education and training.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4777&diams; </strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Rights for Constituents to be Represented by Members of the Scottish Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the apparent refusal of the UK Border Agency to work with members of the Scottish Parliament seeking to represent constituents in Glasgow; considers that constituents should have the right to be represented by any of their elected representatives, be they councillors, MSPs, MPs or MEPs; considers that the Scottish Parliament is a legitimate body of representation for the people of Scotland, as is recognised by other government agencies in Scotland and the UK, and believes that constituents, who are often vulnerable asylum seekers, have the right to choose who should represent them.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4775</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland (LTCAS) on recruiting its 100th member, Cancer Support Scotland (Tak Tent); considers that, with two million people already living with at least one long-term condition, this milestone highlights the need for Scotland to rise to the social and economic challenges that such conditions present; recognises that, alongside the NHS and social care services, the voluntary sector plays a vital role, with voluntary organisations providing high-quality services, peer support, advice and information; also considers that for many people this makes the difference between their opportunities being severely limited and being able to manage their conditions and enjoy a high-quality, productive life; recognises the invaluable role of LTCAS in providing a focal point for these organisations, and acknowledges LTCAS as a key strategic partner that brings the voice of people living with long-term conditions to the heart of policy making.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4774</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Mental Health Awareness Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the objectives of Mental Health Awareness Week from 5 to 11 October 2009; recognises that mental health problems affect one in four people in Scotland and that 61% of people in Scotland know someone who has a mental health problem; further notes that people with mental health problems continue to face stigma and discrimination and experience a high rate of unemployment; supports the objectives of the forthcoming Scottish Association for Mental Health (SAMH) forum to be held on 9 October 2009, which will gather together mental health service users from across Scotland to discuss mental health improvement and their concerns about services, and recommends that all MSPs use this week to campaign for improved mental health services across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4773</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Collection</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle collection of 40,000 items, including photographs, personal papers, first editions and many other items of considerable interest, bequeathed by the late Richard Lancelyn Green to the city of Portsmouth in 2005, remains to be fully catalogued, with most of the collection languishing in storage, just two unpaid volunteers working part time on the project and no sign of any building or display facility despite a commitment by the local authority to have the cataloguing complete by 2007; further notes that Mr Lancelyn Green&rsquo;s preference, if Portsmouth was unable to display the collection, was for it to come to Edinburgh; regrets that this unfortunate situation has arisen, and calls on the Scottish Government to do what it can to help negotiate the possible transfer of the collection to National Museums Scotland, which has the expertise and personnel to catalogue, conserve, archive, house and display this unique collection as intended for the benefit of the public and in accordance with the wishes of the late Mr Lancelyn Green.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4772</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh&rsquo;s Last Scout Post</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the news that, after 25 years of excellent service to communities across the city, Edinburgh&rsquo;s scout post Christmas delivery service has now been cancelled; applauds all those involved in the service over the years for their hard work and dedication and the thousands of pounds raised for charities at home and overseas, and hopes that scout groups across the city can find alternative ways of raising much-needed funds.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4771</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Wear it Pink 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that over 4,000 women and 20 men in Scotland will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year; endorses Breast Cancer Campaign&rsquo;s organisation of wear it pink on Friday 30 October 2009; notes the importance of the event in promoting awareness of breast cancer among the general public; encourages MSPs to participate in the initiative to help raise funds for innovative world-class breast cancer research at centres of excellence throughout the United Kingdom, and congratulates Breast Cancer Campaign and all of its supporters for having raised &pound;3.5 million in 2008 through wear it pink.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4770</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety on behalf of the Public Petitions Committee:</strong> <strong>Inquiry into the Public Petitions Process</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions contained in the Public Petitions Committee&rsquo;s 3rd Report, 2009 (Session 3): <em>Inquiry into the public petitions process </em>(SP Paper 300).</p>
<p>Supported by: John Farquhar Munro<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4769</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Addition of Folic Acid to Wheat and Grain Products</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the sudden rise in babies born in Scotland with neural tube defects; recognises that folic acid supplements reduce the incidence of babies born with neural tube defects; further recognises that the neural tube forms in the first 28 days of pregnancy and in the case of unplanned pregnancies the neural tube has formed before a woman is aware that she is pregnant; notes that an estimated 50% of pregnancies are unplanned; further notes that the incidence of neural tube defects in Canada dropped by at least 54% after grain products were fortified with folic acid, and therefore supports the addition of folic acid to flour and other grain products sold in Scotland in order to reduce dramatically the number of children born in Scotland who suffer from neural tube defects.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4768</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Andrew Banks and Pentland Ferries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Andrew Banks of Pentland Ferries for the work that he has done since the inception of Pentland Ferries in 1997; notes that Pentland Ferries receives no state aid to support its service; further notes that the recent addition of the MV Pentalina is a welcome boost to passengers as it can carry 250 passengers, 32 cars and nine articulated lorries, with a service speed of 18 knots making the crossing from Gills Bay to St Margaret&rsquo;s Hope less than one hour; acknowledges the perseverance of Andrew Banks who has literally built up the business since 1997, constructing the pier at Gills Bay, and wishes Pentland Ferries continued success for the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4767</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Power of Scotland Renewed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication by Friends of the Earth Scotland, the World Development Movement, WWF Scotland and RSPB Scotland of a new report, <em>The Power of Scotland Renewed</em>; welcomes its findings that by 2030 renewable energy could meet between 60% and 143% of Scotland&rsquo;s projected annual electricity demand, even when avoiding sensitive wildlife and landscape sites; believes that this demonstrates that centralised power plants can be rapidly replaced by more decentralised forms of generation; further believes that this vindicates the view that a new generation of nuclear power in Scotland is not needed, and calls for priority to be given to energy conservation and renewables and the supporting framework required to decarbonise electricity generation.</p>
