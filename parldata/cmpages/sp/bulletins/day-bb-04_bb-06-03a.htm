          <p>9.30 am&#9;Executive Debate on the Economy of the Highlands and Islands-</P>
          <p>&#9;<strong>S2M-1395</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Economy 
            of the Highlands and Islands</strong>-That the Parliament endorses 
            the ambition to create a diverse, dynamic and sustainable economy 
            in the Highlands and Islands; congratulates Highlands and Islands 
            Enterprise on the progress it has made with local partners towards 
            realising this ambition, particularly in the areas of telecommunications, 
            research and development and renewable energy; further welcomes the 
            significant investment in critical transport infrastructure in the 
            Highlands and Islands; recognises that serious challenges still lie 
            ahead for the Highlands and Islands economy, not least in terms of 
            sustaining more fragile areas, but believes that these can best be 
            addressed through continuing the approach set out in <em>A Smart, 
            Successful Scotland</em>. </P>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1395.2</strong> <strong>Jim Mather: Economy of the Highlands 
            and Islands</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1395) in the name 
            of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and 
            insert &quot;believes that the Highlands and Islands have both the 
            right and the potential to be an economy that is diverse, dynamic 
            and sustainable; commends the progress that has been achieved to date 
            by individual endeavour, quality local services, business resilience 
            and innovation in spite of hurdles which must be overcome in order 
            for that potential to be realised; considers that these hurdles include 
            the threats to primary and acute healthcare, the failure of the Scottish 
            Executive to mount a coherent campaign for the contribution of adequate 
            EU structural funds, the lack of affordable housing, poor transport 
            links, higher fuel costs and an overall failure adequately to address 
            the needs of key industries, and urges the Executive to produce a 
            comprehensive strategy that will overcome these inhibitors and enable 
            the Highlands and Islands to achieve its full potential.&quot; </P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1395.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Economy of the 
            Highlands and Islands</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1395) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;congratulates&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;acknowledges that the long-term economic decline 
            of the Highlands and Islands was reversed under the last Conservative 
            government; believes that strong businesses are essential in bringing 
            about further economic growth in the Highlands and Islands; notes 
            with concern that businesses in the Highlands and Islands continue 
            to be hampered by high business rates, excessive regulation and poor 
            transport infrastructure; recognises, particularly, the need for improvement 
            of the A9 as the major strategic link between the central belt and 
            the north, and calls on the Scottish Executive to improve the business 
            environment in the Highlands and Islands by lowering business rates, 
            cutting regulation and investing in transport infrastructure improvements.&quot; 
          </P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1395.3</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott: Economy of the 
            Highlands and Islands</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1395) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;, particularly&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;; notes the lessons to be learned including 
            the need to engage with, and invest in, local communities in areas 
            such as telecommunications, research and development and renewable 
            energy; further notes the need for investment in sustainable transport; 
            recognises that serious challenges still lie ahead in terms of sustaining 
            more fragile areas, and endorses the view expressed in <em>A Smart, 
            Successful Scotland - the Highlands and Islands dimension,</em> that 
            economic growth must be achieved in tandem with no less important 
            aspects of Highlands and Islands life such as social cohesion, vibrant 
            cultures and natural environment, and that development activity must 
            remain aware of the legacy it leaves for the future.&quot; </P>

          <p>&#9;<strong>S2M-866</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Asbestos-Related 
            Illnesses</strong>-That the Parliament notes with deep concern recent 
            projections regarding the increasing prevalence of asbestos-related 
            illnesses in Scotland; notes that the historic concentration of heavy 
            industry on Clydeside has left a devastating health legacy, affecting 
            many former shipyard and engineering workers and their families; notes 
            that although former shipyard communities show the highest incidence 
            of asbestos-related disease, evidence now shows that ever-increasing 
            numbers of workers from other parts of Scotland have also become victims 
            of asbestos-related illnesses due largely to the past use of asbestos 
            in construction; considers that the Scottish Executive should give 
            urgent consideration to bringing forward an integrated strategy to 
            assist all those affected by asbestos-related illnesses, which should 
            combine screening and testing people who may have been at risk in 
            order to ensure early diagnosis, counselling and support for victims 
            and their families, and the provision of specialist palliative care, 
            and further considers that the Scottish Executive should work along 
            with COSLA, NHS boards and other key bodies, including the Health 
            and Safety Executive to ensure that necessary information is made 
            available to potential sufferers from asbestos-related illnesses and 
            all those professionals in health, local government and other services 
            who may be in the position of assisting victims and their families.</P>
