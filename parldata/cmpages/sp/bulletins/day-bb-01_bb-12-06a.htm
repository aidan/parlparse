                        persistent offending by a very small minority of young 
                        people; recognises the importance of early intervention 
                        measures, of youth work and of increased sports, leisure 
                        and educational opportunities in enabling all young people 
                        to fulfil their potential and to steering many young people

                        the proposals to achieve these objectives including (a) 
                        mapping the coverage and effectiveness of community-based 
                        programmes to tackle persistent offending, (b) using the 
                        partnership opportunities provided by the multi-agency 
                        youth justice teams to develop more systematic early intervention 
                        measures and to improve the quality of information provided 
                        to the children&#146;s hearing about the offending behaviour 
                        and how re-offending could be prevented and (c) identifying 
                        how restorative justice approaches can prevent the offender 
                        re-offending and build the confidence of victims in our
