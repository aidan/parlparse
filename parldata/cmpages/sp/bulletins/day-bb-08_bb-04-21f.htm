<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1741&diams; </strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Canine Partners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the arrival in Scotland of Canine Partners, the  Assistance Dog charity that opens doors to independence, based in Milnathort; notes that a trained dog can free a disabled person from total dependence on carers; recognises that this provides much-needed respite and support for family carers, including children; notes the potential for an assistance dog to reduce by a third the number of hours per week required by a disabled person of an approved carer; welcomes the saving that this represents of up to &pound;65,000 over the working life of a dog, and believes that some of this saving could be put towards the Direct Payments scheme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1740&diams; </strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>World Asthma Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes World Asthma Day on 6 May 2008, which will see the launch by Asthma UK of its &quot;Wish you were here?&quot; campaign to highlight the significant variation in asthma services throughout the United&nbsp;Kingdom; recognises that asthma is a major public health issue, with 400,000 people in Scotland having asthma, resulting in over a quarter of a million GP consultations and thousands of hospital admissions each year; believes that every school should have an asthma policy to ensure that children with asthma are given every opportunity to take part in normal school life, and further believes that more effective diagnosis, treatment and management to put more people in control of their asthma should be prioritised as part of a national respiratory strategy, similar to strategies being adopted in Wales and Northern Ireland, that ensures sharing of best practice and a joined-up approach to respiratory conditions across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1739</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Shetland Museum Leads for Scotland in Art Fund Prize 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Shetland Museum and Archives for winning through to the final shortlist of four museums competing for the Art Fund Prize 2008; notes that this is the result of the hard work of the staff involved in running the museum; further notes that this news will not surprise the many visitors who have visited the exciting new museum and archives since it was opened last year and who have enjoyed its well-presented displays set in the impressive complex of new and restored buildings at Hays Dock in Lerwick, and calls on all Scots to get behind the Shetland Museum and Archives as it competes against three museums in the south of England before the winner of the Art Fund Prize 2008 is announced on 22 May.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1738</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Teachers Right to Anonymity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Educational Institute of Scotland and Scotland&rsquo;s Commissioner for Children and Young People in their call for teacher anonymity to be protected until the point that they are convicted by a court and encourages the Scottish Government to establish a review of current practices involving all stakeholders, including unions, the commissioner, teachers, lawyers and representatives of the media, to consider what is an extremely sensitive but also very important issue of fairness and justice.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1724</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Offensive Anti-Scottish Campaign by the English Democrats</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the offensive publicity campaign by English Democrats candidate for the London Mayoral elections, Matt O&rsquo;Connor; believes the use of slogans such as &quot;Chop Jock, Vote English&quot;, &quot;Tartan Terror&quot;, &quot;Repatriate the Prime Minster&quot; and &quot;Save London from Labour&rsquo;s tartan taxes&quot; as well as pictures including a robber wearing a tartan balaclava are inflammatory, border on the racist and ignore the important contribution which Scots make to the whole of the United Kingdom, including London; is particularly concerned that such billboard posters have appeared in Scotland despite being for the elections for the Mayor of London, and believes that such narrow-minded nationalism will rightly appal people from and across all parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1722</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Concern at Edinburgh Community Mediation Service Budget Cut</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern a 29% cut in the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s grant to the Edinburgh Community Mediation Service for this financial year; further notes that, since inception of the service in 1995, the council&rsquo;s support of mediation as a cost-effective resource to combat antisocial behaviour and promote community safety has served as a model for local authorities elsewhere in Scotland; believes that this cut will make it extremely difficult to effectively deal with referrals, especially at a time when mediation is embedded in the council&rsquo;s procedures for all complaints concerning neighbour conflicts and that the now required strategy of prioritising casework would be contrary to the lessons learnt in the service&rsquo;s history that even seemingly small disputes can escalate to antisocial behaviour and criminal charges, and consequently urges the council to reconsider this cut and the Scottish Government to revisit its settlement with the council given that it is clearly precipitating unprecedented cuts in services, particularly those affecting vulnerable groups and of which the Community Mediation Service is sadly just one example.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1703&diams; </strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>The Unforeseeable Outcome of SNH Management Agreements</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that some 150 farmers in Orkney and across Scotland, who entered into management agreements with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) under which they reduced the livestock numbers on their land during the single farm payment scheme reference period, suffer a loss of income after their SNH management agreement and the associated compensation ends as their single farm payment is based on their reduced livestock numbers rather than on the numbers they would have had if they had not entered into an SNH management agreement; further notes that, in September 2007, SNH made a proposal to ministers for payments to the farmers who suffered the loss on income, a proposal which required ministerial agreement before any payment could be made; believes that the SNH proposal offered a practical way of reducing the losses which the farmers suffered and which they could not have foreseen when they entered into the SNH management agreements; expresses its grave concern that ministers have withheld their agreement to the SNH proposal so that the farmers receive no compensation for their losses, and is concerned that this is not only an attack on natural justice but that it will also make farmers wary of entering into further agreements with SNH if they risk suffering unforeseeable losses in the future.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1654</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Statute Law (Repeals) Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the Statute Law (Repeals) Bill, introduced in the House of Lords on 27 February 2008, relating to Statute Law Repeal, so far as these matters fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1596#</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Yes to Bathgate Business Improvement District</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the hugely successful outcome of the ballot to establish the first Business Improvement District (BID) in Scotland in Bathgate, West Lothian; further notes that out of 205 votes cast by local businesses, 190 were in support of the BID proposals and congratulates the BID steering group chairperson, Sam Crawford, his implementation group colleagues, Amanda Finlayson and Pat Kerr, and all others involved in developing the Bathgate BID on their amazing success; acknowledges that the ballot result is an overwhelming endorsement by the business community of the BID concept, and hopes other Scottish towns may follow in Bathgate&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1539#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Leven to Thornton Rail Link</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the South-East Scotland Transport Partnership commissioned a feasibility study into the reopening of the Leven to Thornton rail link; believes that the reopening of this line to passengers and freight is vital to the regeneration of the Levenmouth area; notes that the reopening of the Leven to Thornton rail link is one of Fife Council&rsquo;s top transport priorities, and believes that those most interested in the regeneration of Levenmouth should contribute to the feasibility study now being carried out.</p>
