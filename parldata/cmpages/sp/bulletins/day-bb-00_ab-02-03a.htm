          <p ALIGN="left">S1M-482 Kay Ullrich: </b>National Health Service in Scotland&#151;That the
          Parliament recognises the debt owed to NHS staff at all levels in relation to their
          commitment over the winter period and through the flu outbreak; acknowledges that without
          this commitment on the part of the staff, the NHS in Scotland would not have coped over
          this period; recognises that the flu outbreak exposed an NHS in Scotland that is
          struggling to deliver high-quality patient care, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to
          acknowledge the problems that exist and to provide the necessary resources to ensure that
          the health service is adequately equipped and funded to provide optimum health care for
          the people of Scotland.<i> </i><b></p>

            planning than ever before, record levels of investment and effective partnership working
            brought about by the abolition of the internal market has enabled the NHS to deal
            effectively with exceptional pressures and unprecedented levels of activity over the
            winter period; and welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Executive outlined in Making it
            Work Together: A Programme for Government to work in partnership with the health service

          <font FACE="Arial"><b><p ALIGN="left">S1M-483</b> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> Air Passenger
          and Freight Links to Scotland&#151;That the Parliament recognises the vital importance of
          airlinks and air Infrastructure to Scotland and the Scottish economy in the 21st century;
          acknowledges the potential for economic growth through improved air links; condemns the
          proposed privatisation of the National Air Traffic System and Her Majesty&#146;s
          Government&#146;s failure to ensure that Fed Ex remain at Prestwick, and calls for
          government action to retain air traffic control in the public sector, save associated jobs
          and promote economic prosperity by increasing direct air passenger and freight links to
          Scotland.<i><strong> </strong></i></font></p>

            potential for economic growth through improved air links, supports the development of a
            new Air Traffic Control Centre at Prestwick funded by private capital, calls for the
            acceleration of the Scottish Airports and Air Services Study and effective surface access
            strategies for Scotland&#146;s major airports, and calls for urgent assurances that other
            freight operators will be authorised to carry freight traffic currently carried through
            Prestwick Airport by FedEx.&quot;<b><i> </p>

            leave out from &quot;in the 21st century&quot; to end and insert &quot;and acknowledges
            the potential for economic growth through improved airlinks; notes that the future of air
            traffic control and associated issues are a reserved matter outwith the remit of the
            Parliament, but recognises that there are concerns and that the Liberal Democrats are
            opposed to the development of the air traffic control system by public private
            partnership; strongly supports a two centre strategy to protect jobs at Prestwick;
            underlines the need to give the highest possible priority to air safety, and further notes
            that during the second reading of the Transport Bill in the House of Commons on 20
            December 1999, no Scottish National Party MP spoke in the debate, and only one voted
            against the second reading of the Bill.<i><strong> </strong></i></font></p>
