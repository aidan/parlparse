            Glasgow Schools PFI</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 

            article in the <i>Sunday Herald</i> of 9 July by Torcuil Crichton 

            suggesting that the PFI deal for Glasgow schools is likely to cost 

            taxpayers £34 million more than if the schools were built and refurbished 

            in the public sector and calls for a full investigation by Audit Scotland 

            and the local government ombudsman.</font></p>

            figures revealed by the Registrar General showing that Dundee's population 

            is set to decline by 20,000 over the next 15 years and therefore calls 

            for an urgent enquiry into the causes of Dundee's depopulation and 

            for all appropriate action necessary to be taken to reverse this decline.</font></p>

            that the incidence of autistic spectrum disorder has rapidly increased 

            in the last ten years; further notes the challenge faced by parents, 

            carers and organisations such as Strathclyde Autistic Society regarding 

            the lack of appropriate provision, and urges rapid action to address 

            and rectify the current situation.</font></p>

            Fibromyalgia Syndrome</strong>-That the Parliament notes Fibromyalgia Syndrome 

            Awareness Week from 10 to 16 September; recognises that the condition, 

            which affects up to 4% of the population, is frequently overlooked 

            or minimised by health professionals; recognises the problems sufferers 

            have in claiming appropriate benefits; supports the demand for better 

            education and awareness-raising about the condition, and calls for 

            more research into the condition so that Fibromyalgia Syndrome is 

            taken seriously as the devastating &quot;hidden&quot; disability that 

            it is.</font></p>

            worker to deal exclusively with women over 50 years of age and/or 

            disabled women and notes that this is the first project of its kind 

            in the United Kingdom; expresses its concern at the apparent increase 

            in the abuse of older and disabled people, and believes that the Scottish 

            Executive should support and encourage projects which seek to highlight 

            and tackle this important issue.</font></p>
