<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4571</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>The Importance of Modern Studies in Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the importance of modern studies in the secondary school curriculum; believes that modern studies provides an essential element of young people&rsquo;s awareness and understanding of citizenship, politics, global issues and the many dimensions of poverty, justice and peace in the world, and agrees that modern studies should continue to be taught in S1 and S2 and be provided as an option for Standard Grade and Higher Still courses.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4570</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Growing Community Assets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Big Lottery Fund&rsquo;s Growing Community Assets investment area on 2 May 2006; notes that its key aim is to help communities obtain assets such as buildings and land that will help them become stronger and more sustainable; further notes that the fund is designed so that people lead the regeneration of their own area using assets that help create more local income and employment; believes that this community-led regeneration will help build social capital, enable people to become more involved in decisions about how their local area is developed, and lead to more sustainable development at the local level, and urges all MSPs to help to spread the word about Growing Community Assets so that communities across Scotland can benefit from the &pound;50 million available, the biggest ever investment in community ownership of assets in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4569</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Labour MPs Failing on Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route VAT Issue</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns Aberdeen&rsquo;s Labour MPs for their backing of HM Treasury&rsquo;s stance on imposing VAT on the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route project; notes that the former Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning has stated publicly that there was no notification from HM Revenue and Customs that it was looking at imposing VAT, and calls on these MPs to rethink their position and back the campaign to have this VAT liability waived.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-4568</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>General Dental Council (Professions Complementary to Dentistry) Regulations Order of Council 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the General Dental Council (Professions Complementary to Dentistry) Regulations Order of Council 2006 (SI 2006/1440).</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4567</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>The Draft Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006 (Consequential Modifications) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the draft Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006 (Consequential Modifications) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Hugh Henry</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4566</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Barnardo&rsquo;s and Support for Children Abused Through Prostitution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that a long-term study has been carried out by Barnardo&rsquo;s into its work with children who have been exploited for sex or groomed for abuse through prostitution; understands that the research indicates that early intervention in the lives of these young people reduces their risk of exploitation and helps them achieve positive changes in their lives; commends Barnardo&rsquo;s Glasgow Street Team for its work supporting children and young people at risk of sexual exploitation but is concerned that such support depends more on geography than need, and looks forward to local authorities across Scotland developing the protocols for working with young people at risk of sexual exploitation, as called for in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s 2003 strategy on vulnerable children.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4563</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that on 12 June 2006 the Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston, refused to meet a cross-party delegation of MSPs, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, a former Lord Advocate and representatives of Scotland&rsquo;s trade unions, churches and civic society and that Aldermaston did not respond to the delegation&rsquo;s concern that over &pound;1 billion is being spent on new facilities at Aldermaston which are likely to be used to design and build new nuclear weapons that would be deployed in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Westminster Government in respect of its plans for Aldermaston.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4562</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Crofting Reform etc. Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Crofting Reform etc. Bill, agrees to any expenditure or increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in Rule 9.12.3(b)(iii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4561</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Closure of the National Minimum Wage Helpline for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the scourge of low pay in the United Kingdom, which, disgracefully under the Labour Government, has not been eradicated; notes that people caught in the poverty trap of low pay are more likely to be in debt and work longer hours to make ends meet as, for example, low-paid workers are more likely to have signed an opt-out of the EU Working Time Directive 48 hour maximum with their employers to make more money and could be working up to 80 to 100 hours per week; further notes that low pay results in poverty, debt, rent and mortgage arrears, poor health, stress, lower life expectancy and malnutrition and, for example, many working parents on low pay will ensure that their children have a meal and go without themselves; also notes the abolition of the wages councils and the introduction of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 allowing for a national minimum wage which employers must pay to their workers otherwise they are breaking the law and can be prosecuted and fined, as well as having to pay employees the backdated arrears; notes that since 1998 there have been many breaches of the national minimum wage regulations by employers and backdated arrears have been awarded to workers, but there has been not one prosecution of any company for breaking the law; further notes in this connection the significance of the National Minimum Wage Helpline for Scotland, which was set up in 2003, based at the office of the Scottish Low Pay Unit and funded by HM Revenue and Customs and the Department of Trade and Industry; condemns the Government&rsquo;s decision to cease funding the helpline, which means that it will have to close at the end of June 2006 if alternative funding is not found and notes that in 2005 the helpline achieved over &pound;15,000 in back pay for low-paid workers in Scotland who had not been paid the National Minimum Wage; notes that the helpline advised 1,003 low-paid workers and received enquiries from every single local authority area in Scotland and that after June 2006 low-paid workers in Scotland will have to call a helpline in Newcastle which is run by the UK Government and whose hours are going to be reduced while it operates as a helpline for the whole of the United Kingdom; further notes that the Scottish Executive has been contacted and asked if it will fund the National Minimum Wage helpline, which covers the whole of Scotland, to ensure its survival and notes that there has not yet been a positive response; further notes increasing cuts in the voluntary sector in Glasgow, such as the closure of the Scottish Human Rights Centre and the Scottish Civic Forum; believes that these cuts specifically target services for the most vulnerable communities and that when services are cut, not only do workers lose their jobs, but the entire community of low-paid workers, especially women as well as people of different race and ethnic backgrounds, loses valuable services; therefore challenges the cutting by the Government of a valuable helpline in Scotland which helps the poorest workers when at the same time it can spend millions of pounds on a war in Iraq that benefits no-one and calls on the Scottish Executive to secure the current funding and consider long-term funding of the helpline; regards it as a priority that enough public money in Scotland is made available to help the poorest paid workers in Scotland to enforce their right to a national minimum wage with independent professional advice, as well as catering for the needs of a rapidly expanding migrant workforce from Eastern Europe in Scotland who are being exploited as workers and frequently need advice on the national minimum wage, and considers that this has increased resonance at a time when the money needed to keep the helpline open, &pound;36,000, is insignificant when compared to the millions that it cost to build the Scottish Parliament and the public money that Scottish Enterprise has wasted in building up debts instead of creating jobs.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4560</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Buried News</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes, and expresses its disgust at, the announcement by the Minister for Health and Community Care of the closure of the Coldstream and Jedburgh cottage hospitals at exactly the same time that the Parliament was debating the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill; recognises that this was a shabby and relatively successful ploy to bury this bad news for eastern Borderers; recognises that this decision ignores the communities&rsquo; wishes, as expressed in meetings, including with the Minister, marches and petitions, and also ignores the thrust of the Kerr report on keeping such services local and comes and at a time when services for elderly people in the Borders are overstretched, and therefore calls for the coalition government to respect those communities and reverse the decision.</p>
