          <p><strong>*S1M-3988</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell: Maternity and 
            Paediatric Services at the Inverclyde Royal Hospital, Greenock</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the ongoing threat to maternity 
            and paediatric services at the Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Greenock 
            and further notes that, in the spirit of the Scottish Executive's 
            <em>Partnership for Care: Scotland's Health White Paper</em>, any 
            reduction in maternity or paediatric services would seriously undermine 
            the Executive's key philosophy of a patient-focused health service 
            in Scotland. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3987#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: International Women's 
            Day</strong>-That the Parliament notes the significance of International 
            Women's Day on 8 March 2003; welcomes the fact that this observance 
            continues to recognise the struggles and achievements of women throughout 
            history and highlights the ongoing plight of women across the world; 
            acknowledges the impact that campaigning organisations such as Zero 
            Tolerance, now celebrating its tenth year in operation, have had on 
            the lives and experiences of many women within our own country, and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure continued support 
            for such organisations and congratulates Zero Tolerance on their 10 
            years of campaigning on the issue of violence against women in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3986</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Record of the 
            Scottish Executive</strong>-That the Parliament notes that four years 
            of government by Labour and the Liberal Democrats in Scotland have 
            not achieved the better public services and stronger economy that 
            people in both our urban and rural communities were led to expect 
            and believes that Scotland needs an Executive that will undertake 
            a coherent programme of reform designed to boost Scotland's economic 
            performance and improve our public services by reducing the burden 
            of tax and red tape, empowering parents, professionals and local communities 
            and increasing choice and accountability.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3985 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Bill - Business Motion</strong>-That
