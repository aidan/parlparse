<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5031</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Excess Winter Deaths in Glasgow and Clyde</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the massive increase in excess winter deaths in the 0 to 64 age group in the Glasgow and Clyde area in 2005-06, which have risen from 20 in 2004-05 to 130 in 2005-06, a rise of some 550%; notes that these are excess winter deaths; recognises that many families and individuals in Glasgow and Clyde remain trapped in cold damp housing which can exacerbate existing underlying health conditions, such as heart and respiratory conditions, and that multiple housing deprivation has been recognised as posing a health risk that is of the same magnitude as smoking and, on average, greater than that posed by excessive alcohol consumption; further notes that air quality in Glasgow remains very poor, which can also exacerbate underlying health conditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to undertake an inquiry to ascertain the cause of the rise in excess winter deaths in the 0 to 64 age group and, further, to address the problems of cold damp housing and to fully implement the air quality strategy for Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5030<> </strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Tackling the Diversity Deficit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to host the Commission for Racial Equality&rsquo;s policy reception, entitled &quot;Tackling the Diversity Deficit in Scottish Politics&quot;, on 7 November 2006, which will bring MSPs together with individuals from across Scotland to explore why some ethnic groups are under-represented in Scottish politics and what can be done to address this, and is committed to engaging all of Scotland&rsquo;s citizens in Scotland&rsquo;s decision-making processes and to continuing to encourage the engagement of under-represented groups, particularly ethnic minorities, in all aspects of the Parliament&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5028#</strong> <strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>What Is Your Idea of Happiness?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the young people from the Chill Out Zone in Bathgate and the older people from Whitdale residential home in Whitburn for coming together to produce the DVD, &quot;What is your idea of happiness?&quot;, which showed that, while there are many years difference in their ages, young and old share many of the same hopes and dreams and love of music and hopes that experiences such as this will bring about a greater understanding of those of a different age.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5025</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Scottish Monument in Flanders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the people of Zonnebeke in Flanders for their efforts in raising funds to build a Scottish monument, a Celtic cross made from Corrennie Pink granite from Scotland, which will be dedicated to all the Scottish soldiers who fought in the Great War, wherever they came from; notes that it is not aimed at glorifying war but that its sole purpose is to remember all Scottish involvement, from the Canadian Scottish to the 1st South African Brigade which was part of the 9th (Scottish) Division; further notes that there is no monument at present in any part of the Ypres Salient dedicated to any Scottish regiments and that this monument will be a tribute to every Scottish soldier, whatever his regiment; recognises the efforts of the local authorities of Passchendaele, Wytschaete and Messines for their planning of year-long events in 2007 to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Third Battle of Ypres, otherwise known as &quot;Passchendaele&quot; in which there were over 500,000 British and German casualties, and further recognises that the Celtic cross will be an important, permanent reminder in keeping alive the memory of the Scottish soldiers from the Great War and will also serve as a wonderful testament to the people of Flanders in showing their thanks for the sacrifice of the Scottish soldiers and also to those Scots whose final resting place is far away from home in &quot;Flanders Fields&quot;.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5007</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Support for Traditional Farming</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the replacement of traditional farming methods with intensive farming initiatives with devastating impacts on both the environment and the local community; notes that in many areas in the developing world farming communities have followed low-impact traditional farming practices successfully for many years; further notes that traditional methods, including mixed cropping, provide a nutritionally diverse diet to the local community and greater resilience to pests and local weather conditions; notes with concern, however, that in many countries traditional farming methods are under threat from intensive farming methods with their emphasis on high yields, the use of agri-chemicals, high-yielding hybrids, mechanisation and monocultures, which are detrimental to both the environment and local communities, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do all it can to encourage traditional farming methods, both at home and abroad, and to seek to aid farmers in the developing world in their attempts to resist changes to their faming methods and allow them to keep control of their farming and their communities.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5004</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Drug Treatments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the recent announcement by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) that it has rejected all appeals and that drugs to treat Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease will in future only be available on the NHS to people with moderate Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; recognises that this means that people with mild Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease will no longer be eligible for treatment; notes that the current cost of the treatments is less than 0.3% of the total NHS Scotland drugs budget; is aware, however, that these treatments have been assessed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network as clinically effective at all stages of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; notes that memantine, currently widely prescribed across Europe and the United States of America for the treatment of severe Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, is also not being recommended for use; acknowledges that the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Royal College of General Practitioners also believe that these drugs are effective treatments in improving quality of life for people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; is concerned that NICE&rsquo;s appraisal focused solely on statistical, clinical and cost-effectiveness information and did not take into account the wider positive impact that these drugs can have on the lives of people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and their families, including maintaining independence for longer and alleviating the impact of the disease on carers&rsquo; own health and quality of life; notes that NICE&rsquo;s decision applies in England and Wales and takes effect on 22 November 2006; is aware that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) will publish its comment on the guidance on that date, which will then set the rules for NHS boards in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to listen to the views of patients, carers and clinicians alike, as well as any guidance from NHS QIS, and consider adopting a different position in Scotland to allow people at all stages of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease to continue receiving the medication that their GP or consultant recommends.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4991</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Female Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that women in sub-Saharan Africa are more than 1.5 times as likely as men to contract HIV and that millions of women in Africa have difficulty understanding practical health information; further notes that more than 10,000 girls per day will get married before they turn 15 and that 60% of the 110 million children out of school are girls; notes that one in three women and girls in the developing world live on less than $2 per day; recognises that educated girls and women are less vulnerable to HIV infection, human trafficking and other forms of exploitation and are more likely to marry later, raise fewer children who are in turn more likely to go to school, and make important contributions to family income; further recognises the role that girls&rsquo; and women&rsquo;s education plays in reducing risk of infection and exploitation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that female education is raised at the highest levels of talks with leaders in sub-Saharan countries.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4988</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>House Price Rises and Lack of Affordable Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the recent rises in average house prices in Scotland are unsustainable and that lack of new social housing is fuelling inflation in house prices, making both buying and renting increasingly unaffordable to those on low incomes, and therefore calls for an end to right-to-buy and for substantial investment by the Scottish Executive in the building of new local authority and housing association properties for affordable rents to meet the obvious need that rising house prices signify.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4987</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>A Manifesto for Life Sciences in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent document produced by the BioIndustry Association Scotland, entitled <em>Manifesto for Life Sciences in Scotland</em>, which sets out key recommendations for all Scotland&rsquo;s political parties to follow in order to create a healthier and more prosperous Scotland; recognises that the life sciences sector is a success for Scotland, with 592 companies and institutions employing over 20,700 people and contributing over &pound;800 million per annum to the Scottish economy; appreciates that the sector is highly competitive and that the right conditions are important for the sector to grow and for such important jobs to stay here, and considers that the Scottish Executive should support this manifesto in order to continue the success of life sciences as part of a thriving Scottish economy and to realise the human healthcare benefits that life sciences promise.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4986</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Ann Gloag and the Right to Roam</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Ramblers Scotland in its court battle against Ann Gloag; believes that no landowner, however wealthy, should place themselves above the law of the land and that right to roam legislation will have little meaning if landowners use their wealth to inflict onerous costs on those wishing to gain access to their land, and believes that, if right to roam access is to be maintained, the Scottish Executive needs to make itself a party to any future appeals that arise from the Gloag case.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4985</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>European Week for Safety and Health 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes this year&rsquo;s European Week for Safety and Health 2006 - Safe Start for young workers; notes that young workers are often more susceptible to damage from exposure to toxic substances which may not become apparent until much later in life; further notes that young people&rsquo;s bones and muscles are still developing and that heavy repetitive work can lead to muscular and skeletal problems and impaired growth; further notes that in the European Union the injury rate for workers aged 18 to 24 is more than 40% higher than other age groups, that in just five years it is estimated that 50 under-18s have lost their lives in UK workplaces and nearly 13,000 were badly injured and that at least 45 children and young people have died and more than 400 have been seriously injured on farms in the last 10 years; recognises that over a quarter of a million young people are involved in apprenticeship programmes in the UK, some of which involve the 14 to 16 age group; notes with concern that a recent TUC poll found that 37% of 15 to 24-year-olds had not had any health and safety training, and therefore calls for the Scottish Executive to do all it can to ensure that Scottish employers understand and implement the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 for all employees, including providing a safe workplace, safe systems of work, safe plant and equipment, instruction, training and supervision, and safe use, handling, storage and transport of articles and substances.</p>
