            Scotland (CSBS) on schizophrenia which shows that there is a postcode 
            lottery in the provision of mental health services; further notes 
            the comments made by Lord Patel, chairman of the CSBS at the launch 
            of the report on schizophrenia that &quot;Mental health has become 
            a bit of a Cinderella&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Executive to 
            set up a mental health task force to ensure that mental health is 
            regarded as a national clinical priority by health boards in the same 
            way as it is regarded as one of only three national clinical priorities 
            by the Executive. </p>

            and hopes that it will continue to be Fife's best selling weekly for 
            many more years to come.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3007</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell: Anti-social Behaviour 
            Orders</strong>-That the Parliament believes that anti-social behaviour 
            orders are not working effectively and that many social housing providers 
            are having difficulty implementing policies and procedures to deal 
            speedily with tenants' complaints and, in order to meet the needs

            board of directors and loyal fans, for their success in securing promotion 
            to the Scottish First Division, a feat which has escaped them for 
            the last 16 years; is certain that this achievement will help to secure 
            the club's future; looks forward to further success for the club, 
            and commends the contribution made by the manager, John Connolly, 
            who has in two years transformed a football club in financial difficulty 
            and facing relegation into one which is now on the way up and which 
            also has continued ambition to go on climbing.</p>

            posed by solvent abuse; acknowledges the continued need to combat 
            solvent abuse, and believes that the Scottish Executive should investigate 
            and pilot new preventative measures such as the test purchasing scheme, 
            aimed at reducing underage sales of potentially abusive products, 
            which has been successfully applied throughout England and Wales, 
            and actively increase awareness among young people of the devastating

            and the ability to keep members fully informed in a cost effective 
            manner, the Monday Business Bulletin should be restored to its former

            concern about the situation in the Middle East; recognises the key 
            role of the United Nations and the rule of international law, and 
            affirms that the immediate cessation of violence, the recognition 
            and protection of human rights and the need for negotiation are essential 
            in order to secure just and long lasting peace in the region.</p>

            they be acts of state violence from Israel or terrorist attacks from 
            Palestine factions; calls for the immediate cessation of all acts 
            of violence; supports the codification of the Saudi initiative as 
            a UN Security Council resolution that would involve Israeli troops 
            withdrawing to pre-1967 boundaries, acceptance of the legitimacy of 
            the Israeli state by the Arab world and the establishment of a viable, 
            self-governing Palestine state; recognises that the UK should freeze 
            all military exports to Israel until it agrees to abide by UN Security 
            Council resolutions; calls for wider economic sanctions to be imposed 
            by the US and EU, preferably under the terms of a UN resolution, and 
            further recognises that the Prime Minister should resolve his contradictory 
            stance by accepting that a new UN Security Council resolution is necessary 
            before embarking on any military action in Iraq.</p>

            and the desperate need for training all professionals in diagnosis 
            and appropriate aftercare and throughcare packages; further notes 
            the increase in diagnosis, and considers the Scottish Executive should 
            implement these recommendations as soon as possible to ensure that

            with all public agencies, Stoddard International Plc, trade unions

            for the setting up of specialist courts to deal with domestic abuse; 
            notes the effectiveness of this system in dealing with the root causes 
            as well as the symptoms of domestic abuse along with programmes to 
            tackle abusive behaviour as demonstrated in Canada; further notes 
            the cluster courts set up in Leeds which have helped to speed up the 
            court process for cases involving domestic abuse and have made those 
            abused more willing to come forward due to the support they receive 
            and the clear message that is given that abuse is not acceptable, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to make the changes necessary 
            to set up these specialist courts in Scotland which will be able to 
            deal with both criminal and civil matters relating to the family.</p>

            to trade unionists the world over; notes that, every year, over 1.3 
            million workers across the world die from accidents and diseases at 
            work, nearly twice the number of deaths caused by war; further notes

            Centres in Scotland: An Independent Report </em>by Phil Taylor and 
            Christine Cooper; believes that the Scottish Executive should consider 
            seriously how this report impacts on the Scottish Prison Service estates 
            review; agrees that it is hard to believe that three new public prisons 
            would cost £700 million more to build and run than three new private

            Managed Clinical Network for Heart Disease</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises that the Dumfries and Galloway Managed Clinical Network 
            for Heart Disease was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom 
            and is a way of focusing and providing care across the boundaries 
            between general practice and hospital and between different health 
            professions with a focus on patients and their needs; notes that, 
            although the network has only been in existence for nine months, it 
            is having a tremendous impact on the quality of care provided, with 
            patients, doctors and nurses involved actively in decision-making 
            about the future of service and on the use of scarce resources; further 
            notes that the pre-hospital thrombolysis service in the area was also 
            the first of its kind in the United Kingdom and will allow life-saving 
            clot-dissolving drugs to be given to patients suffering from a heart 
            attack before they get to hospital, and congratulates all those who 
            have been involved in Dumfries and Galloway in bringing about these
