          <p><strong>*S1M-2904#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Improving Glasgow's 
            Council Homes Without a Penny of Borrowing Required</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the comments of the Minister for Social Justice 
            in relation to the wholesale stock transfer ballot in Glasgow reported 
            in the <em>Evening Times </em>on 13 March 2002; notes specifically 
            his statement that &quot;Glasgow's tenants must not miss this historic 
            opportunity to vote for warm, dry houses, rejuvenated neighbourhoods 
            and a real say in how their homes should be managed and improved. 
            It would take close to twenty years to match the level of improvements 
            that the GHA plans to undertake in ten years&quot;; further notes 
            that, in a letter of 12 March 2002, the Director of Housing Services 
            at Glasgow City Council stated that, if the housing debt burden were 
            removed from the council, it could invest £129.2 million per year 
            in modernising and improving Glasgow's council homes without a penny 
            of borrowing required; believes that it is a duty of Ministers to 
            present available information in a fair and honest fashion; accepts 
            that, if Glasgow City Council were relieved of its £900 million capital 
            debt burden, it would be able to invest £129.2 million per annum, 
            i.e. £1.3 billion over ten years without any new borrowing or additional 
            grant aid from the Scottish Executive, and considers that the Parliamentary 
            Bureau should timetable a debate on the Glasgow stock transfer issue 
            in order to allow all the information available to be discussed openly 
            and frankly. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2903#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Trade Union Rights 
            for Police Officers</strong>-That the Parliament believes that members 
            of police forces should be entitled to join a trade union of their 
            choice as a fundamental human right.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2902</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: UN Resolution 
            on State of Palestine</strong>-That the Parliament agrees with Rabbi 
            Pete Tobias in criticising the lack of humanity and purpose in the 
            bloody and brutal policies of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon 
            towards the Palestinian people; thanks him for his honesty and courage, 
            and notes the UN resolution commending the establishment of an independent 
            state of Palestine existing peacefully side-by-side with the state 
            of Israel.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2901</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Freelance Photographers 
            and The Scotsman Publications Limited</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the present dispute between freelance photographers and The 
            Scotsman Publications Limited; regrets that in an age of global media 
            The Scotsman Publications Limited and others seem determined to impose 
            unfair trading conditions on workers whose flexibility and independence 
            is a key component of success in the information market, and calls 
            upon The Scotsman Publications Limited to come to a negotiated settlement 
            in order to encourage a diverse and vibrant freelance photographic 
            sector in Scottish publishing.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2900</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Symbister and Lunnasting 
            Primary Schools</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the pupils 
            and staff of Symbister and Lunnasting Primary Schools on their success 
            this week in national competitions; notes that the success of Symbister 
            Primary School in winning the Council for the Commonwealth in Scotland 
            poster competition, and of Lunnasting Primary School in winning the 
            WWF Our World competition, demonstrate the high standard and breadth 
            of education offered by Shetland schools, and sends its best wishes 
            to the Lunnasting pupil, Stephanie Wiseman, who will represent Scotland's 
            young people at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2899</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Attack on Scottish 
            Fishermen by Struan Stevenson MEP</strong>-That the Parliament condemns 
            comments by the Chair of the European Parliament Fisheries Committee, 
            Struan Stevenson MEP, that labelled Scottish fishermen as "cheats" 
            if they accepted decommissioning grants but did not leave the fishing 
            industry; notes that the purpose of decommissioning is to reduce capacity 
            in the catching sector rather than remove individuals from the industry, 
            and further notes that having a Scot as Chair of the European Parliament 
            Fisheries Committee should be a benefit to the fishing industry in 
            Scotland rather than a liability.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2898</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: The Draft Loch Lomond 
            and the Trossachs National Park Elections (Scotland) Order 2002</strong>-That 
            the Rural Development Committee, in consideration of the draft Loch 
            Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Elections (Scotland) Order 
            2002, recommends that the Order be approved.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2897</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: The Draft

            and the Environment Committee, in consideration of the draft Bus Users 
            Complaints Tribunal Regulations 2002, recommends that the Regulations 
            be approved.</p>

            Provisions (Scotland) Order 2002</strong>-That the Rural Development 
            Committee, in consideration of the draft Loch Lomond and the Trossachs 
            National Park Designation, Transitional and Consequential Provisions 
            (Scotland) Order 2002, recommends that the Order be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2895</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: The Hollies 
            2002 Appeal</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the benefit to 
            the people of East Lothian and Musselburgh provided by the Hollies 
            Day Centre in Musselburgh; thanks the volunteers and other workers 
            who give so much time and effort to make the centre a success, and 
            encourages individuals, organisations and businesses to support the 
            2002 Appeal from the Centre which aims to raise sufficient funds to 
            construct purpose-built day care accommodation for frail and elderly 
            pensioners and run a specially adapted minibus.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2894</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Education (Disability 
            Strategies And Pupils Records) (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees that the Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils' Records) 
            (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Nicol Stephen<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Jamieson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2893</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: The Three 
            Chimneys Restaurant</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText"></a>offer 
            its warm congratulations to The Three Chimneys Restaurant, Colbost, 
            on the Isle of Skye, for being recognised by the magazine <em>Restaurant 
            </em>as one of the best places in the world to eat, coming in at number 
            28 in its world rankings; acknowledges that the outstanding success 
            of the restaurant has been achieved through a combination of traditional 
            Scottish cooking, a welcoming atmosphere, and the dedication of the 
            Spear family; notes that celebrity diners and tourists travel from 
            all over the world to sample the quality, home-made food served at 
            The Three Chimneys; recognises the significant impact that such a 
            prestigious restaurant can have on the local economy; and urges the 
            Scottish Executive, Scottish Enterprise and Visitscotland to do all 
            within their power to raise the international profile of Scotland 
            as a centre of excellence for food and drink, particularly in terms 
            of the potentially lucrative niche marketing opportunity that such 
            an image could provide.</p>
