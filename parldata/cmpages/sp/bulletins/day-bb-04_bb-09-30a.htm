          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></P>
          <p>9.30 am&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
          <p>The Clerk has been advised of the topic for the following Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Business</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate on the Centralisation of Health Services&mdash;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1784</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Centralisation of Health Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is opposed to the centralisation of health services across Scotland; notes the threat facing many local hospital services including those at Caithness General Hospital, Western Isles Hospital, Lorne and Islands District General Hospital, Belford Hospital, Inverclyde Royal Hospital, the Vale of Leven Hospital, St John&rsquo;s Hospital, Stobhill Hospital, the Victoria Infirmary, the Western Infirmary, Wishaw General Hospital, Hairmyres Hospital, Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital, Queen Mother&rsquo;s Hospital, Ayr Hospital, Perth Royal Infirmary, Forth Park Hospital, Queen Margaret Hospital, Stirling Royal Infirmary, Falkirk Royal Infirmary, Monklands Hospital and Balfour Hospital and the additional threat to many community and long-term care hospitals right across Scotland; believes that this is part of a strategy of centralising services at a handful of elite hospitals which has led to uproar from coast to coast over hospital reorganisation plans, and therefore has no confidence in the ability of the Minister for Health and Community Care to devise and implement a strategy for the NHS which serves the needs of local communities throughout Scotland. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p><strong>S2M-1784.3</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: Centralisation of Health Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1784) in the name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from &quot;is opposed&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges public concern about the extent of proposed centralisation of health services across Scotland; believes that improvement is essential to ensure that all patients have access to both high-quality specialist services and appropriate medical care delivered locally; recognises that NHS boards must pursue clinical strategies which demonstrate regional planning; notes that boundaries are irrelevant to patients; welcomes the determination of the Scottish Executive to develop the planning of healthcare services across NHS board boundaries, within the context of a national strategy; notes the work of the Parliament&rsquo;s Health Committee on this issue; welcomes the decision of the Minister for Health and Community Care to make no decision on new proposals for service change that come before him until such times as the Expert Advisory Group chaired by Professor David Kerr has reported; notes that this provides an opportunity to debate what services are best provided locally, regionally and nationally and that the presumption in the interim is that services will be maintained unless there are genuine issues of clinical safety, agreed by the Minister; affirms the Executive policy outlined in <em>Partnership for Care</em> that the patient must be at the centre of the process, and supports a patient-centred policy that acknowledges safety and quality and that also ensures that as many services as possible are provided locally.&quot; </p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-1784.2</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Centralisation of Health Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1784) in the name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from &quot;is opposed&quot; to end and insert &quot;is concerned about the centralisation of health services across Scotland; believes that there must be a clear national strategy for the future structure of the NHS in Scotland; therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to suspend all planned reorganisations while a national strategy is developed involving the public and health professionals, and calls on the Minister for Health and Community Care to issue instructions to NHS boards to put in place appropriate arrangements to retain services faced with centralisation and reinstate any that have been withdrawn without full public consultation and ministerial approval.&quot; </p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-1784.1</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Centralisation of Health Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1784) in the name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from &quot;is opposed&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the succession of profound concerns expressed in debates and motions on the NHS; further notes that these concerns are so serious that calls for a moratorium on NHS closures and centralisations have been made for over a year; notes that communities remain at odds with NHS boards and the Scottish Executive over the future of the NHS, that NHS boards implement Executive policy and budgets, notably the expensive PFI/PPP model of funding for capital projects and have no control of pharmaceutical profits, which represent a massive strain on their budgets, that the application of the working time regulations has neither been planned properly nor budgeted for, that new contracts for medical staff at all levels have not been fully funded and that numbers of graduates in all health professions have been, and are, consistently insufficient to meet the needs of patients or a 21st century NHS; believes that NHS boards should be democratically accountable for their responsibilities but that it is the Executive that sets the structural, strategic, financial and political context that they operate in and regrets the failure of the Executive to acknowledge that responsibility in relation to NHS re-organisation or engage in a debate with the public; further believes that the threat of closure of so many important facilities is entrenching the disengagement between communities and government; believes, therefore, that all reorganisation plans in the NHS should be revisited in a national context so that a wide-ranging and meaningful debate about the security and future of the NHS can take place in Scotland, involving all trade unions and professional organisations who represent NHS workers, community organisations, voluntary organisations, the public at large and academics whilst ensuring that resources and strategies are put in place to protect local services until such a debate has taken place and a national strategy is developed that has the confidence of the Scottish people, and sends its support and solidarity to all campaigners attending the demonstration called by the Scottish Health Campaigns Network in Glasgow this Saturday.&quot; </p>
