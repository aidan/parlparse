<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>A </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/index.htm"><strong>search facility</strong></a><strong> is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6955 Murdo Fraser: Congratulations to the Alyth Voice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Alyth Voice team on its 150th edition of the Alyth Voice newsletter, a free monthly newsletter distributed throughout Alyth and the immediate district that provides local information, articles, public notices and reports from the many voluntary organisations in Alyth for residents; thanks the team of volunteers who manage the newsletter and the &lsquo;Voiceteers&rsquo; who deliver it to every home in Alyth and district; notes that to mark the milestone of its 150th edition, the Alyth Voice hopes to raise funds for cancer charities and applauds everyone involved with the Alyth Voice for this noble aim; considers that the newsletter has become an important part of the Alyth community, and wishes it every success in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6954 Jack McConnell: Congratulations to Catriona Morrison</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Catriona Morrison of Scotland on her achievement in winning the women&rsquo;s event in the 2010 GE Edinburgh ITU Duathlon World Championships on Sunday 5 September; notes that this is her fourth duathlon world title, and congratulates the event organisers and the public services in Edinburgh for their exemplary organisation of the three-day world championships programme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6953 Marilyn Livingstone: Congratulations to John McGlynn</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Raith Rovers Football Club manager, John McGlynn, on being named manager of the month in the First Division after leading Raith Rovers to the top of the table; acknowledges that John received the Irn-Bru Phenomenal award after the Kirkcaldy side ended August with a 100% record following its five league and cup games, and commends the fact that John has been in charge of the club since 2006 and led them to promotion and the Second Division championship in 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6952 Robin Harper: Edinburgh Sports Facilities Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled by the proposals to close sports facilities in Edinburgh; acknowledges that local authorities have tight budgets but is of the firm belief that further reductions in the provision of such facilities could have drastic effects on obesity rates and the general health and fitness of all people; highlights what it considers to be the strong correlation between sport and health; is of the view that, if these centres were to be closed, they would be gone for good; is of the view that, if such a decision is made in order to generate a short-term saving, it could result in long-term consequences for a generation of children in Edinburgh, and believes that this would put an additional strain on NHS resources, which it believes are already stretched through coping with obesity-related health issues.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6951 Irene Oldfather: World Alzheimer&rsquo;s Day, 21 September 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses support for World Alzheimer&rsquo;s Day, Tuesday 21 September 2010; notes that the theme for this year&rsquo;s event is &quot;Dementia. It&rsquo;s time for action!&quot;, which seeks to focus on the need for governments and the general public to take any action that they can to raise awareness of dementia and improve service provision for people with dementia and their carers; recognises the efforts of charity groups to raise awareness of the need to support the estimated 30 million people who have dementia around the world; further notes that this year&rsquo;s World Alzheimer&rsquo;s Day lecture, held by Alzheimer Scotland, will focus on the challenges that hospitals represent for patients with dementiaandwill seek to identify a model of good practice for dementia care in the general hospital environment and considers that the National Dementia Strategy can play a vital role in improving general hospital care but requires to be appropriately resourced and monitored in order to be effective, and believes that a better understanding of dementia as an illness can reduce the misunderstandings and stigma that exist about the condition and work toward promoting the highest standards of health and community care, both in Scotland and elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6950 Rob Gibson: Celebrate Blas Festival 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Blas Festival 2010 for celebrating Scotland&rsquo;s Gaelic-based musical heritage in more than 30 venues from Caithness to Lochaber and Skye to Strathspey; notes the essential engagement of the local community organisers in collaborating to deliver the Highland-wide programme; celebrates the quality of homegrown, traditional musicians of all ages who deliver such a varied programme and welcomes the inclusion of Irish and Cape Breton musicians in the mix; encourages the Blas Festival to build on the multiple-venue model and on the enthusiasm of musicians and audiences, and calls on non-governmental sponsors who value Scotland&rsquo;s lively traditional culture to help ensure the life of the Blas Festival in future years, which are likely to see major cuts in central and local government funding.</p>
