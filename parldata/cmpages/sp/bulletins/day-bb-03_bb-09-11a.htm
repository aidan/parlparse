            <strong>Obesity Amongst the Scottish Population</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes with concern the findings of the recent study carried 
            out by Dr Andrew Walker of the University of Glasgow, <em>The Cost 
            of Doing Nothing - the economics of obesity in Scotland</em>; recognises 
            that an estimated 21% of adults are now obese and that the annual 
            cost to the NHS of obesity and obesity-related illnesses has been 
            estimated at £171 million; acknowledges the efforts of the Scottish 
            Executive and health care providers in attempting to address this 
            problem, in particular those of Coatbridge Local Healthcare Co-operative 
            whose &quot;Weigh-In Without Women&quot; programme recently received 
            the National Obesity Forum award for excellence in weight management, 
            and considers that such examples of best practice could be rolled 
            out across the country as part of a comprehensive multidisciplinary 
            approach to tackling this problem. </P>
