            (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-757</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Rental 
            Costs for the Assembly Hall</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament believes 
            that, in order to provide a complete picture of the transactions relating 
            to the new Parliament building, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
            Body (SPCB) should agree with the Church of Scotland to remove the 
            confidentiality clause in the agreement for the Parliament to rent 
            the Assembly Hall and make public the details of the financial arrangements 
            made both by the Scottish Office, before the Parliament existed, and 
            by the SPCB, for the extensions of the lease.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-756#</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Belford 
            Hospital, Fort William, Centre of Excellence</strong>&#8212;That the 
            Parliament supports the proposal for the Belford Hospital at Fort 
            William to become a centre of excellence for trauma training as part 
            of a medical facility within the University of the Highlands and Islands; 
            acknowledges that the Belford Hospital is already recognised nationally 
            as one of the UK&#8217;s leading hospitals in trauma treatment because 
            of its experience in dealing with mountain casualties, and further 
            recognises that this proposal would go a long way to help resolve 
            the current recruitment difficulties being experienced in some specialisms 
            of the medical profession and would give young people within the Highlands 
            and Islands the opportunity to train and live at home rather than 
            relocate to the central belt.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-755</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Pregnant 
            and Productive: An Investigation into Pregnancy Discrimination</strong>&#8212;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the first ever investigation into pregnancy 
            discrimination which has been launched by the Equal Opportunities 
            Commission (EOC); notes with concern that the EOC helpline receives 
            more calls from women facing problems at work because of pregnancy 
            than on any other subject; further expresses alarm that women have 
            been demoted, disciplined or sacked simply for having a baby; strongly 
            believes that the Scottish economy needs the skills and experience 
            of pregnant women in the workplace and women returning from maternity 
            leave, and calls on the Scottish Executive to act upon the findings 
            of the investigation to put a stop to pregnancy discrimination.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-754#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>National 
            Celebrations on St Andrew&#8217;s Day</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            believes that many aspects of Scottish life would benefit from the 
            adoption of St Andrew&#8217;s Day as a holiday and day of national 
            celebration; recognises the value that similar national days, such 
            as Thanksgiving Day in the United States of America, bring to other 
            countries, and considers that the Parliament and the Scottish Executive 
            should work with all relevant bodies to make St Andrew&#8217;s Day 
            a forum for educational, cultural and sporting activity, family reunions, 
            community events, the promotion of tourism and Scottish products abroad 
            and for developing existing celebrations of Scottish life held abroad.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-753</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The 
            Draft National Health Service (Distribution of Endowment Income Scheme) 
            (Scotland) Regulations 2004</strong>&#8212;That the Health Committee 
            recommends that the draft National Health Service (Distribution of 
            Endowment Income Scheme) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 be approved.</p>
