<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4924</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Ya Beauty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Coatbridge on being named the nation&rsquo;s Best Small City at the Beautiful Scotland Awards 2009; notes the judges&rsquo; positive view of the town following a wide-ranging tour taking in Drumpellier Country Park, Dunbeth park and Sikeside; further notes the judges&rsquo; praise of tourist attractions Sumerlee and the Time Capsule; believes that the people of Coatbridge have much to be proud of, not only in their industrial heritage but also in the ongoing commitment of local residents to improve the town&rsquo;s natural and urban heritage; believes that the whole community played a part in winning the award<font color="#0000ff">,</font> and commends North Lanarkshire Council for the continuing investment to enhance the town and its facilities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4923</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Cumbernauld, Kilsyth, Cumbernauld Village, Banton, Croy and Condorrat</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kilsyth on being named best new entry in the Community Entrant Category of the Beautiful Scotland Awards; recognises the great work carried out by the people of Kilsyth in achieving this success; further notes the wonderful achievement of Cumbernauld and Banton in gaining silver medals in the Small City and Small Village categories respectively; also praises Cumbernauld Village, Croy and Condorrat for their equally impressive success in winning Bronze Medal Certificates in the Urban Community category; hopes that this will be a catalyst to continual improvement and investment in the area; thanks all community volunteers and employees of North Lanarkshire Council who worked in partnership in the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area to achieve this success, and finally thanks the judges who travelled throughout many communities in Scotland and who recognised both the potential and the hard work carried out in the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4922</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Suicide Attempts by Female Asylum Seekers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent report by the Scottish Refugee Council and the Gender Violence Unit of the London School of Tropical Medicine on female asylum seekers that revealed that 70% had suffered physical or sexual violence, some of which they had experienced in the United Kingdom, 57% had suffered post traumatic stress disorder, a condition making it difficult to remember the details of their experiences necessary for their asylum claims to be accepted, and that 22% had attempted suicide; endorses the recommendation by the organisations that produced the report that the UK Border Agency staff and immigration judges undergo training in women&rsquo;s issues and that the Scottish Government reviews all current health and domestic violence services to ensure that they are meeting the needs of female asylum seekers, and calls on the media to report asylum issues in a balanced and responsible way.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4921</strong> <strong>Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Marine Renewables Opportunity for Caithness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent release of <em>The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan: National strategy for climate and energy</em>; regrets that this paper makes no mention of the Pentland Firth, a prime site for the development of marine energy in the United Kingdom; further notes the recent award of &pound;9.5, &pound;8 and up to &pound;10 million to marine energy development centres in Cornwall, Orkney and north-east England respectively; is concerned at this failure to recognise the important role that Caithness has in the development of renewable energy sources, and expects the Scottish Government to urge the UK Government to give the very strongest consideration to Caithness when it comes to spending the &pound;50 million Marine Renewables Deployment Fund and the &pound;22 million Marine Renewables Proving Fund.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4920</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Forth and Lanark on Beautiful Scotland Awards Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the village of Forth on winning the Jim Murdie Trophy for Sustainability and Lanark on gaining a silver medal in the 2009 Beautiful Scotland Awards; welcomes the efforts of the local communities and believes that these awards are just recognition of their hard work to improve the local environment, and notes that Beautiful Scotland is an environmental campaign in Scotland for communities who are working to improve and enhance their local area and that these awards help to encourage and celebrate the efforts of communities throughout Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4919</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to David Rintoul, Winner of the Sir William Y Darling Award for Good Citizenship</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates David Rintoul on winning the Sir William Y Darling Award for Good Citizenship and thanks him for his good work helping the community in Tollcross through the Tollcross Traders Association and Tollcross Community Council and running various local websites such as Tollcross Online.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4918</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Forth Valley Disability Sport Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the athletes of the Forth Valley Disability Sport Team, from across Clackmannanshire, Falkirk and Stirling, for their outstanding achievements at this summer&rsquo;s Special Olympics GB National Games for people with learning disabilities; notes that the 54 athletes, aged from 9 to 62 years, returned with a medal haul of 36 gold, 23 silver and 19 bronze; thanks the coaches, parents and volunteers who contributed to the success of the team, and wishes them continued success for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4917</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Gordon Brown&rsquo;s Gesture to Cut Trident Fleet</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, while welcoming any and all cuts in the levels of nuclear weapons, believes that Gordon Brown&rsquo;s unilateral gesture to cut the United Kingdom&rsquo;s fleet of Trident missile-carrying submarines is entirely to do with cost-cutting and not with a solid commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament; notes that, according to Professor Ron Smith, a defence economist at Birkbeck College, the scaling down of the number of Trident nuclear submarines from four to three is unlikely to have much effect on the UK&rsquo;s nuclear capability; believes that this move to reduce the so-called deterrent amounts to a bare minimum, especially when compared with the fresh impetus that President Obama has recently given to the international disarmament movement, and calls on the UK Government to take real and practicable steps towards full disarmament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4911.2.1</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Child Protection</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-4911.2) in the name of Adam Ingram, insert at end &quot;recognises the initiative taken by the previous administration in tackling this problem by bringing together a series of actions contained in the Hidden Harm report; calls on the Scottish Government to take effective action to identify and focus on those children who are at risk, particularly as a result of living with parents or carers who are alcohol or substance abusers; calls on the Scottish Government to report to the Parliament within three months and thereafter periodically on the progress made on this, in building on the recommendations of Hidden Harm and in the follow-up inspection work by HMIE, and looks for a child-centred approach to child protection that has the welfare and best interests of children at its heart.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4910.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Teacher Numbers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4910) in the name of Rhona Brankin, after &quot;class sizes&quot; insert &quot;; raises concern about the implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence in the face of falling teacher numbers; acknowledges that the previous administration increased the number of teachers by 4,600 between 1999 and 2007; notes the continued reduction in the number of full-time equivalent nursery teachers as shown in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Pre-school and Childcare Statistics 2009</em>&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4910.3</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Teacher Numbers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4910) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;the most recent&quot; to end and insert &quot;that Scotland benefits from a record low in average class size in primary schools, that the number of P1 to P3 pupils in classes of 18 or under is increasing and that the Scottish average primary class size is considerably smaller than those for England and Wales; welcomes the record levels of funding provided by the current administration to local government and the commitment set out in the concordat to reduce class sizes but notes that the employment of teachers is a matter for local authorities; welcomes the continuing commitment of the Scottish Government and local government to work together to make further progress on class size reduction; highlights with concern that the previous administration took no legislative action to support its class size reduction policy and notes the recently announced intention of the Scottish Government to introduce regulations for a maximum class size of 25 in P1 from the beginning of the 2010 school year and to review more generally how class sizes are governed, and also recognises the action of the Scottish Government to ensure a better balance between supply and demand of teachers.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4814.1#</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Bausch and Lomb Job losses in Livingston</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4814) in the name of Angela Constance, leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to &quot;2006&quot; and insert &quot; urges it to reconsider this decision; meanwhile, &quot;.</p>
