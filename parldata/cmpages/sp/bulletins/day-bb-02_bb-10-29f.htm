Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3510</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Kate Maclean: Royal National Institute for the Blind Campaign on Photodynamic 
Therapy Treatment</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal National 
Institute of the Blind, Scotland, on its campaign to secure the provision on the 
NHS of the effective Photodynamic Therapy Treatment (PDT) for wet Age-related 
Macular Degeneration; notes that the total cost of this treatment would be an 
estimated £2 million, equating to £6,000 per patient; further notes that the average 
cost of caring for someone who becomes blind is £10,000 per annum; rejects the 
unjustified rationing of the treatment in England and Wales proposed by the National 
Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) which would limit treatment to only the 
second affected eye and only if the second eye retains at least 6/36 acuity; further 
rejects the need to wait until the NICE appeal is completed before the treatment 
is available on the NHS in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to fund forthwith 
PDT treatment by the NHS in Scotland, and believes that it is unacceptable that 
600 elderly Scots who could benefit from the PDT treatment will otherwise unnecessarily 
go blind each year.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3509</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Richard 
Roberts Knitwear, Ayrshire</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament supports the activities 
of the trade union at Richard Roberts Knitwear (formerly Charnos) in trying to 
secure important jobs at its factory in Ayrshire and believes that a policy of 
public ownership should be applied to companies which withdraw from Scotland, 
leaving behind misery and unemployment.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3508#</STRONG> <STRONG>Fergus 
Ewing: Osteoporosis</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes that osteoporosis 
is a major public health problem which results in more than 20,000 fractures a 
year in Scotland, that the cost of osteoporotic fractures in the United Kingdom 
each year is estimated at over £1.7 billion and that one third of women and one 
in 12 men over 50 will suffer an osteoporotic fracture; further notes that with 
an ageing population profile this problem will become even more serious; is aware 
that osteoporosis is both treatable and largely preventable; welcomes the fact 
that the public and health professionals are becoming increasingly aware of osteoporosis 
as a major health problem but is concerned that health service provision throughout 
Scotland is patchy and that access to diagnostic testing and monitoring varies 
around the country; believes that sufficient funding can be made available so 
that all patients have equal access to services for both the diagnosis and treatment 
of osteoporosis and that all patients suffering a fragility fracture or having 
other risk factors for the disease should be assessed for the presence of osteoporosis, 
and further believes that public health campaigns should be promoting the importance 
of lifestyle factors as influencing bone health and preventing osteoporosis. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3507</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Michael Russell: Broadcasting and the Media</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
recognises the vital importance of broadcasting and the print media to the cultural, 
social and economic life of Scotland and expresses its concern that the present 
devolution settlement prevents it from legislating in order to secure diversity 
of ownership and appropriate modern broadcasting regulation in Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3506</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Hairmyres Hospital Ancillary Staff</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">deplores the low level of wages across the 
National Health Service in Scotland; supports the action of ancillary staff at 
Hairmyres Hospital who will be striking to secure £5 per hour, which in itself 
still constitutes a low wage, and offers its fullest possible solidarity with 
the striking Hairmyres Hospital workers.</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3505 UNISON Campaign
