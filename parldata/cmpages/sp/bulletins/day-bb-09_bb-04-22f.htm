<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3948</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 2014 Legacy Plan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming meeting to take place in Glasgow between the Minister for Public Health and Sport, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Andy Burnham, Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy and Glasgow City Council leader Steven Purcell to discuss the release of a substantial sum of National Lottery funding towards supporting a legacy for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow; supports the work of the Scottish Government and its partners, including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Glasgow City Council, local authorities across Scotland, NHS boards, public bodies and the third sector, in planning for a legacy for the people of Scotland from these Games; agrees that the Interim Games Legacy Plan, published on 18 December 2008, set the right context for that planning with its emphasis on health, physical activity and sport and its coverage of volunteering, education and learning, culture, sustainability, business, skills, tourism and Scotland&rsquo;s international profile; commends the real opportunity that the hosting of the Games offers for regenerating the east end of Glasgow, and further agrees that, following the launch of the full Games Legacy Plan in the summer, the Scottish Parliament can play a part by encouraging individuals, groups, communities and businesses to get involved so that Scotland&rsquo;s legacy from the 2014 Games can be lasting and positive.</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3947</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Scottish Newspaper Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the threat to the Scottish economy from the current crisis facing Scotland&rsquo;s newspaper and media industries; notes that local newspapers are facing particular difficulties in the current economic climate; opposes any moves towards compulsory redundancies such as those imposed by Trinity Mirror at the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail</em>; calls for all newspaper and media organisations considering restructuring, reorganisation or redundancy to engage in meaningful negotiations with the relevant workforce representatives in order to minimise the economic impact of any job cuts, and calls on the Scottish Government to hold urgent talks with Trinity Mirror management in order to prevent compulsory job cuts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3946</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Roslin Institute Scientific Research</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the University of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Roslin Institute for its role in scientific research into gene interaction, providing a crucial resource for the study of immunity and disease and a better understanding of why different people can develop a disease in different ways; considers that the research could lead to treatments for diseases such as cancer, arthritis and MS by identifying the weak spots in the gene network and provide clues on how to stop the growth of tumours or enable the growth of healthy cells, and notes that the project, led by Professor David Hume, Director of the Roslin Institute, is an international study involving scientists from the Roslin Institute and a number of other research centres and universities worldwide and is yet another scientific achievement of which Scotland is proud to be part.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3945</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>EU Structural Funds</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &pound;95 million in European Structural Funds that will be injected into the Scottish economy, financing a total of 129 projects across many areas of the country; notes that the &pound;70.2 million allocated from the European Regional Development Fund will focus on urban regeneration, business growth and rural development, creating almost 8,000 jobs, and that the &pound;24.7 million allocated from the European Social Fund will target unemployment by supporting around 75,000 people through training and skills development; further notes that this cash will provide a fundamental boost to some of Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived areas, creating opportunities for people and businesses; stresses the benefits and importance of European Structural Funds to Scotland particularly during the current economic recession, and recognises that these funds constitute one of many advantages of EU membership.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3940</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Gordon and MacPhail, Winners of the Queen&rsquo;s Award for Enterprise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates whisky specialist Gordon and MacPhail, a family-owned business employing 130 people in Elgin and Forres, for winning the prestigious Queen&rsquo;s Award for Enterprise: International Trade 2009 following a 94% increase in the value of its total exports over the last five years; considers that this award is recognised around the world and will be used by the company to increase its global reputation in the coming years, and congratulates Gordon and MacPhail for the work that it has done to enhance the reputation of Moray as the whisky capital of the United Kingdom, stocking around 300 different brands of whisky, including Benromach Organic, the world&rsquo;s first bottled single malt to be fully certified by the Soil Association.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3939</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Miners&rsquo; Knee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that thousands of miners suffer from a form of osteoarthritis of the knee, also known as miners&rsquo; knee; further notes the recommendation of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council that coal miners with the condition who have worked underground for 10 years or more should be able to claim Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit; welcomes the recent announcement by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions that miners&rsquo; knee will now be added to the list of prescribed diseases, ensuring that former miners will now be able to apply for state compensation through Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit; believes that this is a fitting announcement in the 25th anniversary year of the miners&rsquo; strike; recognises the work that has been carried out over the years by the National Union of Mineworkers to improve the rights and welfare of miners and former miners, and hopes that members of the Scottish Parliament will work with the National Union of Mineworkers in Scotland for the benefit of all miners, former miners, mining families and mining communities across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3938</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>West of Scotland Transport Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the need for investment in transport infrastructure in the west of Scotland, particularly in the Greater Glasgow travel-to-work area, to ensure the continued competitiveness of the area, especially given that Glasgow and surrounding areas linked with traditional manufacturing and heavy industry, which suffered badly in previous recessions, are experiencing disproportionate increases in unemployment compared with the Scottish average, as illustrated by claimant count statistics.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3937</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Ballet, Life Begins at 40</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2009 is the 40th anniversary of the founding of Scottish Ballet by Peter Darrell; recognises that the company has begun its anniversary year in typically innovative style by commissioning the new ballet, Carmen, from choreographer Richard Alston, cementing a new partnership with the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and increasing its outreach and education programme; wishes the company every success in its anniversary year, and hopes that its new home, the Tramway, will allow it to build on its many achievements.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3936</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Welcome Help for Malawi&rsquo;s Mums</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement by Secretary of State for International Development Douglas Alexander MP, of a &pound;9 million increase in the Department for International Development&rsquo;s health programme in Malawi; welcomes the fact that this money will be used to tackle problems suffered by women after complications during pregnancy and childbirth, and expresses the hope that maternal mortality rates in Malawi will decrease as a result of this investment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3935</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Gordon and MacPhail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Elgin-based and family-owned firm, Gordon and MacPhail, on winning a prestigious Queen&rsquo;s Award for Enterprise: International Trade 2009, following a 94% increase in the value of its total exports over the last five years; notes that this local company, which began in 1895, employs 130 people in Elgin and Forres, stocks around 300 different whisky brands and currently exports around 60% of all its bottled products; further notes that the company has recently expanded its export department and plans to boost international sales, which last year amounted to around &pound;3.6 million across 50 different markets; recognises the dedication and hard work of all the staff who have worked to make the company one of Scotland&rsquo;s leading independent whisky specialists, and wishes Gordon and MacPhail every success for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3934</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Largs Youth Theatre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Largs Youth Theatre (LYT) on being chosen to perform Blackout, a short play by Glasgow writer Davey Anderson, at the Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh on 10 June 2009 as part of the National Theatre New Connections Regional Festival; notes that LYT is one of nine Scottish youth companies performing new plays for and about young people by some of Scotland&rsquo;s best contemporary playwrights as part of the New Connections programme; is aware that LYT, founded in 2002, has almost 200 students ranging in age from three to 19 and strongly supported by enthusiastic local volunteers from the wider Largs community; recognises the hard work and dedication of the young students who will participate in Blackout, the leadership and commitment provided by the directors of LYT, Andrew McGregor and Marianne Yeomans, and wishes everyone connected with LYT continued success in the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3933&diams;</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Private Residential Care Home Accountability</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vital support for vulnerable elderly people provided through well managed care homes in Scotland; notes the increase in the number of privately managed and financed residential care homes in the Scottish Borders and further notes the role of the Care Commission in ensuring that all care homes in the public and private sector are delivering a high standard of care; also notes that financial mismanagement of private sector homes operations has caused worrying disruption in care but considers that there are very limited statutory powers for the Care Commission and local authorities to scrutinise the financial capability and security of private care homes operations, and believes that it would be beneficial for there to be more regular financial accountability as there is for the standard of care.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3932</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Susan Boyle Shows West Lothian&rsquo;s Got Talent</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Susan Boyle of Blackburn, West Lothian, on her show-stopping performance of I Dreamed A Dream from Les Miserables on the ITV show, Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent; notes that Susan&rsquo;s fabulous performance has now had a reported 50 million viewings on YouTube and has raised global interest with Susan&rsquo;s performance being played on television around the world, including in the United States of America on NBC&rsquo;s Today Show and with an interview with Larry King on CNN&rsquo;s Larry King Live, and attracting support from Hollywood stars Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore; commends Susan for her lifelong devotion to her family, church and singing; recognises that Susan is an example to all of what ordinary people can do when they are given the chance; welcomes the fantastic support that Susan has received from her family and friends, the community of Blackburn and all those who have helped to develop and encourage her extraordinary talents; wishes Susan every success in the coming rounds of Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent; encourages all of Scotland to show support for Susan, and looks forward to her future as a singing sensation.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3931</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow&rsquo;s MOBO</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Glasgow will host the prestigious Music of Black Origin (MOBO) awards, the first time that the iconic awards ceremony has been held outside London in its illustrious 13-year history; applauds the efforts of EventScotland and Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, along with support from the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise, in securing the event, and believes that Glasgow&rsquo;s renowned status as a UNESCO City of Music and world-class venue will be further enhanced by the MOBO awards.</p>
