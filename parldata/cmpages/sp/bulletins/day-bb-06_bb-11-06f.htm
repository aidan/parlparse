<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<P><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<P><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<P><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<P><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<P><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<P><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<P><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<P><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<P><strong>*S2M-5094</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>30 Years of Oil Exploration and Production in the North Sea</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 30th anniversary of the first oil being taken from the North Sea; welcomes the contribution that the oil and gas sector has made to the economy of the north east of Scotland and in making Aberdeen the oil capital of Europe; further notes the challenges facing the sector as it builds on this experience and looks to the future, diversifying and developing new markets in renewable energy to enable Aberdeen to become the energy capital of the world, and recognises that the sector has many future years of development which will require more young people to acquire skills to enjoy a productive future in the industry and Scottish universities and colleges to provide the required education and training, suitably supported by the Scottish Executive.</p>
<P><strong>*S2M-5093</strong> <strong>Iain Smith on behalf of the Education Committee:</strong> <strong>Draft National Plan for Gaelic</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the contents of the Education Committee&rsquo;s 11th Report, 2006 (Session 2): <em>Draft National Plan for Gaelic </em>(SP Paper 657).</p>
<P><strong>*S2M-5092</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>European Football Championships</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that holding major sporting events, such as the European Football Championships, in Scotland brings enormous benefits, including the opportunity to promote Scotland on the world stage; recognises that these benefits would be accompanied by the opportunity to enhance the Scottish tourist industry and to promote sport and healthy living to the next generation; acknowledges that for such a bid to be successful it must involve the combined effort of the Scottish government, the Scottish football authorities and the public and private sectors, all working together to secure the tournament for Scotland, and urges the Scottish government to throw its weight behind a Scotland-only bid for the European Football Championships.</p>
<P>Supported by: Shona Robison<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<P> <strong>*S2M-5091</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Polish Right to Free, Safe Abortion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the current proposals to change the constitution of the Republic of Poland, with the result that abortion will become illegal in almost every situation; notes that this ban, if it goes ahead, will be in violation of the rights of women to planned parenthood and is at variance with human rights and European standards; recognises that any ban on abortion is essentially ineffective as independent research indicates that the number of illegal abortions is anything from 80,000 to 200,000; further notes that backstreet abortions in Poland are big business and that abortion is available for 2,000 to 3,000 zlotys (347 to 520 pounds sterling) in private surgeries while the tablet RU-486 is also available on the black market; further notes that both are outwith the income of many ordinary women; acknowledges that the increasing number of cases of abandoned babies is clearly a result of the law which forces women to give birth, who for personal or economic reasons cannot decide to have a child; congratulates the people of Poland who are standing up to oppose this change, and calls on the Scottish Executive to also offer messages of support to the demonstrators and to urge the Polish government to respect the rights of women to free, safe abortion.</p>

<P> <strong>*S2M-5090</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Prisons Shame</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland that reveals that 24 under 16-year-olds spent time in adult prisons last year and that this is an increase of six from 2004-05; notes that all of the children held in prison were boys and the youngest was only 14 years and three months; further notes that the Chief Inspector has listed nine evils of prison overcrowding including staff having less time to screen violent and potentially suicidal prisoners, drugs being more readily available, the greater likelihood of cell sharing with dangerous inmates, noise and tension being increased, contact between prisoners and staff being reduced, inmates having less access to education and rehabilitation services, facilities being stretched and food quality suffering, more time being spent isolated in cells and family visits and contact being restricted; recognises that all of these evils can exacerbate stress levels for all prisoners and can particularly exacerbate stress for young prisoners; notes further that the emotional needs of young offenders are different to those of the adult prison population and that incarceration of young prisoners in adult establishments is detrimental to the emotional well-being of young offenders and does nothing to help them rehabilitate and address their offending behaviour, and calls on the Scottish Executive to call an immediate halt to the practice of sending young offenders to adult prison and to address the causes of offending among young people.</p>
<P><strong>*S2M-5089</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Rules Governing Members&rsquo; Expenses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament requests that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should commission an independent review of the rules governing members&rsquo; expenses.</p>

<P><strong>S2M-5083</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Adam Smith to Feature on English Banknotes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to note that the Bank of England is to feature a portrait of 18th century Scottish philosopher, Adam Smith, on its new &pound;20 note; notes that Smith was one of the first to argue the case for a free market economy and that his views are as relevant today as they were during his lifetime; further notes that Smith is the first Scot to be honoured in this way, and welcomes this as an acknowledgement that the United Kingdom as a whole has benefited immensely from a strong political and economic union.</p>
<P><strong>S2M-5082</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Lost Children Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that it is 30 years since three-year-old Sandy Davidson disappeared from his home in Bourtreehill, Irvine; notes that it is estimated that a child disappears in the United Kingdom every five minutes, equating to approximately 100,000 children every year and that, according to campaign groups, speed is critical in locating missing children; congratulates Sandy&rsquo;s sister, Donna Davidson, on the launch of her nationwide campaign to help track down the thousands of children who disappear every year in this country; notes that the campaign will involve displaying posters of missing children on 450 vans across the country, and calls on local authorities across the country to aid this campaign in every way possible.</p>

<P> <strong>S2M-5080<> </strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>WHSmith and Scottish Publishing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the huge contribution made by literature and the wider publishing industry to Scottish culture and the Scottish economy; notes that the cultural and economic benefits which they provide are particularly important for the capital city, Edinburgh, UNESCO World City of Literature; condemns, therefore, the overly centralised buying system operated by high street bookstore WHSmith from its Swindon headquarters; notes that the company&rsquo;s buying policies result in very few Scottish titles finding their way on to WHSmith shelves; recognises that, as WHSmith has a 20% share of the Scottish consumer book market, its policy of directing all book-buying from outside Scotland has a detrimental effect on Scottish writers, the Scottish publishing industry and the Scottish book-buying public; considers that the Scottish Executive should set up a group to look at the question of asymmetric trading relationships, that is large companies declining to trade with small producers, a relatively common occurrence in Scotland, and further believes that the Executive should draw up a Scottish book retailers code of conduct which ensures that the buying systems of booksellers in this country take into account the distinctive culture and heritage of Scotland and its localities.</p>

<P><strong>S2M-5078</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>North Sea Divers&rsquo; Strike</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of 500 deep sea divers in the Rail Maritime and Transport union (RMT) to reject by more than two-to-one the latest United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association pay offer; recognises the extremely dangerous conditions in which these men work, deep in the icy waters of the North Sea, putting their lives at risk to repair oil wells and pipelines in an industry vital to Scotland&rsquo;s economy; believes that it is right that their wages should reflect the great danger of the job; recognises the fact that they must pay out &pound;20,000 for their extensive training; further notes that they can spend half their working week in decompression chambers after working at depths of 600 feet, that they face compulsory retirement at 50 and cannot get life insurance, medical or sickness cover for the extremely hazardous job they do; believes that the &pound;46,000 maximum salary is therefore not excessive, being much less than the salary earned by an MSP, for example, and notes that divers&rsquo; pay has slipped by 20% in recent years in comparison with similar occupations; believes that while the oil industry is making record breaking super-profits it is only right that the highly important and dangerous job these divers do is fully recognised, and calls on the United Kingdom Offshore Operators Association to meet RMT representatives at the earliest opportunity to try to settle this dispute to the satisfaction of both sides.</p>

<P> <strong>S2M-5075</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Threat to Less Favoured Area Support for Scottish Farmers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with considerable concern that the Scottish Executive cannot submit its Rural Development Plan (RDP) for 2007 to 2013 until agreement is reached between EU member states on the mechanism for administering voluntary modulation, the top slicing of farmers&rsquo; support payments to fund other schemes; further notes that, as the United Kingdom is the only member state wishing to implement voluntary modulation, agreement is unlikely to be reached in the foreseeable future; considers it unacceptable that payment of the &pound;61 million of Less Favoured Area (LFA) support normally received by those Scottish farmers who make their living in the 85% of Scotland that is designated as &quot;less favoured&quot; cannot be paid until the RDP is submitted and agreed; further considers that the solution proposed by the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to make an interim payment of &pound;10 million in the spring of 2007, with a full LFA support scheme payment in the autumn of 2007, will effectively bring about a reduction of &pound;51 million in agricultural support during the 2006-07 financial year, and therefore calls on the Executive urgently to consider submitting a limited RDP leaving the subject of voluntary modulation to be agreed at a later date, thereby allowing existing schemes to be fully funded and LFA support to be paid in the spring when it is of critical importance to the farmers who receive it.</p>

<P><strong>S2M-5070</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Citizens Advice Direct</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the essential work of Citizens Advice Direct, now approaching its second anniversary providing a helpline of particular use to those who are unable to access their local Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) for a variety of reasons, such as lack of mobility, being housebound, unaffordable transport or childcare costs or because they work during traditional CAB opening hours; notes that more than 85% of client inquiries are resolved by this service in the initial contact while more complex issues are referred to the CABx or other advice services and that, to date, some 20,000 clients have had their issues resolved; further notes that Citizens Advice Direct provides advice on best practice to other organisations using helplines, and urges the Scottish government to support this service through appropriate funding.</p>

<P> <strong>S2M-5068</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Justice for the Kurdish People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Cypriot government to deport Kurds living in Cyprus to Syria; notes that these Kurds played an instrumental role in the refugee protests in Cyprus last May; further notes that the Kurds who participated in the protest successfully gained their legal rights as asylum seekers through this struggle, were given medical cards and valid residence permits, temporary housing for all in need, an emergency lump sum of money and work permits complying with existing collective agreements; recognises that the Kurdish people are an oppressed nation, that their territory is occupied by Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria, all of which refuse to recognise the Kurds as a nation, that they are denied their national rights, such as being taught and participating in public life using their own language, that they also face general forms of discrimination and that they are refused access to high schools and universities and experience difficulties finding employment and receiving ID papers and passports; further notes that the Syrian government is extremely repressive of Kurdish protests against their own oppression, that many of the 100 Kurdish refugees in Cyprus who participated in the May protests were also activists in Syria and are wanted by that government and that during the May demonstrations the families of those who participated were visited by the Syrian secret police to be informed that the authorities knew about the activities of their family members in Cyprus; expresses its complete opposition to the Cypriot government&rsquo;s present treatment of the Kurdish refugees, and calls on the Cypriot government to offer asylum and a policy of tolerance and hospitality to the Kurdish refugees.</p>

<P><strong>S2M-5033</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Her Majesty the Queen Praises Independence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes comments made by Her Majesty the Queen on a recent visit to Estonia where she praised Estonia&rsquo;s struggle for independence, stating &quot;Estonia&rsquo;s development since regaining its independence has been remarkable. Your entrepreneurial spirit, your innovative use of information and communication technology, and your open and transparent economic climate has resulted in dramatic growth, led by international trade and investment ... It is that indomitable spirit, which was able to keep alive the flame of independence, despite all attempts to extinguish it, during the very worst of times. It is this spirit which has driven forward the rapid political, economic and social change in all your countries, change which is not something to be measured simply by statistics, but in the freedom, peace and prosperity which all your peoples now enjoy&quot;; notes that the successful example of Estonia and subsequent comments from Her Majesty mirror the historic and current situation in Scotland, while expounding the many benefits independence brings, and hopes to receive similar praise from Her Majesty in the near future.</p>

<P><strong>S2M-5032</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Climate Change - An Economic Issue</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes today&rsquo;s publication by Sir Nicholas Stern, Head of the UK Government economic service and former World Bank chief economist, of his report into the economics of climate change and congratulates all those involved in the production of the report; notes the report&rsquo;s finding that it will cost around 1% of global GDP to take early and effective action to tackle the causes of climate change while doing nothing could cost up to 20 times that amount; acknowledges Sir Nicholas&rsquo; warning that climate change, if nothing is done to address the problem, could cause a world recession comparable to the Wall Street crash and the Great Depression, with the world&rsquo;s poorest countries hit hardest and earliest; rejects as grossly misleading the notion that society must choose between a healthy environment on one hand and a healthy economy on the other and believes, instead, that in order for any kind of economic stability to exist, a stable environment is a fundamental prerequisite, and fervently hopes that the publication of this report will constitute a watershed moment in global political and public opinion, leading to a new willingness among politicians, of all complexions, to place action on climate change at the top of the political agenda, replacing the blinkered and dangerous fixation on economic growth.</p>
