<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the<a href="#end"> end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6645 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Committee Membership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr Frank McAveety be appointed to replace Rhona Brankin as a member of the European and External Relations Committee;</p>
<p>Mr Frank McAveety be appointed to replace Cathie Craigie as a member of the Public Audit Committee;</p>
<p>Cathie Craigie be appointed to replace Mr Frank McAveety as a member of the Public Petitions Committee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6644 Bill Kidd: The UK Budget and the Future of Disability Living Allowance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has stated in his budget speech that a new medical assessment for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) will be introduced from 2013 and will be applied to new and existing claimants; notes that this appears to be adopting a model similar to that of Employment and Support Allowance, and further expresses concern that this new test will be introduced with the express intention of reducing the number of people eligible for DLA rather than being based on the principle of fairness.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6643 Willie Coffey: Privatisation of Air Traffic Control</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the intention of the UK Government to fully privatise the National Air Traffic Control Service (NATS); notes that this is the continuation of a policy pursued by thelast administration led by Labour, which transferred 51% of NATS to the private sector in 2001; believes that the provision of the core activity of NATS, civilian air traffic control, should be excluded from full privatisation, and offers its appreciation of the commitment and dedication of the workforce of 900 at the enlarged Prestwick Air Traffic Control Centre, which deals with 900,000 flights per annum over Scotland, Northern Ireland, the north of England and the North Atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6642 Sarah Boyack: Broadcasting Black Hole for Scottish Rugby</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Scotland&rsquo;s commendable performance during the Six Nations tournament with a notable away win in Ireland; is disappointed that terrestrial broadcasters do not cover a broader range of rugby matches and tournaments at all playing levels; believes that more investment in the coverage of Scottish rugby is essential in order to promote sport in general to a wider audience, thereby increasing participation and health levels and to showcase the successes of Scotland&rsquo;s rugby teams; notes the substantial contribution that rugby matches bring to the local Edinburgh economy, and would welcome efforts to ensure increased broadcast coverage of rugby in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6641 Bill Butler: Co-operatives Fortnight</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 19 June to 3 July 2010 marks the first ever Co-operatives Fortnight, which will see 14 days of events, workshops and activities aimed at promoting co-operative models and values across the country; acknowledges the estimated &pound;3 billion that co-operatives contribute to the Scottish economy; welcomes the decision of the United Nations to recognise the major role that co-operatives play in society by designating 2012 International Year of Cooperatives; considers that Scotland is of huge significance to the co-operative movement, given the international significance of the Fenwick Weavers and the UNESCO World Heritage site at New Lanark, and encourages the Scottish Government, local authorities, communities, schools and individuals to participate in both this year&rsquo;s Co-operatives Fortnight and the UN International Year of the Cooperatives in 2012.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6640 Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell: International Status for Scottish Human Rights Commission</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on its recent accreditation with grade A status by the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights; welcomes the fact that this accreditation allows the SHRC to report directly to the United Nations on human rights issues such as the rights of older people, health, business, climate change and human rights; further notes that the SHRC will also make contributions to the Human Rights Council and will work with other independent commissions from around the world; notes that this accreditation marks Scotland as one of only 67 countries recognised as having a national human rights institution that complies fully with the UN Paris Principles, and commends the work of the SHRC in keeping Scotland to the forefront of human rights in the world community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6639 Nanette Milne: Scottish Rugby Historic Series Win against Argentina</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish rugby union team on its historic series win against Argentina; notes the excellent work with Asthma UK Scotland of two of the key players, captain Alastair Kellock and stand-off Dan Parks, and hopes that their high profile will be an inspiration to the 72,000 children with asthma in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6638 Peter Peacock: Illegal Killing of Birds of Prey</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that birds of prey are important indicators of the health of the environment and that, despite best efforts, many of Scotland&rsquo;s native species of bird of prey have an unfavourable conservation status, often due to illegal killing; considers that the prevalence of this criminality is most obvious in upland areas, particularly in some areas managed for driven grouse shooting in the southern uplands and central and eastern Highlands; welcomes the steps taken by PAWS and recent environment ministers to address the problem of illegal killing of birds of prey; welcomes recent statements by landowning bodies condemning illegal poisoning but hopes that this will be translated into positive action on the ground and demonstrable improvements in the range and breeding success of key bird of prey species; expresses concern at any prospect of licensed control of birds of prey to protect reared pheasants or other gamebirds; applauds the work of the Langholm Moor Demonstration Project as a constructive approach; understands that any move toward licensed control of birds of prey would make Scotland the only country in Europe to routinely sanction such action, sending out mixed messages to land managers about the obligation to conserve some of our most threatened species, and expresses concern that this would have implications for Scotland&rsquo;s international reputation and for important sectors, such as tourism.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6636.1 John Lamont: The Independent Review of Sheriff and Jury Procedure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6636) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, insert at end &quot;, and further recognises that, with constraints on the public expenditure, it is vital to ensure that justice continues to be delivered swiftly and in a cost effective manner.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6636.2 Robert Brown: The Independent Review of Sheriff and Jury Procedure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6636) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, insert at end &quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the courts and other stakeholders to implement the reforms as a matter of urgency.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6635.1 Jim Mather: Tourism</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6635) in the name of Iain Smith, leave out from &quot;deeply regrets&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the initiative of the industry to establish the Tourism Leadership Group as a positive step in working collaboratively toward growth and prosperity, and notes that extending the small business bonus scheme will mean that half of all businesses, including many tourism-related businesses, will receive a discounted bill this year and well over a quarter of business properties will pay no rates at all and that the introduction of a transitional relief scheme would increase taxes for small and medium-sized private companies by &pound;77 million, meaning that eight out of 10 ratepayers, including many in the tourism and hospitality industry, would be worse or no better off, which would be extremely damaging for Scotland in this period of fragile economic recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-6635.1.1 Gavin Brown: Tourism</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-6635.1) in the name of Jim Mather, insert at end &quot;, and welcomes the UK Government&rsquo;s decision not to repeal the special tax rules for furnished holiday lettings, as had been proposed by the previous administration led by Labour.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6635.2 Lewis Macdonald: Tourism</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6635) in the name of Iain Smith, insert at end &quot;; regrets that the combination of increased business rates and increased VAT will put Scotland&rsquo;s tourism industry at a competitive disadvantage, and believes therefore that there is even greater need for the Scottish Government to adopt an approach based on greater transparency and accountability, learning the lessons of the Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the Gathering as well as other recent events, and to give renewed emphasis to training and skills&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6633.1 Shona Robison: Free Personal Care for the Elderly</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6633) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;, and welcomes the wide-ranging Reshaping Care for Older People programme, which is developing innovative and practical ideas for change to meet the needs of Scotland&rsquo;s population that are sustainable, deliverable and fair.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-6633.2 Murdo Fraser: Free Personal Care for the Elderly</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6633) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;; urges the Scottish Government to continue to identify savings in administrative costs that can be reinvested in frontline services, and, in this context, calls on the Scottish Government to give serious consideration to the proposal from Lord Sutherland to merge health and social care budgets.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6591.1# Bill Kidd: Independent Living in Scotland Magazine, Rights Here Rights Now</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6591) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end &quot;, but considers with regret that the previous UK administration led by Labour set back the interests of the independent living movement by its proposed changes to the Independent Living Fund (ILF) criteria that would restrict new applications to those disabled people who are in paid employment of 16 hours or more and that this could massively reduce the number of new people eligible for the ILF, which assists disabled people to access essential support.&quot;</p>
