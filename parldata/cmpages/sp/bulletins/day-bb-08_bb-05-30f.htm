<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2024</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>The Labour Party&rsquo;s Cash Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the serious financial difficulties facing the Labour Party, which has five weeks to find over &pound;7 million pounds to pay off outstanding loans or face the possibility of the Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP and other senior officials becoming personally liable and subsequently facing possible bankruptcy; believes that the scale of continuing financial mismanagement within the Labour Party raises serious concerns over its ability to control the finances of the United Kingdom, and further believes, that given that according to Labour sources &quot;the party&rsquo;s constitution is like a five-a-side football club&quot;, it is of little wonder that so few voters now trust the UK Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2023</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>The Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland Revocation Regulations 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland Revocation Regulations 2008 (SSI 2008/187).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2022</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>The Public Transport Users&rsquo; Committee for Scotland Amendment Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Public Transport Users&rsquo; Committee for Scotland Amendment Order 2008 (SSI 2008/186).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2021#</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Best Value Audit of Aberdeen City Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the findings and recommendations of the Accounts Commission for Scotland following its Best Value audit of Aberdeen City Council and looks forward to concerted and urgent action to implement those recommendations and to secure the future of schools and of public and voluntary sector services in the city.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2020</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>HBOS/Barnardo&rsquo;s Tug of War</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the fourth annual HBOS/Barnardo&rsquo;s Tug of War Competition will take place on Wednesday 18 June 2008 in Holyrood Park, Edinburgh; recognises that last year&rsquo;s event helped raise over &pound;4,500 for Barnardo&rsquo;s to use for its excellent charity work, and calls on all challengers to take their chances against the reigning three-time champions, the Scottish Conservatives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2019</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Open University and Part-Time Students</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the 1,000 people from across Scotland who will receive Open University degrees and professional qualifications this year; notes that they come from all educational backgrounds, from the widest age range, and that most have had to fund their studies themselves; recognises that studying part-time has given them the flexibility they needed to be able to engage with higher education in a way that fits around their work and domestic commitments, without compromising their income and job security, and further notes the important contribution that part-time students make to improving Scotland&rsquo;s skills base and economic development.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2018</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Public Health Etc. (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Public Health etc. (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2017</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>London-Venezuela Oil Agreement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of the newly-elected Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, to scrap the city&rsquo;s deal with Venezuela which has provided oil at a price that benefited people living in poverty in both Venezuela and London; notes the success of other bilateral schemes between Venezuela and Boston and New York, and believes that Venezuela&rsquo;s sensible and innovative management of its oil resources is a positive example for other countries endowed with such natural resources.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2016</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Postcode Lottery for Sufferers of DMD</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that people who suffer from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe and progressive genetic muscle-wasting disease predominantly affecting boys and for which there is currently no cure, are dying in Scotland years earlier then their counterparts in England; believes that an improvement in the life expectancy and experiences of these young people must be a priority for the Scottish Government; considers that currently the care and management of the disease in Scotland is very much a postcode lottery as are the grants available for housing adaptations; notes that in the rest of the United Kingdom families with disabled children get &pound;30,000 grants to adapt their homes, which are not means tested; calls for similar measures to be introduced in Scotland alongside enhanced medical research and better support services and equipment; recognises that the implementation of such measures can make a massive difference to the quality of life of people with DMD and can contribute to extending their life expectancy; welcomes the calls from Action Duchenne for a centre of excellence to be set up in Glasgow that will bring standards of care and treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy up to those seen in centres of excellence in Newcastle and London, and calls for funding and support from the Scottish Government to deliver this centre of neuromuscular excellence to provide services across Scotland, thus ensuring best practice and dispersing standards of care into local clinics throughout Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2014#</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Rosyth to Zeebrugge Ferry Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply disappointed to learn of Superfast Ferries&rsquo; decision to end sailings from Rosyth to Zeebrugge from September 2008; recognises that the ferry link to Europe is vital to the Fife and Scottish economies; notes that the service has been a commercial success regularly operating at full capacity; is disappointed that Superfast does not plan to continue with sailings until an alternative operator is found, and hopes that an alternative operator can be found for this crucial ferry route.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2013</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>UNISON Survey of Members at Leverndale Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the UNISON survey of members at Leverndale Hospital; express concern that amongst other results, 35% of staff who responded advised that they had been referred to or sought advice from occupational services or other services as a result of being bullied or stress at work; welcomes the agreement of the management and UNISON to address these issues through partnership working, and invites the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to monitor progress with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2012</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Effect of Fuel Prices on Mileage Rates for NHS Staff</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the effect that rising fuel prices are having on low-income groups dependent on driving for work; in particular, notes that NHS district nurses are often required to travel for work purposes and yet NHS mileage rates, which are set at a UK level, have not changed since 2002; believes that fair reimbursement of work-related expenses is a necessity especially for low-income groups, and supports the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in its negotiations with NHS employers across the United Kingdom to find a suitable solution that realistically reflects the nature of changing fuel prices and their impact on RCN members.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2011&diams;</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Enforcement of Planning Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the difficulties faced by planning authorities, such as Fife Council, in attempting to deal with breaches of planning legislation through enforcement and stop notices; considers that development without the appropriate planning approval undermines the rule of law and the planning process and that the present planning legislation does not provide a sufficient safeguard against unlawful development; believes that appeals against enforcement or stop notices should not be permitted on the grounds that planning permission for the development would have been granted or that a planning application for the development has been submitted; further believes that there should be a presumption against approval for any development that has been carried out without the appropriate planning approvals, and desires further debate on these proposals.</p>
