<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-64#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>The Economy of the Far North</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the very real challenges presented to the north Highland economy by accelerated decommissioning at Dounreay and also notes that there is potential for using the north Highland skills pool to develop new industries, particularly in renewables and research fields, and that, accordingly, Caithness would make a most suitable location for the Energy Technology Institute being considered by the UK Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-63#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Implementation of the Glasgow Crossrail Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the national and local economic and transport benefits of the proposed Glasgow Crossrail scheme; accepts the added value that the proposed crossrail scheme would bring not only to Glasgow but to Scotland&rsquo;s rail transport infrastructure; acknowledges that the establishment of the scheme would bridge the missing link in Scotland&rsquo;s rail network; realises that the scheme would further strengthen Glasgow&rsquo;s bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and believes that the compelling economic and transport case for Glasgow Crossrail is such that the Scottish Executive should commit to the implementation of the project at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-62</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Suspension of Standing Orders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Rule 5.6.1(c) of Standing Orders be suspended for the purposes of Members&rsquo; Business on Wednesday 23, Thursday 24, Wednesday 30 and Thursday 31 May 2007.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-61</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-60</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Barnardo&rsquo;s Child Poverty Briefing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Barnardo&rsquo;s on the publication of its most recent child poverty briefing; notes with concern the issues highlighted in this report, that despite progress, one in four young people in Scotland live in poverty in a steadily growing economy, that present strategies are unlikely to meet a national target of halving child poverty within three years and that underlying structural inequalities must be addressed; further notes that one in five families are not claiming tax credits to which they are entitled, that half of Scotland&rsquo;s children in poverty live in households that have at least one earner and that 30% of low-paid jobs are in the public sector and action in this sector could have a significant effect, and calls on the Scottish Executive to extend free school meals entitlement, extend access to high quality childcare, set up a Scottish commission to make further proposals to end child poverty in Scotland by 2020, expand Sure Start Scotland and quality early years provision, institute an accelerated programme of house insulation and home energy efficiency to permanently reduce fuel poverty and take urgent action to curb the rapacious activities of doorstep lenders and even some banks with respect to interest charges.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-59&diams; </strong> <strong>Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Tartan Day Celebrations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament compliments the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Scottish Executive, Angus Council and other Scottish local authorities for their work in developing the concept of Tartan Day, which marks an annual celebration of the historical enactment of the Arbroath Declaration made on 6 April 1320 and seeks to renew the close historical, cultural, trading and other links between Scotland and the rest of the world, with particular attention being paid to countries where the Scottish diaspora is greatest and encourages the development of individual and international friendship and goodwill through Tartan Day celebrations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-58</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Dumfries House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the national and international importance of&nbsp;Dumfries House, near Cumnock, which contains one of the finest surviving collections of Chippendale rococo furniture and furniture by the pre-eminent 18th century Scottish cabinetmakers in existence; expresses concern that Dumfries House and its unique and highly significant collection could be sold, broken up and lost to the nation; calls on the Scottish Executive to work with the National Trust for Scotland, the Art Fund, the National Lottery and East Ayrshire Council to discuss with the current owners the opportunity to acquire and preserve Dumfries House and its full collection intact for the benefit of the people of East Ayrshire and Scotland, and recognises the potential economic benefits to Cumnock and the East Ayrshire area of the preservation of Dumfries House and the importance of ensuring that the public is able to discover and enjoy this unique house and its collection.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-57</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Dalmuir Waste Water Treatment Works</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing odour problems that have bedevilled Dalmuir waste water treatment works; recognises that poor operational practices have contributed to the seriousness of the problems but that the underlying cause is poor design of the storage tanks and the inadequacy of the plant to deal with the volume of waste water, especially after heavy rain; calls on ministers to take the steps necessary to rectify these odour problems which are particularly pungent during the summer months; welcomes the commitment of the previous Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development to provide resources to rectify the serious odour problems at the Seafield waste water treatment works in Edinburgh; considers that the new Scottish Executive should make the same commitment to eliminating the odour problems at Dalmuir; notes the new powers given to local authorities from 1 April 2007 to require high odour standards of Scottish Water, and calls on ministers, Scottish Water and West Dunbartonshire Council to make immediate use of these powers, together with resources announced by the previous deputy minister, in order to deal urgently with the totally unacceptable smell emanating from Dalmuir waste water treatment works.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-56</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>National Epilepsy Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament asks that the Scottish Executive acknowledges the work of epilepsy organisations, in the Joint Epilepsy Council of the UK and Ireland, to address epilepsy and employment issues during National Epilepsy Week from 20 to 26 May 2007; further asks that the Executive takes appropriate measures to address research findings which show that a person with epilepsy in Scotland is twice as likely to be at risk of unemployment and underemployment than someone without a disability, and finally asks the Executive to welcome the launch of Epilepsy Scotland&rsquo;s new free epilepsy guide for employers in the Scottish Parliament during National Epilepsy Week 2007.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-55</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Waitrose Supermarkets for Starting Plastic Bag Reduction</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes recent supermarket initiatives to encourage customers to re-use plastic bags, including Waitrose supermarkets&rsquo; &quot;green till&quot; initiative, where one till in each store does not supply plastic bags, which is being piloted this week at 14 stores including Morningside in south Edinburgh; encourages supermarkets to take even bolder steps to reduce packaging and waste, and calls on the new Scottish Executive to ensure that supermarkets keep to their agreement to reduce plastic bag impact by 25% by 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-54</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Local Delivery of Health Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates and supports the Scottish Executive for its commitment to health services being delivered at a local level; calls on the Executive urgently to review any plans to reduce the delivery of health services at a local level, and further calls on the Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board to reconsider any further plans to reduce or remove services from the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-53</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Nuclear Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the demolition of the Chapelcross cooling towers; notes that potentially hazardous nuclear waste from Hunterston and Torness is regularly transported across the south of Scotland; notes the comments of the then Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Darling MP, on 7 June 2005 that it is for the Scottish Executive &quot;to decide whether a large nuclear power station should be built&quot; (<em>Official Report</em>, House of Commons, 7 June 2005; Vol 434, c 1110); welcomes the comments from the new Scottish government that it will not support any new nuclear power stations in Scotland, and supports its moves to make Scotland nuclear-free and a global leader in clean renewable energy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-52</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Area Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of North Lanarkshire Council to re-establish its north area committee and north area partnership; further notes that a proposal was unsuccessfully presented to establish a Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area committee; believes that Cumbernauld and Kilsyth is a distinct part of the North Lanarkshire area, with neither community a part of Lanarkshire historically, and was formerly a local authority area in its own right; further notes that the other area committees established in North Lanarkshire cover much smaller populations and that Cumbernauld is the most populated town in the local authority area; considers that it would be in the best interests of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth if they either formed a distinctive area committee or had an area committee for each community, and calls on North Lanarkshire Council to reconsider its decision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-51</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Israeli-Palestinian Relations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the deterioration in Israeli-Palestinian relations and the possible consequences for ordinary people caught up in the ongoing conflict; believes that reconciliation and compromise from both sides is the only way forward in resolving this issue, and, to this end, expresses grave disappointment at the decision to demolish the Al Ansari library in Jerusalem, one of the most important libraries in Jerusalem housing a collection of over 30,000 books in Arabic, the destruction of which would be both a great blow to the cultural survival of the Palestinian people and any chances of a peaceful settlement to this conflict.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-50</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Single Transferable Vote</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the single transferable vote deeply disadvantages candidates with surnames towards the end of the alphabet when two or more candidates from a single party stand in the same council ward; is aware that in Cunninghame North, in the eight instances that two or more candidates from either the Conservative, Labour or Scottish National party stood, in every case the candidate whose surname came first in the alphabet obtained a much higher number of votes for that ward than colleagues whose surnames were further on in the alphabet; notes that the bigger the alphabetic gap the bigger the gulf in votes; is aware that this took place even on the two occasions where surnames were grouped by party and that the pattern was repeated elsewhere in Scotland, and therefore resolves, in the interests of fairness, that where more than one candidate from a party stands, their position on the ballot paper should be decided by lottery.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-49</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Date of Scottish Parliament and Local Authority Elections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that Scotland would be better served by having Scottish Parliament and local authority elections on separate dates.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-48</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Parliament Elections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continued apathy with which a large segment of the population views elections to the Scottish Parliament and local government; believes that the plethora of electorally insignificant parties and campaign literature freely delivered by Royal Mail contributes to confusion and voter fatigue, and calls on the Scottish Executive to hold discussions with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government with a view to increasing the number of members a party must have in order to stand in elections from three to 100, ensuring that new political parties register a year or more before polling day, abolishing free delivery of election communications by Royal Mail, and introducing a deposit for each candidate standing on the regional list.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-47&diams; </strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Threatened Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply concerned at Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s proposals to reduce the number of post offices in Scotland from 1,664 in December 2006, two-thirds of which are in rural and island communities, by upwards of 200 by 2009; is aware that in Cunninghame North, Kilmory Post Office on the Island of Arran has already closed this year and that, according to Hansard, 16 of the remaining 23 in the constituency are under threat; recognises that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s action in recent years has directly contributed towards the reduction in post office numbers by removing vital services essential for their economic viability such as pensions, benefits, television licences and soon driving licences, while diverting much of its own business from the Royal Mail to the private sector; acknowledges that post offices provide a vital social, as well as economic, service often to very vulnerable people, at the heart of large and small communities alike; notes that Postwatch Scotland, responding to the recent Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) consultation, stated that the DTI did not take Scotland&rsquo;s special circumstances into account as its proposals &quot;seem to have been prepared without any consideration of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policy framework on rural development, social inclusion and sustainable development&quot;; opposes the threat to the Universal Service Obligation, and believes that the Executive should express its opposition to further post office closures in the strongest possible terms and take practical steps where possible to ameliorate Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s action by channelling Executive business towards the Royal Mail, enhancing the post office card account and using it as a basis for community banking, working with local authorities to support post offices as part of rural and urban development projects, improving post office access to European small business funding and establishing a rural community action programme similar to that provided by the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-46</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Roman Antonine Guard</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work carried out by the charity, The Antonine Guard, to educate people and inspire them to learn more about Scotland&rsquo;s Roman history; notes that our Roman heritage has helped shape today&rsquo;s Scotland; believes that more must be done to safeguard Roman remains and sites in Scotland, such as Ardoch Roman Fort in Perthshire; further believes that Scotland&rsquo;s Roman history should not just be preserved but be used as an educational tool to get children interested in Scotland&rsquo;s past and to learn about conservation; supports the application to see the Antonine Wall gain World Heritage status, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider the creation of a national Roman centre in an area of Scotland that has strong links to Scotland&rsquo;s Roman past.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-45</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Continuing the Campaign to Beat Bowel Cancer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the fundraising event being held on 28 July 2007, in the Richard Donald suite at Pittodrie Stadium, in aid of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary; hopes that local businesses will support the occasion and the ongoing efforts to improve bowel cancer care and treatment; recognises the contribution of events such as this, and campaigns such as the annual Loud Tie campaign run by Beating Bowel Cancer, in raising awareness of bowel cancer; notes that more than 3,500 new cases of bowel cancer are diagnosed each year in Scotland; welcomes the progress that has been made in treating the disease, in particular the roll-out from March 2007 of a national screening programme that will see over 650,000 potentially vulnerable people being screened by 2009, and supports further efforts to improve bowel cancer care.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-44</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>A Secure Future for Crichton Campus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports maintaining the University of Glasgow Crichton Campus in Dumfries; recognises the excellent work of the campus as a centre of higher education in the south west of Scotland; believes that maintaining the campus is vital for the local economy, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with the Scottish Funding Council, the University of Glasgow, the University of Paisley, Bell College and Dumfries and Galloway College in reaching a decision on a sustainable future for the campus as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-43#</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Demolition of Cooling Towers at Chapelcross Power Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates British Nuclear Group on the successful demolition of the four cooling towers at Chapelcross Power Station on Sunday 20 May 2007 and believes that the Scottish Executive should not predetermine any application made to it under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, including for a replacement nuclear power station at Chapelcross, but that it should examine any such application on its merits.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-42</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Dundee&rsquo;s Grove Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dundee&rsquo;s Grove Academy on its recent success in winning the English-Speaking Union Schools Mace; acknowledges that this is the first time a Scottish state school has won the prestigious event; hopes that this is the first of many victories for the school, and wishes it every success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-41</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Affordable Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the steps taken by the previous Labour-Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive in delivering record investment into affordable housing, including the building of 21,500 affordable homes to rent or buy by 2008; however acknowledges the need for increased investment in building affordable homes, and calls on the Executive to recognise the recent Shelter survey that shows that eight out of 10 people living in Scotland think that affordable rented housing is in short supply and to make a commitment to building at least an additional 27,000 affordable homes over the period of the next spending review.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-40</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Education is a Human Right</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Global Campaign for Education event at Moray House on 30 May 2007 with young people from Clarkston, Lawmuir, Echline and Dunnikier primary schools and Kirkcaldy High School, from Malawi who are visiting Kirkcaldy High as part of a school exchange programme and from Save the Children&rsquo;s YES project in Glasgow and young gypsy/travellers attending to highlight the campaign; acknowledges that education is a basic human right; notes that 80 million children around the world, most of whom are girls, are still being denied the opportunity of going to school and almost one billion adults are illiterate; supports the goal to ensure free and compulsory primary education of good quality for all by 2015; urges the UK Government to continue to drive forward this important&nbsp;agenda and to deliver for children around the world, and supports the efforts of the members of the Global Campaign for Education, including Save the Children and Oxfam in Scotland, in raising awareness of the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-39#</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Expanding Higher Education Provision at the Crichton Campus in Dumfries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the creation of the University of the West of Scotland, through the merger of the University of Paisley and Bell College, and its commitment to its four sites, including the Crichton Campus in Dumfries; believes that this should result in increased opportunities for higher education in Dumfries and Galloway but recognises that this will not substitute for the undergraduate courses offered at the Crichton by the University of Glasgow; is therefore very concerned that Glasgow University does not intend to recruit any first-year undergraduate students this year, and believes that the Scottish Executive should continue to work with the Scottish Funding Council and the University of Glasgow to find a solution that will reverse this position and will guarantee that Glasgow University will continue to offer undergraduate degree courses to students at the Crichton.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-38&diams; </strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Town Centre Regeneration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the pressing need for regeneration of many of our town centres, including Dumfries, the county town of Dumfries and Galloway; believes that national and local agencies should work together to develop local plans, and further believes that the Scottish Executive should consider enabling the establishment of town centre trusts with legal powers to initiate compulsory purchase orders and also consider setting up a town centre turnaround fund as part of this year&rsquo;s spending review.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-37#</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Success of Community Warden Scheme in North West Dumfries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the success of the community warden scheme in north-west Dumfries in tackling antisocial behaviour, promoting alternative activities for young people and working with the police to improve safety in the local community; welcomes the extension of the scheme into other parts of Dumfries and Galloway, such as Annan, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider making further funding available to enable local authorities to increase the numbers of community wardens working in their communities.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-12*#*</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Norwegian Commercial Co-operation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Norway celebrates the 102nd anniversary of its independence on 17 May 2007; welcomes growing economic co-operation between Scotland and Norway to make the most of our sustainable marine hydrocarbon and renewable energy resources, our proximity across the North Sea and ongoing civic and cultural collaborations; in particular welcomes the announcement of a new partnership between Statoil and Scottish Power which aims to produce a commercially viable tidal energy device for a full-scale trial to be run within two years; considers that the Scottish Executive should work with the Norwegian government to create a North Sea electricity supergrid to serve continental markets with secure supplies of clean power, and also believes that the prospects for creating a direct sea route for freight and passengers to link our two nations should be pursued with vigour.</p>
