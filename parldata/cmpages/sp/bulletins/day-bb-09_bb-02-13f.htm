<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3447</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Big Lottery Fund Lends Support to HOPE Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates HOPE Scotland, based in Glasgow Shettleston, which has been awarded a grant of &pound;322,583 from the Investing in Communities programme of the Big Lottery Fund; welcomes the intention to use the money to support the Family and Relationships project, which aims to support disadvantaged families in addressing the challenges posed by parenting and to assist in building and maintaining relationships between generations in order to strengthen family units across a diverse range of family structures; is pleased, that while the organisation is based in the east end of Glasgow, it works to serve the entire city of Glasgow, and considers it to be of great benefit to the local communities that the Families and Relationships project will be carried out by 25 volunteers and benefit 320 vulnerable and isolated families over four years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3446</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>200th Anniversary of Darwin</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling by the Royal Mail of stamps commemorating the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin; recognises the tremendous leap forward that took place in our understanding of the origins of all life on earth with the publication of <em>On the Origin of Species</em> and Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution, and welcomes the fact that, in the intervening 150 years since the theory was published, evidence has continued to accumulate to support evolution as the only credible explanation of the origin of our species.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Jim Tolson<strong>*</strong>, Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong>, Jackson Carlaw<strong>*</strong>, Joe FitzPatrick<strong>*</strong>, Bill Wilson<strong>*</strong>, Liam McArthur<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3445</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh&rsquo;s The Soap Co</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Edinburgh-based social enterprise The Soap Co for its policy of incorporating a diverse and socially inclusive workforce into its business; praises the use of traditional and environmentally conscientious methods in the production of its goods; applauds The Soap Co&rsquo;s use of the social enterprise not-for-profit model, which provides a financially stable, social and sustainable business model that many Scottish businesses could adopt and benefit from in the midst of the current recession; recognises the need to promote the development of social enterprises like The Soap Co across Scotland, and welcomes the contribution of Social Firms UK in helping to facilitate this.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3444</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>St Mirren Football Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that St Mirren Football Club was established in 1877 and is one of the oldest football clubs in Scotland; further notes that St Mirren Football Club was a founder member of the Scottish League in 1890 and moved to Love Street in 1894; acknowledges the club&rsquo;s success in winning the Scottish Cup in 1926, 1959 and 1987; notes that the move from Love Street to the new St Mirren Park stadium provides a tremendous new stadium that will benefit both the club and the wider community, and wishes St Mirren Football Club success both on and off the field in this new chapter in its long history.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3443&diams; </strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Advanced Driving</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that most road accidents are caused by driver error and therefore are potentially avoidable; further notes that significant improvements in driver safety can be achieved through advanced driving courses, especially in respect of observation and hazard awareness skills; recognises that a better driving technique can reduce fuel consumption and vehicle maintenance and insurance costs, benefiting both the driver and the environment; commends the work of the Institute of Advanced Motorists and in particular the Forth Valley (Stirling) Group that, with sponsorship from Ineos, are offering an advanced driving course targeted at young drivers, which is more comprehensive and considerably cheaper than the Pass Plus course, and believes that there is enormous potential in advanced driving courses with benefits that far outweigh the costs, that the extension and wider availability of such schemes should be supported and that young and inexperienced drivers should be encouraged to participate.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3442</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Rape as a Weapon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the use of rape as a weapon; notes that the rape capital of the world is the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where in some areas three-quarters of women have been raped; further notes that in Darfur raped women are scarred or branded or have their ears cut off and that this is often done by police officers or soldiers, in uniform, as part of a coordinated government policy, and calls on HM Government to condemn violence against women, to work to highlight this abhorrent use of force in conflicts around the world and do everything that it can to prevent the systematic use of rape as a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3441&diams; </strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Childhood Cancer: More Than My Illness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament highlights a survey by children&rsquo;s cancer charity CLIC Sargent that found that 97% of children and young people with cancer say that it is important for them to be able to return home during their treatment but that many parents in Scotland say that they do not get the support that they need when their child is at home; notes that children and young people say that living with cancer is about more than their illness; expresses concern at findings that about half of parents who want support with the education of their child with cancer, such as access to home tutoring, are not getting it or are finding that it is insufficient; recognises the need to help children and young people and their families in rural and urban areas across Scotland to keep up with their ordinary lives; welcomes CLIC Sargent&rsquo;s report, <em>More Than My Illness</em>, published on 13 February 2009, proposing innovative ways of reaching families of sick children across Scotland; notes the success of the Royal Aberdeen Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the CLIC Sargent nurse in helping to coordinate and plan aspects of care and support for children in Aberdeenshire; further welcomes the commitment to both specialist and local support made by the <em>National Delivery Plan for Children and Young People&rsquo;s Specialist Services in Scotland</em>, and highlights the need for key workers to better coordinate and plan all aspects of care and support for every child and young person with cancer.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3440</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>50th Edition of the Scottish Left Review</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>Scottish Left Review </em>on the publication of its 50th edition; notes that the review was established in 2000 and seeks to provide a focal point for thought and discussion for the Scottish left; believes that the magazine plays an important non-party role in promoting a positive and progressive perspective on Scotland&rsquo;s current affairs, and looks forward to many more successful editions in the months and years to come.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3439</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken on behalf of the Justice Committee:</strong> <strong>Report on Inquiry into Community Policing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Justice Committee&rsquo;s 18th Report, 2008 (Session 3): <em>Report on Inquiry into Community Policing </em>(SP Paper 155).</p>
