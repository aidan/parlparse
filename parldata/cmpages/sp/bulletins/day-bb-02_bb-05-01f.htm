            welcomes ME awareness week, 12-19 May 2002, which aims to raise the 
            profile of the disease, myalgic encephalomyelitis; recognises in particular 
            the role that the 25% ME Group based in Troon play in improving the 
            lives of people affected by ME and the lives of their families, and

            parental choice and the dismissal of the option of single vaccines; 
            further notes that the report highlights the requirement for action 
            on the Public Health Institute for Scotland&#146;s <em>Autistic Spectrum 
            Disorder-Needs Assessment Report</em>, and recommends the immediate

          <p><strong>*S1M-3052</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: Powers of the

            Executive has not delivered the improvements in public services expected 
            by the Scottish people; believes that the people of Scotland deserve 
            better, and recognises that only with the full powers of independence

            that 27 April 2002 was Freedom Day for South Africa, marking the promulgation 
            of the non-racial democratic constitution in 1994; further notes that 
            Freedom Day also coincides with the first multi-racial elections in 
            South Africa in 1994 in which the ANC won 64% of the vote and Nelson 
            Mandela was elected the first black president on 10 May, and resolves

            level through local authority youth councils, or at national level 
            through organisations such as the Scottish Youth Parliament; believes 
            that, given the alarming decrease in young people voting in elections 
            in recent years, schools and voluntary groups should take a lead in
