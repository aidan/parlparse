<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#fend">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5105</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Funding Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Scottish Executive has a responsibility, which includes the allocation of appropriate funding to assist local authorities, in agreement with the trade unions, to achieve equal pay and maintain public services.</p>
<p>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Colin Fox<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5104</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Housing Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to embark on a programme of council house building; believes that the chronic shortage of affordable new homes has led to a huge increase in house prices in Scotland; notes that the average cost of a new home is now &pound;130,000 and thus excludes more than one third of Scots from owning their own homes; demands that the UK Treasury releases the funds already identified to provide the necessary social housing that local circumstances demand; believes that tenants across Scotland have repeatedly rejected housing stock transfer, seeing it as plain and simple privatisation; believes in the fullest democratic control and management of council homes by tenants; welcomes the decision of Midlothian Council to build 1,000 new houses; calls on the tenants of both Highland and Inverclyde councils to follow the example of council tenants in Edinburgh, Stirling and Renfrewshire and reject privatisation of their housing stock; believes that the promises made to Glasgow tenants by Glasgow Housing Association have not been kept, and believes that stock transfer, the Executive&rsquo;s flagship housing policy, is now in tatters.</p>
<p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5103</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Office of the Clerk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Office of the Clerk will be closed on 27, 28 and 29 December 2006.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5102</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1 be completed by 2 February 2007.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5101</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Kinship Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that kinship care is often the best way to look after children from disintegrated families and is concerned about the uneven financial support given by local authorities to kinship carers, ranging from 12 authorities which pay a full fostering allowance to three which pay nothing, and encourages Scottish ministers and local authorities to work together to provide a system whereby all kinship carers are paid the same rate as foster carers and a new status of &quot;looked after in kinship care&quot; is created, as proposed in the report, <em>Looking After the Family: A Study of Children Looked after in Kinship Care in Scotland</em>, by Professor Jane Aldgate and Miranda McIntosh.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5100</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Excessive and Illegal Use of Force by Chinese People&rsquo;s Armed Police on Tibetan Civilians</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that on 30 September 2006 independent observers witnessed members of the Chinese People&rsquo;s Armed Police fire on unarmed Tibetans attempting to cross into Nepal over the glaciated Nanga Pass, killing one of their number, Kelsang Namtso, a 17-year-old nun, before proceeding to arrest others including children and, having regard to the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and noting that video and photographic evidence from the incident shows that the Tibetan group was moving slowly away from the Chinese forces firing on them and did not approach nor represent a threat to those forces, condemns the excessive use of force by the Chinese People&rsquo;s Armed Police in firing on unarmed Tibetan civilians, including children; strongly condemns the killing of an unarmed civilian who, being below 18 years of age, was also considered to be a child under international law; expresses its dismay at the imprisonment of Tibetan civilians of whom nine are children; urges the Chinese authorities to guarantee that the Tibetans detained during the incident will not be ill-treated in detention and that international human rights and humanitarian law standards will be respected; urges the Chinese authorities immediately to release all children detained during the incident; further urges the Chinese authorities to conduct a full investigation into the events at Nanga Pass and ensure that those responsible for any crimes committed there are brought to justice, and calls on the Government of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China to continue the dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama in order to improve the respect of religious, cultural, linguistic and political rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5099#</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>World Diabetes Day 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its support for World Diabetes Day 2006 on 14 November and the launch of the year-long campaign to raise awareness of the impact of diabetes among disadvantaged and vulnerable groups; notes the campaign&rsquo;s message that every person with diabetes, or at risk of diabetes, deserves the best quality of education, prevention and care that is possible; is concerned that people on the lowest incomes are around twice as likely as those on the highest incomes to develop type 2 diabetes and that the prevalence of diabetes in the most deprived areas is over two-thirds higher than in the most affluent; further notes that black and minority ethnic groups are at least five times more likely to develop diabetes than their Caucasian counterparts and are more likely to live in more deprived areas; recognises the developing epidemic of diabetes in young people in Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups are fully addressed in the roll-out of the Scottish Diabetes Framework Action Plan and that resources for diabetes awareness, screening and early intervention treatment to reduce long-term costs to the NHS are made available to all of Scotland&rsquo;s NHS boards.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mrs Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, John Scott<strong>*</strong>, Scott Barrie<strong>*</strong>, Alex Fergusson<strong>*</strong>, Dave Petrie<strong>*</strong>, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, John Swinburne<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenneth Macintosh<strong>*</strong>, Kate Maclean<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5098.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Supporting Positive Transitions from School Towards Work</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5098) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;is therefore deeply concerned that so many young people in Scotland remain disengaged from education, employment or training; is further concerned by recent remarks from CBI Scotland that companies are having &quot;to invest an unacceptably high proportion of the &pound;2 billion they commit to training annually on what is effectively remedial education&quot;; acknowledges, however, that voluntary agencies across Scotland are working hard to engage young people who are NEET; congratulates the Smith Group, which is dedicated to empowering such agencies already involved in this work; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s financial support provided to many of these agencies but, in light of the extreme difficulties voluntary organisations routinely face in terms of accessing secure funding, calls on it to reduce the bureaucracy involved in applying for funds and to ensure that long-term funding is available for successful and proven projects.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5098.2</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Supporting Positive Transitions from School Towards Work</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5098) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;is concerned about the numbers of young people not in education, employment or training; recognises that there is a need to address the reasons why schools are failing these young people and to take immediate action to address these problems by reducing class sizes, offering a broader curriculum and engaging more with young people, their parents and their communities, and calls on the Scottish Executive to offer fully supported and resourced modern apprenticeships based on the needs of young people and communities.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5098.3</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Supporting Positive Transitions from School Towards Work</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5098) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;and endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets the poor performance of the current Scottish Executive which has led to far more of our young people, compared with their European peers, not in education, employment or training; calls for a fresh approach to engage schools, colleges, voluntary organisations and employers in Scotland to recognise the importance of early intervention for children, particularly those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, to realise their potential in later life and so secure the opportunities that other young Scots enjoy, and recognises that, for Scotland to achieve a situation where every 16 to 19-year-old can have the opportunity to secure a place in education, employment, training or volunteering, it will require a concerted national effort and support from all sectors in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5080*#*</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>WHSmith and Scottish Publishing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the huge contribution made by literature and the wider publishing industry to Scottish culture and the Scottish economy; notes that the cultural and economic benefits which they provide are particularly important for the capital city, Edinburgh, UNESCO World City of Literature; condemns, therefore, the overly centralised buying system operated by high street bookstore WHSmith from its Swindon headquarters; notes that the company&rsquo;s buying policies result in very few Scottish titles finding their way on to WHSmith shelves; recognises that, as WHSmith has a 20% share of the Scottish consumer book market, its policy of directing all book-buying from outside Scotland has a detrimental effect on Scottish writers, the Scottish publishing industry and the Scottish book-buying public; considers that the Scottish Executive should set up a group to look at the question of asymmetric trading relationships, that is large companies declining to trade with small producers, a relatively common occurrence in Scotland, and further believes that the Executive should draw up a Scottish book retailers code of conduct which ensures that the buying systems of booksellers in this country take into account the distinctive culture and heritage of Scotland and its localities.</p>
