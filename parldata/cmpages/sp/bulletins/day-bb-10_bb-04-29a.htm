                                          <p><strong>S3M-6216 Patrick Harvie: Living Wage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that unacceptable levels of poverty and income inequality continue to blight Scotland; notes that the income of the richest 10% of people in Scotland is approximately the same as the total income of the poorest 50%; further notes that, among working-age adults, in-work poverty is still on the increase; believes that a more equal society would be a happier, healthier, safer and greener society and that this must become a core objective of government at all levels, and therefore calls on the UK Government to commit to the immediate introduction of a living wage for all, set at &pound;7 per hour, and on Scottish ministers to bring in this living wage for all public sector workers and employees of public sector contractors and for this change to be funded by tackling high pay in the public sector and by fairer taxation on both high pay and financial transactions. </p>

                                            <p><strong>S3M-6216.4 Andy Kerr: Living Wage</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6216) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was one of the most seminal pieces of the legislation of the twentieth century in terms of promoting dignity at work but regrets that it was finally passed without the votes of any Conservative or SNP MPs; welcomes the commitment in Labour&rsquo;s 2010 manifesto to further increase the minimum wage at least in line with earnings over the next five years and the further extension of the living wage in government departments; notes the example set by Glasgow City Council in introducing a living wage for its employees, and supports the further extension of the living wage, working in conjunction with the tax credit system, to ensure that work always pays.&quot; </p>
                                            <p> <strong>S3M-6216.1 Derek Brownlee: Living Wage</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6216) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;a more equal&quot; to end and insert &quot;economic growth is the best means of tackling poverty and inequality, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to pursue measures to boost the economy, create jobs and improve the standard of living for all.&quot; </p>
                                            <p> <strong>S3M-6216.3 Jeremy Purvis: Living Wage</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6216) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;therefore&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that, during the tight financial climate, public sector pay policy should be structured to ensure that those on lower incomes benefit more than those on higher incomes from pay changes.&quot; </p>
