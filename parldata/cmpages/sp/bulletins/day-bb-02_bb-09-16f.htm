the Parliament recognises and celebrates Scottish Mental Health Week 2002; welcomes 
the various initiatives taking place during this time including the performance 
by the 7:84 Theatre Company in the Parliament on 10 October 2002, and further 
welcomes the on-going work carried out by national organisations and the invaluable 
dedicated support network of local voluntary organisations in their struggle to 
provide adequate services and to combat the stigma attached to mental illness.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3389#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Richard Lochhead: HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Report on HM Prison Aberdeen</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the decision by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, Clive Fairweather, 
to publish an unprecedented and highly critical intermediate report on HM Prison 
Aberdeen that highlights serious staffing difficulties, violence and the lack 
of any meaningful regime; further notes that the report describes the prison's 
needs assessment, sentence management and pre-release arrangements as inadequate; 
condemns the Scottish Prison Service management for allowing such a situation 
to develop; expresses extreme concern that the report states that no drugs strategy 
is in place at the prison despite the huge drug problem in the north-east of Scotland 
and the fact that Aberdeen has some of the highest crime rates in Scotland all 
of which are drug-related, and considers that both the Scottish Executive and 
one of the Justice Committees should investigate conditions at Craiginches and 
the prison's role in reducing re-offending.</P><P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P>

to the peoples, regions and nations of the Nordic area in terms of social, political

peoples, regions and nations of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and believes 
that closer political ties and links with the Nordic Council and between the Scottish 
Executive and the Nordic Council of Ministers should be developed.</P><P>Supported

the Parliament congratulates CancerBACUP Scotland on opening its new centre in 
Glasgow to provide information and support to anyone affected by cancer; recognises 
that cancer is one of Scotland's biggest public health problems; notes that CancerBACUP's 
specialist nurses answer more than 50,000 questions a year on all types of cancer 
and that the new centre will enable the charity to answer an extra 18,000 enquiries 
every year<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">, </FONT>and applauds the efforts of the Sunday 
Mail and people all over Scotland in raising funds for this initiative to support 
cancer patients and their families and friends.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3386 Mr Mike 
Rumbles on behalf of the Standards Committee: Code of Conduct for Members of the 
Scottish Parliament: Disclosure of Complaints</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
agrees to amend paragraph 10.2.1 of the Code of Conduct for Members of the Scottish 
Parliament as follows: leave out &quot;MSPs should not communicate any complaint 
to the press or other media until a decision has been made as to how the complaint

or discuss any complaint or intention to make a complaint with members of the 
press or media prior to the lodging of the complaint or while the Standards Committee 
is receiving assistance from an adviser appointed under paragraph 10.2.8 in relation 
to the complaint. The Standards Committee is to be regarded as receiving the assistance 
of an adviser appointed under paragraph 10.2.8 in relation to a complaint until 
it has confirmed that no assistance or further assistance from any such adviser 
will be sought. Where, during the period when the restriction applies, any complaint 
or intention to make a complaint has been publicised in the press or media without 
the involvement of the Member who is the subject of the complaint, that Member 
may issue a brief statement. In doing so, a Member should, as far as possible, 
avoid discussing details of the complaint or intention to make a complaint.&quot; 
</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3385</STRONG> <STRONG>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Arnold Kemp</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament pays tribute to the magnificent service rendered to Scotland by 
Arnold Kemp, former editor of <em>The Herald </em>newspaper and latterly former 
news editor of <em>The Observer</em>; recognises him as a great and heroic editor, 
in both Scottish and European terms, who campaigned steadfastly for Scottish devolution 
and humanitarian causes and who, like his late father Robert Kemp, was an influence 
for enduring good, delivering his outstanding intellectual gifts with the sparkle 
of grace, style, kindness and humour, and extends its deep sympathy to Mr Kemp's 
family and partner on his untimely loss to them and to Scotland.</P><P>Supported 
by: Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3384#</STRONG> <STRONG>Iain Smith: Review 
of Secondary School Accommodation in North East Fife</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
believes that Fife Council should conduct an urgent review of secondary school 
accommodation in the north-east Fife area, including examining the feasibility 
of a new secondary school to serve north Fife, the creation of a single-site school 
for Madras College, St Andrews, and ensuring that Waid Academy in Anstruther has 
sufficient accommodation to meet future demand.</P><P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3383#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Government Campaign to Run Down Glasgow</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow <em>Evening Times</em> for its excellent 
expos&eacute; of Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s 25-year campaign to run 
down Glasgow; notes with concern that official documents provide evidence of official 
efforts to keep new industry and jobs out of Glasgow, move existing firms and 
jobs from Glasgow and drive Glasgow citizens into new towns; further notes with 
concern that the <em>Evening Times&#146;</em> report suggests that Glasgow is still 
the victim of institutionalised bias, and therefore believes that the Scottish 
Executive should consider urgently measures to halt any continuing anti-Glasgow 
bias and adopt policies and provide investment which will end Glasgow&#146;s decline 
and aid its regeneration.</P><P>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3377</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Irene McGugan: Scottish Football</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
with concern the current demise of Scottish football at both club and international 
levels; calls on the Scottish Executive to urgently obtain from the Scottish Football 
Association a detailed report confirming the current status of the report commissioned 
from Ernie Walker's Think-tank, including any aspects which have been implemented, 
areas outstanding and parts needing to be updated in view of changing events and 
circumstances, and further calls on the Executive to ensure that funding by it, 
either directly or indirectly, to football bodies and organisations is dependent 
on the report as updated being implemented in full and without further delay.</P><P>Supported 
by: Richard Lochhead, Alex Neil, Mr Kenneth Gibson, Michael Matheson, Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3374#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Marilyn Livingstone: National Construction Week 3-10 October 2002</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament supports National Construction Week from 3 to 10 October 2002 and 
recognises the many economic advantages for Scotland that an expanding construction 
industry will bring, notably in employment preservation and creation, training, 
skills and provision of the built environment; supports the industry&#146;s schemes 
to register construction firms through the Construction Licensing Executive and 
workers through approved registration schemes, thereby protecting the public by 
eradicating rogue traders, enhancing the industry&#146;s image, and improving 
the skills base and health and safety practices; acknowledges that the Scottish 
Executive, local authorities and other government bodies can assist by (a) supporting 
registration schemes by insisting that all public works contractors are committed 
to them, (b) supporting the education and training infrastructure so that it meets 
Scotland&#146;s construction requirements, (c) acting as an enlightened client 
by ensuring, where possible, advanced programmes of work on which the industry 
can plan its skills requirements and provide its workforce with security of employment 
and (d) ensuring that public works contracts are fair, open, effective and straightforward 
to administer and deliver.</P><P>Supported by: Alex Neil, Janis Hughes, Michael 
Matheson</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3373</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Colon Cancer 
Concern CCC Roadshow</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Colon Cancer 
Concern on its national education campaign, the CCC Roadshow, which is visiting 
16 towns and city centres across the UK, notes that the campaign is designed to 
increase awareness of colorectal cancer, the third most common type of cancer 
in the UK and the second most common cause of cancer death; wishes Colon Cancer 
Concern all success in its campaign, and urges the Scottish Executive to give 
its full support to the campaign and provide whatever assistance is necessary 
to increase awareness of colorectal cancer.</P><P>Supported by: Alex Neil, Mr

<STRONG>Shona Robison: Ninewells Hospital's Participation in BBC Television Series</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates the staff of Ninewells Hospital for taking part in 
the BBC television series &quot;Ninewells&quot;, which is following the work of 
the accident and emergency department at the hospital; recognises the hard work 
and dedication of the staff involved, and appreciates their professionalism in 
often difficult and challenging circumstances, as demonstrated by the programme.</P><P>Supported 
by: Bruce Crawford, Mr Kenneth Gibson, Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3371</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Michael Russell: Scottish Media Group - Sale of Publishing Business</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the decision of the Scottish Media Group to sell <em>The Herald, 
The Sunday Herald</em> and <em>The Evening Times</em> as well as a range of magazine 
titles; expresses the view that it is important that the sale, particularly of 
the newspapers, helps to increase the diversity of media ownership in Scotland 
and does not further concentrate it in a few hands; calls on Her Majesty&#146;s 
Government to ensure that any consideration of monopoly issues which may be raised 
by the sale is based on the recognition of a Scottish media market as opposed 
to a UK one, and is firmly of the opinion that any sale must not compromise the 
editorial independence, integrity and overall quality of the newspapers which 
presently make a considerable contribution to Scottish life.<STRONG><em> R</em></STRONG></P><P>Supported 
by: Christine Grahame, Richard Lochhead, Alex Neil, Michael Matheson</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3370</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Paul Martin: Policy Advice on Glasgow in the Post Second World War Period</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with concern the poor policy advice relating to Glasgow provided 
by Scottish Office advisers during the period after the second world war and calls 
on the Scottish Executive to take steps to ensure that the recommendations of 
the cities review will act as a means towards continuing to develop an ambitious 
and vibrant Glasgow. </P><P>Supported by: Janis Hughes</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3369</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Cathy Jamieson: Protection of Children (Scotland) Bill</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Protection of Children 
(Scotland) Bill.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3367#</STRONG> <STRONG>Robin Harper: Torness 
Nuclear Power Station</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament considers that the Scottish 
Executive should request that Her Majesty&#146;s Government seek an urgent and 
transparent investigation by HM Nuclear Installations Inspectorate into the recent 
failure of the gas circulators at Torness nuclear power station and give an assurance 
that the power station will not reopen if repair and consequent operation of the 
existing design could lead to a nuclear accident.</P><P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3356

of the White Paper on crofting reform and encourages crofters to participate in 
the consultation now underway; further notes the level of agricultural returns

Mr Brian Monteith<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3203</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr 
Andy Kerr: Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting 
from the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, agrees to the following expenditure 
out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund&#150;</P><P></P><OL TYPE="a"> <P><LI>expenditure

other enactment.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace, Dr Richard Simpson, Peter 
Peacock</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3191#</STRONG> <STRONG>Irene McGugan: Dundee Heritage 
Trust</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that our industrial heritage 
is of interest to many people from other countries as well as Scots; notes with 
concern, however, that despite strenuous efforts and exploration of all possible 
funding opportunities, Dundee Heritage Trust, the charity which owns Dundee's 
leading tourist attractions, RRS Discovery and the Verdant Works, has been forced 
by a continuing and critical shortfall in revenue support into a series of cost-cutting 
exercises and staff redundancies, the latest being the loss of their very experienced 
and committed chief executive; recognises that the seriousness of this move cannot 
be underestimated and is a worrying indication that the closure of both Discovery 
Point and the Verdant Works may now be imminent; considers that the Scottish Executive 
should put in place a financial package with immediate effect and extend central 
revenue support as part of a longer term strategy to secure the future of these 
significant visitor attractions, both of which achieved five star grading by VisitScotland, 
with Dundee Heritage Trust being the only independent operator in Scotland to 
achieve this accolade, and notes that the loss of RRS Discovery, which gives the 
city of Dundee its "identity" and the Verdant Works, the last working jute mill 
in Scotland and European Industrial Museum of the Year in 1999, to the cultural 
heritage of the nation would be both significant and irreplaceable.</P><P>Supported
