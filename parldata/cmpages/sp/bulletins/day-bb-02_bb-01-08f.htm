          <p><strong>*S1M-2578</strong> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: Scottish Executive's 
            Priorities</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the Executive's 
            priorities across Scotland must be to deliver first class public services 
            that help create a Scotland full of opportunity, where children can 
            reach their full potential, and that in 2002 this will mean working 
            in partnership to improve the health service and the health of all, 
            to achieve high employment and promote educational opportunities, 
            to reduce crime and the fear of crime, to build an integrated transport 
            system which meets the needs of all users and to promote sustainable 
            development across Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2577</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Foot-and-Mouth 
            Disease - Public Inquiry</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to instigate a full open public inquiry, either 
            under its aegis or preferably as a distinct part of a full UK inquiry, 
            into the impact of, preparations for and handling of the foot-and-mouth 
            disease outbreak in Scotland, and the economic recovery measures put 
            in place by the Executive and Her Majesty's Government, in order to 
            ensure that lessons are learnt about the appropriate response to any 
            future outbreak.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2576</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Instrumental Teaching 
            in Schools and Support for Music</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            with concern the application of the criterion of &quot;ability to 
            pay&quot; in relation to access to instrumental teaching, which is 
            a crucial element of the music curriculum at Standard and Higher Still 
            grades in schools; believes that such teaching should be `available 
            to all children, free at the point of delivery, and calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to examine the structural underfunding of music 
            which exists and adopt all necessary measures to ensure that every 
            element and genre of musical activity is properly supported and developed 
            in order that future generations of Scottish musicians can continue 
            to achieve international recognition in traditional, classical, acoustic, 
            jazz, folk, rock and popular music.</a></p>
