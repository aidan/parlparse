          <p><strong>*S2M-94</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Charity Law Reform</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that existing charity law is based on a statute 
            that was passed in 1601 and therefore in urgent need of modernisation 
            to reflect today's public perception of a charity; believes that the 
            recommendations arising from the McFadden Commission form the basis 
            of a robust legislative framework fit for the 21st century; recognises 
            public concern about ensuring that charitable donations are used for 
            the core purpose of a charity; welcomes the Scottish Executive's intention 
            to establish the Office of the Scottish Charities Regulator (OSCR) 
            to monitor the activities of charities and ensure transparency; notes 
            that the OSCR will not have full statutory powers to cover all of 
            its functions and that the Scottish Executive will keep under review 
            the need for legislation, but, nevertheless, considers that the urgent 
            need for a comprehensive charities bill is essential to creating a 
            pro-active system of regulation to restore public confidence.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-93#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Promoting Arts Organisations 
            in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the success of 
            the collective enterprise of Edinburgh&#146;s arts organisations in 
            co-operating through The Audience Business to produce accurate statistics 
            for numbers of people attending arts events and working in the arts 
            and to develop a systematic, sustained programme of increasing audience 
            numbers, and considers that the Scottish Executive and the Scottish 
            Arts Council should co-operate with arts organisations and local authorities 
            in promoting similar schemes throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-92</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: Scottish Brass Band 
            Week 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes Scottish Brass 
            Band Week 2003, 24 to 31 May; recognises the importance of brass band 
            playing, with 80 brass bands in communities across Scotland from Lerwick 
            to Loanhead and Arran to Armadale; further recognises brass bands&#146; 
            roots in the mills and collieries of Scotland, and congratulates the 
            Scottish Brass Band Association for its promotion of this important 
            cultural tradition.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-91</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle: Electoral Registration 
            and Victims of Domestic Abuse</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            that victims of domestic abuse can become vulnerable to further abuse 
            and intimidation through publication of their names and addresses 
            on the publicly available electoral register; notes the House of Commons 
            Home Affairs Select Committee&#146;s Fourth Report 1997-98, <em>Electoral 
            Law and Administration</em>, which recognised the calls for a means 
            of registering without having to reveal information that could make 
            the elector vulnerable, and calls on the Electoral Commission and 
            the UK Parliament to give consideration to developing a system to 
            allow anonymous electoral registration in exceptional circumstances, 
            while providing safeguards against electoral fraud, as part of the 
            general review of electoral registration.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-90#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Weekend Ban on Scallop 
            Fishing</strong>&#151;That the Parliament opposes the introduction 
            of any technical measures for the scallop fishing industry that would 
            include a weekend ban; believes that such a ban (a), if geographically 
            confined, will cause major displacement problems, (b) will produce 
            no conservation benefit, as those who do not already work a five-day 
            week work two 10-day trips a month, which amounts to the same fishing 
            effort, and (c) will disrupt supplies to processors, who rely on continuity 
            of supply, and thereby will threaten continued access to the lucrative 
            Spanish market, particularly the weekend market for which a premium 
            price is presently enjoyed, and notes that, in contrast to the lack 
            of any contribution of a weekend ban to effective conservation measures, 
            measures that would make a real and significant contribution to conservation 
            have been proposed and developed by the Scallop Association and the 
            Mallaig and North West Fishermans Association, which would enhance 
            conservation whilst allowing the industry to remain viable.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-89#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Rural Rail Services</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that the contract to operate Scotland&#146;s 
            internal rail services over the next seven years is shortly to be 
            awarded; recognises that the provision of affordable, reliable and 
            regular rail services across all of the Scottish network is important 
            to the social and economic well-being of communities, and believes 
            that, in considering the tender proposals offered by the competing 
            train operators, the vital needs of communities served by rural lines 
            should not be forgotten.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-88#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Minch Moor</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the concerns of local people, hill-walkers and 
            ramblers about the application by AMEC Ltd to locate a wind farm at 
            Minch Moor, near Innerleithen and Walkerburn in the Scottish Borders, 
            an area designated by Scottish Borders Council in its 1995 Structure 
            Plan as a &quot;preferred area of search&quot; for wind farms; further 
            notes that the application concerns the erection of 14 turbines some 
            100 metres high, with at least seven of the turbines being visible 
            from Walkerburn and three being directly adjacent to part of the Southern 
            Upland Way; is aware that, as yet, there is no indication from AMEC 
            Ltd on how and where the power lines will run; shares the local, national 
            and international concern that this unspoiled countryside, including 
            the skyline defined by Priesthope Hill and Windlestraw Law, will be 
            blemished should this development proceed; further shares concerns 
            that tourism in this economically vulnerable area will suffer, and 
            therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should review its 
            planning policy on the proliferation of wind farms and examine planning 
            policy elsewhere in Europe, in particular Germany, Netherlands and 
            Denmark, with the purpose of developing a proactive national planning-led 
            approach to the location of wind farms.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-87#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Relocation of 
            European Maritime Safety Agency to Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament notes that the European Maritime Safety Agency is due to 
            relocate from Brussels to elsewhere in the European Union; further 
            notes the long-standing and rich sea-going heritage and ongoing business 
            interests of both Glasgow and Scotland in the maritime sector, and 
            considers that the Scottish Executive, and all relevant bodies, should 
            take all possible steps to have the agency located in Glasgow.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-86#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard: Proposals for the 
            Future of Europe</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the proposals 
            by the Convention on the Future of Europe for an EU constitution and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should conduct a consultative 
            public referendum on such proposals.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-65.1</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Reduction in 
            Services at Vale of Leven General Hospital</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
            to motion (S2M-65) in the name of Frances Curran, <a name="AmendmentText">leave 
            out from &quot;elderly&quot; to end and insert &quot;services at the 
            Vale of Leven Hospital caused by a combination of the increasing specialisation 
            of staff, particularly in surgery, the inability of Argyll and Clyde 
            NHS Board to attract staff to the area and the demands of Royal College 
            guidelines; further notes the contingency arrangements in place for 
            the provision of maternity services, in partnership with the Queen 
            Mother's Hospital, Glasgow, and for accident and emergency services; 
            welcomes the forthcoming return of maternity services delivered through 
            a midwife-led unit and the prospect of returning full orthopaedic 
            surgery to the Vale of Leven Hospital; recognises the deep concern 
            of local people at the gradual erosion of services and, in particular, 
            at the recent announcement by Argyll and Clyde NHS Board of changes 
            to the accident and emergency service; urges the Scottish Executive 
            to review all the circumstances that led to the decision, and believes 
            that the acute services review, due to be launched in the summer, 
            provides a real opportunity to deliver sustainable and improved healthcare 
            for the future."</a> </p>

            the Parliament notes the longstanding need for a new secondary school 
            at the Tay Bridgehead in north-east Fife; is aware of widespread local 
            community support in the area for such a school; believes that the 
            school is vital to relieve pressure on Madras College, St Andrews, 
            which is the second largest secondary school in Scotland with a pupil 
            roll of 1,850 and on Bell Baxter High School, Cupar, *and* further 
            notes that the relocation of an additional squadron to RAF Leuchars 
            will increase the pressure on the existing secondary schools and exacerbate 
            the current situation.*</p>
