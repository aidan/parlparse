      <p ALIGN="left">S1M-610 David McLetchie: </b>European Convention on Human Rights&#151;That
      the Parliament notes with concern the disruption to Scotland&#146;s judicial system
      resulting from Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s decision to directly incorporate the
      European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into Scots Law without having paid due
      attention to the consequences; further notes that the Convention now impacts directly upon
      the legislative competence of the Parliament and the powers of the Scottish Executive and
      from October 2000 will apply to all public authorities in Scotland; calls upon the
      Scottish Executive to provide, at the earliest opportunity, a full report to the
      Parliament on the impact of incorporation to date and a statement on the Executive&#146;s
      state of preparedness for October when the Convention becomes fully operational, and
      further calls upon the Scottish Executive to provide a full and detailed analysis of the
      ECHR implications of legislative proposals submitted to the Parliament and to consider
      establishing a Human Rights Commission or some other body to provide expert advice and
      guidance on the impact of the ECHR on public authorities in Scotland.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>

      concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the obligation to comply with the European
      Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) has existed since 1951; appreciates that the Scotland
      Act 1998 together with the Human Rights Act 1998 will enable Scots to enforce their basic
      human rights in their own courts; notes that substantial training on the ECHR has been
      provided for the main justice agencies and that detailed guidance has been sent to public
      authorities; notes that the Scottish Executive will be considering the possibility of
      establishing a Scottish Human Rights Commission; and further notes that if it is
      considered necessary to do so, proposals for legislation will be brought forward in due
      course.<b><i> </p>
