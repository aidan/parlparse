<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">current motions</a> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8137 Margo MacDonald: Count Me In Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the five principles adopted by the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils in Scotland for its Count Me In Campaign for the Scottish Parliament election; commends the principles on which the campaign is based - to deliver a skilled workforce, to put employers at the heart of the skills system, to ensure that high quality advice and information is available to deliver a skilled workforce and to widen access to apprenticeships and vocational qualifications, and acknowledges that these constitute a means whereby skills will be developed and prospects for employment improved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8136 Rhoda Grant: Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8135 Robert Brown: Handling of Asylum Claims in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes <em>21 Months Later</em>, a report by the British Red Cross (BRC) and the Refugee Survival Trust (RST), which highlights the plight of people who have to travel from Scotland to Croydon to register claims for asylum without receiving financial help for this from the UK Government; notes that the BRC and RST pay for food and overnight bus travel for the claimants; further notes that the BRC and RST are calling on the UK Border Agency to meet the travel costs for people making these trips of approximately 400 miles to register their claims, and considers that asylum seekers housed in Scotland should have the right to lodge and have their claims dealt with in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8134 Bob Doris: Strictly for Charity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Scottish Enterprise is hosting its annual (A Little Less) Strictly Come Dancing fundraiser on Saturday 2 April 2011 with all proceeds going to the Prince &amp; Princess of Wales Hospice in Glasgow, which it considers provides a first class, free service for patients and families, supporting them with dignity during distressing times; notes that six couples from the worlds of celebrity and business will compete with their Scottish professional partners; notes that contestants will include the actress, Kathleen McDermott Carberry, Clyde 1&rsquo;s Romeo, Scottish footballer Gordon Smith, Scottish event rider Nicola Malcolm and Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise Lena Wilson; believes this to be a worthwhile cause, and urges the public to support it by donating one pound by texting the name of the dancer whom they wish to support to 70100 on 2 April.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-8120.1 Michael McMahon: Local Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8120) in the name of Robert Brown, leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the case for reform and innovation in Scotland&rsquo;s public services is unanswerable and that meeting the needs of the public is more important than preserving structures; recognises that the need to protect frontline services in the face of UK Government cuts requires the status quo in public services to be reassessed; believes that moving to a single fire and rescue service, a single police service and the creation of a national care service offers the best opportunity for improving delivery of these services in Scotland, and believes that these new structures will allow the reinvestment of savings to maintain frontline staff while ensuring that there are improved mechanisms for local democratic accountability and delivery on local priorities.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-8114.1 Fiona Hyslop: Scotland Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-8114) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from first &quot;the Bill&quot; to end and insert &quot;Scotland is best served by a Scottish Parliament that has the full range of powers and responsibilities necessary to improve Scotland&rsquo;s economic performance and promote sustainable economic growth; agrees that the current provisions of the Scotland Bill do not provide those powers and responsibilities; recognises the improvements to the Bill suggested by the Scotland Bill Committee but is of the view that further improvements are needed to provide the financial responsibility that Scotland needs and to address other flaws in the Bill; nevertheless agrees that the UK Parliament should consider the Bill, apart from the provisions that reserve insolvency and the regulation of health professions (clauses 12 and 13) and allow UK ministers to implement international obligations in devolved areas (clause 23) and partial suspension of Acts subject to scrutiny by the Supreme Court (clause 7), and further agrees that, given the amendments requested by the Scottish Parliament, the incoming Scottish Parliament should consider the Bill as amended by the UK Parliament in a further legislative consent motion before the Bill is passed for Royal Assent.&quot;</p>
