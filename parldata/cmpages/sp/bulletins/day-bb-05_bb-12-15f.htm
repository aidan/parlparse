<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3741</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Animal Welfare Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the principle of reciprocal recognition of court orders in relation to animal welfare and agrees that the relevant provisions of the Animal Welfare Bill, introduced into the House of Commons on 13 October 2005, so far as they relate to matters within the legislative competence of the Parliament, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3740</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Right to Peaceful Protest</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Edinburgh University Students&rsquo; Association President, Ruth Cameron, has won a competition organised by WWF, ice-cream makers Ben and Jerry, and polar explorer, Marc Cornelissen, to become an international speaker on climate change; further notes that Ms Cameron beat more than 1,000 other candidates from across Europe to win one of the six places at the &quot;Climate Change College&quot;; congratulates Ms Cameron on her success, and wishes her well at her training session in Greenland in the spring.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3739</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Home Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that some local education authorities in Scotland are not adhering to the statutory guidance on the circumstances in which parents may choose to educate their children at home which was issued by the Scottish Executive in March 2004 with the aim of improving relationships between local authorities and home-educating families; notes that, while the majority of councils have changed their policies, procedures and practices to reflect the statutory guidance, many others have delayed or refused consent to parents wishing to withdraw their children from school, despite those parents having provided adequate information about their home-based education provision; notes that in England and Wales the law allows for the deregistration of a pupil from any school upon written demand, whereas in Scotland parents require council consent to remove their child from a state, but not a private, school; commends the majority of councils in Scotland for engaging positively with home-educating families and making the guidance work, and supports Schoolhouse and the home education community in Scotland in their call for an amendment to section 35 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 so that children attending state schools in Scotland may be withdrawn from state schools upon written notification to the local authority.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3738</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Establishment of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to establish a committee of the Parliament as follows: </p>
<p>Name of Committee: Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Bill Committee;</p>
<p>Remit: To consider the Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Bill at Stage 2;</p>
<p>Duration: Until the Bill is passed, or falls or is otherwise no longer in progress; </p>
<p>Convenership: The Convener will be a member of the Scottish National Party and the Deputy Convener will be a member of the Labour Party; </p>
<p>Membership:  Susan Deacon and Margaret Jamieson (Labour), Mrs Margaret Ewing (SNP), Mr Jamie McGrigor (Conservative), Mike Rumbles (Liberal Democrat).</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3737</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Tackling Child Obesity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is shocked by the new figures indicating that one third of children in Scotland are overweight; notes that the figures are constantly increasing; believes that free healthy school meals for all of Scotland&rsquo;s children would be a major weapon in the battle to promote healthy eating and to establish healthy eating habits from a young age; notes that time is not on our side and that Finland implemented this policy over 20 years ago and saw huge health improvements within a generation, and considers that Scotland has no time to lose.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3736</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Iraq: 1,000 Days Under Occupation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the passing of the 1,000th day since the invasion of Iraq by US and British military forces on 20 March 2003; notes that, despite President Bush declaring that major hostilities were over on 1 May 2003, 183,000 British and American troops remain in action at the end of 2005; further notes that the United States of America has spent over $204 billion on the war so far but has totally failed in its promise to reconstruct Iraq after the war; recognises that the biggest issue facing Iraqis today is personal safety, with criminal gangs and death squads bringing a complete breakdown in law and order; notes that many Iraqis who initially welcomed the overthrow of Saddam Hussein have been humiliated and brutalised by the occupying forces who have conducted full body searches of Muslim women in front of men and in their own bedrooms, have entered mosques without removing their boots, have used mass arrests of young men and held them without charge for months on end and have routinely used torture in prisons such as Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca; further notes reports from Iraq that show that the occupying forces are using air strikes, tanks and artillery against civilian targets, including the use of white phosphorus during the actions in Fallujah, which have been described as war crimes; believes that it is the actions of the US and British military forces that are driving Iraqis to resist the occupation politically, physically and through trade union action; notes the magnificent work of Iraqi non-governmental organisations, such as International Peace Angels, who bring medical and humanitarian aid to Iraqis who find themselves caught up in the fighting, and believes that the situation in Iraq can come to a positive outcome if the occupying forces are withdrawn immediately and Iraqis are able to determine the future of their country, free from foreign occupation.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3735&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Closure of Six Post Offices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern over Post Office Ltd&rsquo;s announcement that it will be closing six town centre post offices, including the main post office in Dumfries, replacing them with franchises in SPAR shops; notes that SPAR itself is a franchise; is concerned over the implications for staff numbers and terms and conditions of employment; believes that in cases such as Dumfries the new location is less convenient for customers; further believes that the proposed arrangements may not offer a sustainable and long-term future for these post offices; expresses concern that the announcement was made less than two weeks before Christmas and considers that Post Office Ltd should extend the consultation period beyond the current seven weeks to ensure that all customers get the opportunity to express their views, and believes that no irreversible decisions should be made without paying full consideration and attention to the views of customers and staff.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3734</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Central Heating</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the coming winter is predicted to be one of the coldest in recent years; further notes that many pensioners and people on low incomes in Scotland have already had their central heating systems upgraded, paid for and installed as part of the Warm Deal and the central heating programme but is concerned that a significant number of people are having to wait many months for inspections, surveys or work relating to the schemes to be carried out; believes that at least some of the delays are due to work only being able to be carried out by companies approved and contracted to Eaga Partnership Ltd and further believes that more work could be carried out by local contractors, thus reducing some of the waiting times, and calls on the Scottish Executive to look at the possibility of local companies playing a larger role in installations and also in the delivery of the scheme in general to ensure that those entitled elderly or vulnerable people in Scotland get the heating system they desperately need.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3694#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Scotland for Sanitation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Homeless International and the Scottish Homeless International Action Group on the launch of the Scotland for Sanitation Appeal on 6 December 2005, which has been formed to support community-led sanitation initiatives in Asia and Africa, and welcomes the fundraising and consciousness-raising participation of housing providers and agencies for this appeal.</p>
