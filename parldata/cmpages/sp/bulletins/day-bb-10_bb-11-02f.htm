<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7310 Sarah Boyack: Edinburgh University Settlement Declares Bankruptcy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Edinburgh University Settlement has ceased operations after running up debts of more than &pound;300,000; is concerned that this will result in 40 members of staff being made redundant and over 200 learners having their courses withdrawn; notes that the majority of these learners are from disadvantaged backgrounds, are disabled or have English as a second language; further notes that Edinburgh University Settlement provided these groups with a range of services including adult and community education, employment and vocational training projects and support for people coping with mental health issues, and urges support from all stakeholders involved in Edinburgh University Settlement to work to ensure that the services provided by the projects are continued to the benefit of users.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7309 Patricia Ferguson: Fireworks in Maryhill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success of the Maryhill Winter Festival and congratulates Maryhill Community Council for what it considers its hard work and creativity in making this event such a success; recognises the contribution of all those who took part in the Halloween Costume competition; congratulates the winners in the various age categories, and considers that the excellent fireworks display provided an appropriate climax to the day.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7308 Christina McKelvie: The Return of The Street</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Regen:fx Youth Trust in Hamilton&rsquo;s immersive drama project, <em>The Street</em>, is scheduled to return for a month-long run from 15 November 2010; understands that <em>The Street</em> combines hard-hitting theatre performance with youth work and education to explore topics including vandalism, bullying and intimidation, substance abuse, sexual health, knife crime, personal safety and domestic violence; further notes that the project not only works with targeted groups of young people who have been identified as being at particular risk of becoming involved in crime but also that the drama is performed by young people who have themselves previously participated in the project; believes that this model of peer-to-peer discussion, backed up by strong professional support, which challenges harmful behaviour by young people, highlighting the consequences of their actions and encourages them to question their life choices, is an effective way of communicating with at-risk young people; further believes that this model has the potential to reduce offending by young people in communities across Scotland, and commends the work of Hamilton&rsquo;s Regen:fx Youth Trust and all those involved in this innovative project.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7307 Linda Fabiani: East Kilbride Folk Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends good wishes for the success of the first ever East Kilbride Folk Festival, which is scheduled to take place from 5 to 7 November 2010; notes that the festival line-up includes a wealth of musical talent from the town of East Kilbride itself as well as traditional and folk singers and musicians from across Scotland; is delighted at the involvement of children from St Vincent&rsquo;s and Crosshouse primary schools in East Kilbride, who have written songs to be performed during the festival; notes that ticket prices have been kept at what it considers to be a very affordable level and that entry to many sessions will be free; believes that this will enable the widest possible range of people to enjoy the festival, and looks forward to the East Kilbride Folk festival becoming a permanent fixture in Scotland&rsquo;s traditional arts calendar in years to come.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7301 Christina McKelvie: Equal Pay Day, 2 November</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2 November 2010 is Equal Pay Day in the United Kingdom; further considers that this date is significant because the full-time pay gap between women and men is equivalent to men being paid all the year round while women work for free after 2 November; further notes that 40 years after the Equal Pay Act women working full-time in the UK are still paid on average 16.4% less per hour than men; believes that equal pay is a fundamental right; calls on the UK Government, in the 40th anniversary year of the Equal Pay Act, to step up action to close the gender pay gap once and for all, and fully supports the national day of action on 2 November to fight for equal pay for women.</p>
