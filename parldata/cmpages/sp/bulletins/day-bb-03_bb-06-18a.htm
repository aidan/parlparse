          <p><strong>S2M-154</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Patient 
            Focus and Public Involvement in the NHS</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the measures in <em>Partnership For Care: Scotland&#146;s 
            Health White Paper</em> and the Partnership Agreement to step up progress 
            to ensure that greater patient engagement and wider public involvement 
            are at the heart of a modernised NHS and supports the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
            commitment to placing the patient at the heart of the design of services, 
            implementing a patient information initiative, ensuring public involvement 
            in health service reorganisation plans by obliging NHS boards to consult 
            stakeholders more effectively and setting up a Scottish health council 
            as a national body with a local presence across Scotland</p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-154.1</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Patient Focus and 
            Public Involvement in the NHS</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion

            and Public Involvement in the NHS</strong>&#151;As an amendment to 
            motion (S2M-154) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;regrets that the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
            proposal in <em>Partnership for Care: Scotland&#146;s Health White 
            Paper </em>and<em> A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em>, in an 
            attempt to increase patient focus and public involvement, will only 
            increase bureaucracy in an over centralised NHS and considers measures 
            such as GP fundholding and foundation hospitals would offer patients 
            real choice regarding their own care and would focus on clinical priorities 
            over political priorities, and would, therefore, start to solve the 
            real problems facing the health service.&quot;</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-59</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> 
            <strong>Concorde and the Museum of Flight</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that British Airways will be withdrawing Concorde aircraft from 
            service and welcomes the approach from the Chairman of the Trustees 
            of the National Museums of Scotland to the Chief Executive of British 
            Airways requesting that one of these aeroplanes is donated to the 
            Museum of Flight at East Fortune; recognises the interests of education 
            and tourism and the important role that museums play in both of these 
            areas; takes into account the associations of Concorde with Scotland, 
            namely that the design of the wings was undertaken by a Scot from 
            Penicuik, Sir James Arnot Hamilton, that the early test flights were 
            carried out at Prestwick in the early 1970s and that it was Concorde 
            that flew over Edinburgh to celebrate the opening of the Scottish 
            Parliament in July 1999; further recognises the wealth of experience 
            of staff at the Museum of Flight in the preservation of aircraft and 
            their years of experience in welcoming visitors to the museum; further 
            notes that staff at the Museum of Flight are confident that the practicalities 
            of landing a Concorde aircraft and of providing enclosed space for 
            display have been investigated and that no difficulties are anticipated 
            following a brief period of minor works; notes that the National Museums 
            of Scotland has recently appointed a new General Manager at the Museum 
            of Flight and that a major programme of development is planned to 
            position the museum as a world class attraction, and recommends strongly 
            that support be given to the National Museums of Scotland in its bid 
            for Concorde for display at the Museum of Flight.</p>
