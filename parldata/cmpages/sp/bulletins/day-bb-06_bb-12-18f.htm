<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5343</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Inappropriate Proposals to Regulate Psychology Profession</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the deep concerns of psychologists about proposals by the Department of Health to use the Health Professions Council as a single regulatory body for all psychologists; contends that the proposals are entirely inappropriate when 60% of psychologists do not work in the health service and that many will not be regulated, particularly in Scotland; further contends that the proposals will not deliver the stronger public protection and the high professional standards required for the practice of psychology; recognises the work of the nine organisations representing psychology in seeking an agreement on alternative proposals in discussions with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government and the Scottish Executive, and strongly urges the UK Government and the Executive not to introduce any legislative instruments on this issue until such agreement is reached.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5342</strong> <strong>Mr Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>ScottishPower Learning</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 10th anniversary of ScottishPower&rsquo;s ambitious initiative, ScottishPower Learning, designed to deliver training and learning opportunities for people living in our local communities; also notes that, since its launch in 1996, ScottishPower Learning has developed a successful range of programmes to increase young people&rsquo;s skills and employability, and congratulates the 12,000 young people who have benefited from these training and education programmes.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5341</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>The Draft Scottish Local Government Elections Order 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that the draft Scottish Local Government Elections Order 2007 be approved.</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5333</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Aboyne Maternity Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Minister for Health and Community Care to reject proposals from NHS Grampian to close rural maternity units at Aboyne, Fraserburgh and Banff; congratulates members of the Save Aboyne Maternity (SAM) campaign and other campaigners on the positive way that they have resisted NHS Grampian&rsquo;s proposals, and calls on NHS Grampian to work with local people to develop alternative options for birth units at Aboyne, Fraserburgh and Banff.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5332#</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Neighbourhood Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates East Ayrshire Council and NHS Ayrshire and Arran on the establishment of the North West Kilmarnock Primary Care Neighbourhood Services Centre, an ambitious multi-agency partnership project delivering world-class public services for local communities through the co-location of interconnected public bodies at a single site where those who need them most can access them, exemplifying the practice of building public services around the people who use them.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5331</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>EU REACH Legislation on Toxic Chemicals in Manufacturing and Products</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the European Parliament has approved the EU Council&rsquo;s Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) legislation on the regulation of toxic chemicals in the environment; is concerned at reports of intense lobbying at EU level by chemicals industries and the watering down of initial proposals, including those for the substitution of the most hazardous chemicals; is concerned that chemicals that cause cancer, reproductive disorders, birth defects and hormonal disturbances will continue be used in manufacturing and in consumer goods, despite the availability of safer alternatives; is concerned that there will be an increase in testing chemicals on animals; is concerned that, since the chemicals industry can continue to invoke commercial confidentiality, consumers will continue to have &quot;no right to know&quot; which chemicals are contained in products; recognises that legal loopholes and provisions for self-regulation contained in the new measures leave REACH open to the possibility of manipulation by chemicals industries; believes that the development and work of a new EU chemicals agency in Helsinki must be completely independent of the chemicals industry and closely monitored during implementation of REACH to ensure that the presence of toxic chemicals in the environment is reduced to minimise contamination of people and wildlife, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use its influence at UK and EU level to ensure that this is achieved.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5330</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Discrimination Doesn&rsquo;t Work</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of disability charity, Leonard Cheshire, which recently conducted research into discrimination in recruitment in Scotland; further notes that the report shows that many disabled people still face discrimination in the labour market and that employers were twice as likely to discriminate in favour of a non-disabled applicant; agrees with Leonard Cheshire that there needs to be further research conducted into this issue to develop new ways of engaging with employers to find positive and pro-active ways to reverse the findings of this report, and urges all MSPs to raise awareness of the issues raised by Leonard Cheshire among their constituents, especially local employers, to ensure that equality prevails in Scotland&rsquo;s employment markets.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5329</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Label Scotch in Gaelic</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that&nbsp;EU institutions are currently dealing with a legislative proposal aimed at updating European rules relating to the labelling of spirit drinks; further notes that under the proposal legal recognition is given to the terms &quot;Irish Whiskey&quot; and &quot;Uisce Beatha Eireannach/Irish Whiskey&quot;; considers that it would be appropriate for the Scottish Gaelic term &quot;Uisge-beatha Albannach&quot; to be given similar protection as is already afforded to its Irish equivalent, particularly given the recent legislation giving Gaelic official status in Scots law, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to work alongside the whisky industry, Gaelic language bodies and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to ensure that full EU legal status is given to Scotland&rsquo;s national drink in our national languages.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5328</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Betting Shop Staff Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that betting shops are among the few high street establishments in which cash handling is growing; further notes that, as a result, staff in Scottish betting shops are subject to risk of robbery and assault on a daily basis; believes that this risk is significantly increased due to longer opening hours and single-staffing of betting shops; notes that, in a survey of betting shop staff by Community, the union representing UK betting shop staff, 78% reported that they were concerned that they would become a victim of crime at work, and therefore welcomes the campaign recently launched by Community to end single-staffing and improve security in betting shops.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5327</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Bring Back Our Buses Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that several vital community bus services in the Edinburgh area have been cut or made virtually unaffordable through fare increases over the last year; applauds the efforts of the South Queensferry Bus Users&rsquo; Group in campaigning for affordable fares and of the &quot;Bring Back our Buses&quot; campaign in calling for the retention of frequent services on the 13, 18, 38 routes and the reinstatement of full services on the 67, 20 and 60 routes, which are much used by OAPs and other vulnerable members of excluded communities in Blackhall, Ratho, Dumbiedykes, Wester Hailes and Pilton, and believes that local authorities should be allowed to regulate bus routes and timetables to ensure that marginalised communities are able to access services and amenities.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5326</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Shelter - Homeless Children at Christmas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern Shelter Scotland&rsquo;s estimate that almost 5,000 children will be in temporary accommodation this Christmas and that, despite a three-year-old Scottish Executive pledge, reported in the <em>Daily Record</em>, that there would be no homeless children in bed and breakfast hotels at Christmas, there are still councils using unsuitable accommodation for children at this time of year.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5322</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>Peace Process in the Basque Country</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the current initiative to bring a democratic conclusion to the political conflict in the Basque country and urges all participants to overcome the current impasse and move forward to direct talks at the earliest opportunity, for the sake of peace, progress and democracy.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5321</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulation to Nuclear Free Local Authorities on Vote to Abolish Nuclear Weapons</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Nuclear Free Local Authorities on its annual general meeting vote to call for the abolition of UK nuclear weapons and the redirection of resources to support the development of public services and tackle climate change that was passed unanimously on 7 December 2006; notes that the resolution agreed with the report of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission,<em> Weapons of Terror</em>, which stated that &quot;Nuclear, biological and chemical arms are the most inhumane of all weapons. Designed to terrify as well as destroy, they can, in the hands of either states or non-state actors, cause destruction on a vastly greater scale than any conventional weapons, and their impact is far more indiscriminate and long-lasting. So long as any state has such weapons - especially nuclear arms - others will want them. So long as any such weapons remain in any state&rsquo;s arsenal, there is a high risk that they will one day be used, by design or accident. Any such use would be catastrophic&quot;; agrees with the report&rsquo;s statement that &quot;Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations and non government actors should commence preparations for a World Summit on disarmament, non-proliferation and terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction to generate new momentum for concerted international action&quot;, and therefore supports Nuclear Free Local Authorities&rsquo; call for the Westminster Government to (a) give support to a world summit, (b) signal its resolve to strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation regime by terminating any further work on a replacement for Trident and (c) announce an early date to withdraw the Trident fleet from active service and shares its support for all lawful campaign action in the United Kingdom to secure support for no Trident replacement and its support for the work of international Mayors for Peace and endorses its 2020 Vision campaign that calls for international agreement by 2010 on a nuclear weapons convention to dismantle nuclear weapons by 2020.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5319</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander on behalf of the Finance Committee:</strong> <strong>Report on Stage 2 of the 2007-08 Budget Process</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 9th Report, 2006 (Session 2) of the Finance Committee, <em>Stage 2 of the 2007-08 Budget Process</em> (SP Paper 695) and refers the report and its recommendations to the Scottish Executive for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5317</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Make Women Safe - Stop Male Violence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply concerned by the discovery of five women&rsquo;s bodies in the Ipswich area and offers its condolences to the friends and families of the murdered women, Tania Nicol, Gemma Adams and Anneli Alderton and of Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls who are currently missing, noting that all are, first and foremost, women, daughters, sisters, mothers and friends who may have been murdered by a predator who has preyed on their vulnerability as women abused through prostitution; is appalled that violence against women is endemic in our society and manifested most brutally in such murders; recognises that in Scotland many murders of women remain unsolved and believes that society and all agencies must take responsibility for bringing the perpetrators to justice and making women safe from male violence against them; believes that society, government and all agencies must work towards the eradication of abuse of women through prostitution and the harm it causes; believes that protection for women must be increased in the short term and that vulnerable women, many of whom are addicted to drugs, must be given the support and services needed within the NHS including, importantly, prescribed medications such as the Diamorphine substitute for heroin, in order to remove their need to raise money through prostitution and to ensure their safety; expresses concern about some public and media statements that place the responsibility on women to avoid being murdered rather than on those men who perpetrate the violence; believes that telling women to be safe when they have little control over poverty, drug and alcohol addictions and mental health issues is an abdication of responsibility; further believes that there should be an amnesty for all women involved in prostitution so that they can seek and access services free from fear and that there should be a zero tolerance approach to the men who buy the use of women&rsquo;s orifices and who are violent to women and that the emphasis of the discourse on these issues must switch to the swift identification of men who present a risk to women rather than on the lifestyles of women; calls on women and men throughout the country to unite against men&rsquo;s violence against women, and calls on government to ensure that all agencies and services have adequate resources to make and keep women safe, believing that women should have the right to go about their lives free from fear.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5315</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Regulation of Local Bus Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Westminster Government is currently examining proposals to grant local authorities greater regulatory powers over local bus companies; believes that traffic congestion will continue to grow until such time as local authorities have at least the same powers as the Mayor of London to regulate timetables and fares, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward legislation to give local authorities the powers that they need to regulate public transport and ensure that services are based on need and not profit.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5307</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Support for Prescribing of Tysabri for MS Sufferers in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) that Tysabri should not be prescribed on the NHS; further notes that Scotland has the highest proportion of sufferers from multiple sclerosis in the world, that the SMC accepts that the clinical case for the use of Tysabri was sound and that the recommendation not to prescribe it on the NHS was taken on purely financial grounds, and therefore urges that this decision by the SMC be overturned and that Tysabri be made available on the NHS.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5306</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Quality of Life for MS sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has decided not to recommend the drug Tysabri as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, despite it being highly effective for certain patients, leading to a 60% to 70% reduction in relapses; notes that Tysabri is a licensed drug approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and SMC only provides advice to NHS boards and their area drug and therapeutics committees across Scotland; notes also that health professionals are expected to take due account of this recommendation when exercising their clinical judgement but that this recommendation does not, however, override the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, and calls on all NHS boards to acknowledge that clinicians must be able to prescribe this treatment where they believe there is a clinical need, regardless of SMC advice to them.</p>
