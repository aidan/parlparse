<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3798</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Possible Suspension of Sri Lanka from the Commonwealth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the continuing violence of the Sri Lankan military towards the Tamils and calls for a peaceful solution; welcomes the fact that Westminster is holding a House of Commons debate on Sri Lanka, and supports Labour MP Joan Ryan&rsquo;s calls for Sri Lanka to be suspended from the Commonwealth if the Sri Lankan Government does not respond to calls for a ceasefire.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3797</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Curbing Pay Excesses While Sustaining Tax Revenues</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the remarks by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rt Hon Alistair Darling MP, that the UK Government is keen to take action on excessive remuneration in the financial sector but is concerned that a strict ceiling would leave a black hole in tax revenues; believes that this concern could be addressed if more was done by the UK Government to eradicate tax havens and close tax loopholes, its actions potentially including the lobbying of global institutions and other governments; suggests that the UK Government should impose on financial institutions, and potentially on others, a maximum ratio of earnings, including bonuses and share options, of their best-paid employees to the earnings of their worst-paid employees, and believes that this would make for a more stable economy and a more equal society, with considerable benefits for UK society as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3796</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>The NHS and the Independent Sector</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of the Scottish Regional Treatment Centre at Stracathro and pays tribute to the previous Scottish administration for piloting the scheme; notes that the Stracathro pilot was rated as excellent by its patients and has reduced waiting times, that the centre has no reported healthcare associated infections and that it has saved several million pounds of taxpayers&rsquo; money in the process of successfully treating NHS patients; further notes that since 1999 successive Scottish administrations have recognised the contribution that can be made by the independent sector to treating NHS patients, with a record 4,409 treatments performed in 2008, more than double the level in 1999 and a 38% increase since 2007, and accordingly urges the Scottish Government to continue to work with the independent sector in order to deliver the best possible healthcare for the people of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3795</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Danestone Primary School Considerate Cars Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates primary 5 of Danestone Primary School in Aberdeen on the launch of its Considerate Cars Campaign, on the 25 March 2009, which is designed to alleviate the problems caused by inappropriate and inconsiderate car parking close to the school gates and, through encouraging the practice of sharing lifts and safe parking as well as promoting walking or cycling to school, to reduce the danger to pupils and make the roads around the school a safe place for children.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3794</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Government Code for the Welfare of Equidae</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Scottish Government Code of Practice for the Welfare of Equidae (SG 2009/20) be approved.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3778</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Alcohol Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Scottish Government to incorporate its proposals for reform of the law relating to the sale of alcohol into a new health Bill, which will facilitate democratic accountability and greater parliamentary and public scrutiny of its proposals; calls on the Scottish Government to place greater emphasis on a much more rigorous application of the existing licensing laws and to recognise that any changes can be introduced only on the basis of a wider and meaningful consultation with the licensed trade and Scotland&rsquo;s communities, and believes that any measures taken to tackle binge drinking and underage drinking must be properly targeted and effective so that the responsible, sensible majority of moderate drinkers do not have to pay more or suffer as a result of the excesses of a small minority.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3777</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Protecting Tenancy Deposits in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the research, <em>Review of the Private Rented Sector</em>; notes that the size of the private rented sector includes approximately 233,000 households with 74% of these households paying a tenancy deposit of, on average, &pound;433; further notes that tenancy deposits therefore amount to over &pound;70 million and that the research found that 13% of these deposits are withheld; highlights that the research estimates that up to 19,000 tenants in Scotland believe that they have had a deposit withheld unfairly, with these withheld deposits totalling up to &pound;6 million; believes that tenancy deposits in Scotland are currently inadequately regulated; considers that there is a successful tenancy deposit protection scheme operating in England and Wales; recognises that there are powers provided by statute as part of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 to introduce a tenancy deposit protection scheme; considers that there is support among the National Union of Students, Shelter and many other organisations for such a tenancy deposit protection scheme, and calls on the Scottish Government to introduce at the earliest opportunity a tenancy deposit protection scheme to protect tenants and good landlords alike from rogue private landlords.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3776</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Kittybrewster Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the staff and pupils at Kittybrewster Primary School following the publication of the HM Inspectorate of Education report; welcomes the progress that has been made by the school, the leadership of the headteacher in taking forward improvements and the strong commitment of staff to improving children&rsquo;s learning; recognises the importance of confidence in the future of the school on the part of pupils, families and staff, and believes that the achievements of Kittybrewster School would best be recognised by an undertaking from Aberdeen City Council that the threat of closure faced by the school twice in the last two years will not be repeated.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3775</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Combating Graffiti</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that graffiti not only reduces the appearance of many communities in Scotland but also has a definite adverse effect on the morale of people seeing it in their areas and congratulates the work carried out by Glasgow Community and Safety Services to clear graffiti from walls and street furniture, greatly improving the quality of life for Glasgow citizens.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3773</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Capital Punishment and the EU</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern over the alarming figures published by Amnesty International showing that in 2008 at least 2,390 people were executed by states across the globe, including China, the United States of America and Japan, compared to 1,252 in 2007; believes that capital punishment, which includes beheadings, electrocutions, hangings, lethal injections, shootings and stonings, is the most inhumane form of punishment and has no place in the 21st century; notes that Belarus is the only country in Europe where executions still take place; further notes that the European Union (EU) is the only major global economic and political power where capital punishment is illegal and condemned, and calls on the EU as a major promoter of peace in the world to stand by its principles of respect for human dignity and strongly condemn all forms of capital punishment in Belarus and across the globe.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3744</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Post Bank</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposal for a new post bank to be run as part of the post office network that was launched on Tuesday 17 March 2009 by a coalition of trade unions, businesses, pensioner and pressure groups and charities; notes that the proposed model would strengthen the role of the post office network, making it more viable, creating new job opportunities and securing its role for the future; further notes that it would mark a return to the form of relationship banking abandoned by our biggest banks and ensure a stable source of finance in the heart of communities that could provide financial services to three million people still not using banks, including the most disadvantaged people, pensioners, people who live in very remote rural areas and the many small businesses that are looking for alternative sources of finance, of which two out of five would consider banking with a post bank; recognises that the post office network is a unique national resource on which communities, businesses and individuals depend, and believes that setting up a post bank provides a unique opportunity to answer both concerns around secure and equitable finance and the future of the post office network.</p>
