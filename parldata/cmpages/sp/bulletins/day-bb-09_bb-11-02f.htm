<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5100</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Ripped-off Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the decision to cancel the Glasgow Airport Rail Link is estimated to have cost 1,300 jobs in the city and has been criticised by CBI Scotland, Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and local community leaders who have described it as a dagger in the heart of Glasgow; notes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde this year received its worst funding settlement since devolution; notes that Glasgow does not receive a specific additional supplement to reflect the large number of non-residents who use its services; notes that, despite an increase in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s overall budget, it is cutting the housing and regeneration budget; believes that this decision, coupled with recent cuts to the Housing Association Grant, will disproportionately affect Glasgow; believes that local families and businesses in Glasgow deserve better, and urges the Scottish Government to give Glasgow a fair deal, not rip it off.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5099#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the West Highland Free Press</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>West Highland Free Press</em> (WHFP) on becoming Britain&rsquo;s first employee-owned newspaper; applauds the founders of the WHFP in practising what they preach both in their radical stewardship of the paper for the last 37 years and in their present support for this new form of ownership for the paper; recognises the significance of the WHFP since 1972 in informing and shaping political, cultural, social and community debate on issues close to the hearts of the people of the Highlands and Islands and across Scotland and in sustaining its commitment to its motto, An Tir, An Canan, sna&rsquo; Daoine - The Land, The Language, The People; wishes its new owners every success, and trusts that it will serve as an example to other businesses to develop employee ownership initiatives where possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5098#</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Save Lesmahagow&rsquo;s Jubilee Hall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern plans by South Lanarkshire Council to close and sell the Jubilee Hall in Lesmahagow; notes that this concern is shared by many members of the local community, the Community Council and various groups and users of the hall; believes that the Support the Jubilee Hall fun day, held by hall users on 31 October 2009, will further demonstrate the concern and opposition to the decision that exists locally, and considers that the hall continues to play an important function in Lesmahagow and is an important part of the town&rsquo;s heritage that should be preserved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5097</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Local Government Boundary Commission Decision to Keep Princes Gate in East Dunbartonshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the revised recommendations published by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland, proposing that Princes Gate housing estate in Bishopbriggs remain within East Dunbartonshire; notes that the revised recommendations will also retain the site to the rear of the Aldi supermarket designated for affordable housing, the loss of which would have had a detrimental effect on East Dunbartonshire Council&rsquo;s being able to make provision for affordable housing, allow children from Princes Gate the opportunity to continue their education with siblings and friends in East Dunbartonshire Council schools and allow children living in Princes Gate in receipt of special needs provision to continue to receive this from East Dunbartonshire Council social work services; congratulates the residents of Princes Gate for conducting a disciplined and determined campaign to get to this point, and hopes that all residents and elected representatives of Princes Gate residents in East Dunbartonshire Council, the Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament make representation to the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland prior to the close of consultation on 28 January 2010.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5094</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Better Value for Public Purse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Royal Mail on securing a &pound;17 million contract with the Scottish Government for postal services; notes that this is a contract across 89 Scottish public sector organisations, thus guaranteeing Royal Mail the custom from this wide range of bodies for the first time; considers that the delivery of this contract by Procurement Scotland will save the public purse nearly &pound;3 million per year, and further considers that the contract may help to protect the Royal Mail in the face of the hostility shown to it by the UK Government, including the deregulation of postal services nearly four years ago and epitomised by the comments of Pat McFadden MP in the House of Commons on 20 October 2009 that &quot;Competition exists in the postal service, and it will not go away and cannot be wished away. I want a Royal Mail that is fit to win in that market, rather than one that simply wishes competition to go away. The most fundamental challenge to Royal Mail is not competition from other mail companies but competition from other communications technologies. That must lie at the heart of the response to the threatened dispute.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5093&diams; </strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Tax Incentives Needed for Oil and Gas Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by TAQA Bratani that it has started production on its first new North Sea oil well in the Cormorant field and also welcomes the announcement of a discovery of light oil in the West of Shetland by Hurricane Exploration PLC, the first time that a basement reservoir has been planned and drilled in the UK continental shelf as an exploration target; believes that these excellent examples show that further investment in the UK continental shelf can produce rewards; however notes with concern recent comments from Oil and Gas UK that 50,000 jobs could be put at risk if tax incentives are not created to increase investment and that offshore platforms, pipelines and infrastructure would fall into disrepair, and would therefore welcome further tax incentives for the oil and gas industry to protect investment and jobs in the north east and help drive the economy out of this recession.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5086</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Impact on Fishermen of New Net-measuring Gauge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the problems that fishermen are encountering when the mesh sizes of their nets are found to be undersized when measured with the new electronic net-measuring gauge despite being measured as legal with the hand-held wedge-shaped device previously used by fisheries officers and that were in use when the nets were purchased; is further concerned that this can lead to expensive nets having to be discarded or to boats being arrested, resulting in a loss of valuable fishing time; believes that this is an unnecessary addition to the economic pressure on Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen who are already severely handicapped by the tight restrictions on their fishing opportunities; further believes that it is unacceptable for a formerly legal net to be deemed to be illegal because of a change in measuring device, and calls on the Scottish Government to introduce a transition period, during which fishermen can choose to have their old nets measured with the device in use when they were purchased, that will be long enough to allow fishermen to get the full use out of their old nets before discarding them.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5078</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Draconian Action against Filesharing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the poll findings published by YouGov that show that 70% of the UK public opposes plans to force internet service providers to disconnect customers suspected of filesharing; deeply regrets the enthusiasm being shown for these plans by the Secretary of State for Business, Lord Mandelson; considers that the proposal would lead to an increase in routine encryption, hijacking of internet protocol addresses and wi-fi networks, the unjustified disconnection of many individuals and a wider impact on other members of disconnected households; agrees with the UK All Party Parliamentary Communications Group that &quot;much of the problem with illegal sharing of copyrighted material has been caused by the rightsholders, and the music industry in particular, being far too slow in getting their act together and making popular legal alternatives available&quot;; recognises the growing importance, especially in rural areas, of reliable internet connections for access to public services, financial inclusion, education, democratic debate and other purposes, and urges the UK Government to abandon the current proposal and develop alternative approaches that properly balance creative artists&rsquo; right to fair recompense with the wider interests of the public.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5077</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Labour Silences Those Who Speak out against Organised Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the Labour-controlled Glasgow City Council appears to be gagging opposition councillors to prevent them from speaking out within the council against organised crime by refusing to allow a motion to be put forward in the names of Councillor McAllister and Councillor Greene; considers that the motion in question was to have been debated on Thursday 29 October 2009 at a full meeting of Glasgow City Council and would have allowed debate in relation to safety concerns at the Applerow Motors MOT testing centre in Lambhill in Glasgow, which was the scene of a gangland-style shooting in 2006; further considers that the motion would have exposed the lack of action by the Secretary of State for Transport, Lord Adonis, on this matter and the inability of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to deal with such matters; is disappointed that Glasgow&rsquo;s Lord Provost, Bob Winters, has called the motion not competent or relevant, and believes that this is an example of the Labour Party attempting to talk tough on crime but in reality attempting to silence those who are trying to take a stand and effect real action against organised criminals.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5053</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Biggar Little Festival 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the seventh Biggar Little Festival, which took place between 15 and 25 October 2009; notes the success of the wide range of cultural, musical and artistic events that made up the festival, including an appearance by Fred MacAulay, a lively concert by Koda, performances by Polish women&rsquo;s choir Canzona-Absolwent and a sold-out event with author Ian Rankin; further notes that, in the Year of Homecoming and the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns, the bard himself featured prominently in the programme, with Donald Kay from Ayr appearing as Burns to recite poetry and interact with visitors during the Biggar Day Out on Sunday 18 October, and looks forward to the festival continuing to go from strength to strength in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5052</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Chambers Harrap Publishers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the proposal by Hachette UK to close the Edinburgh headquarters of Chambers Harrap and transfer production of its profitable titles, such as <em>The Chambers Dictionary,</em> to London and Paris; is concerned that the closure would result in the loss of 27 jobs and end 200 years of publishing history in the city; believes that the iconic Chambers brand is closely connected to Edinburgh and that its loss will have serious consequences for the publishing industry in Scotland, and urges Hachette UK to reconsider its decision and explore all alternative avenues to retain the Chambers office in Edinburgh.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5051</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Unite for Workers of Falkirk Sign Factory</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament approves of the inter-party support of Falkirk Council in opposing the UK Government&rsquo;s implementation of the Work Choice programme; considers that the Work Choice programme would revoke funding for important businesses such as Falkirk&rsquo;s Sign Factory, which employs sustainable jobs for disabled people; notes that, if the Work Choice programme is implemented, over 40 disabled employees could be affected, and agrees with Falkirk Council in opposing such reprehensible governmental actions that stifle, instead of promoting, employment for the most vulnerable members of society.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4986#</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Conduct of Inquiries into Fatalities at Level Crossings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the continuing loss of life at railway level crossings, most recently at Halkirk in Caithness and, in January 2009, at Gatehead in Kilmarnock and Loudoun; notes the large number of organisations involved in the investigation of rail accidents and incidents in Scotland, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, the British Transport Police, Scotland&rsquo;s eight police forces and the Office of Rail Regulation, and considers that, following the Review of Fatal Accident Inquiry Legislation being conducted by Lord Cullen, a modernised system of fatal accident inquiries can contribute to greater coordination and scrutiny of any inquiries, including the implementation of any recommendations, by whichever agency, following such tragic incidents.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4882#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Don&rsquo;t Derail GARL</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the proposal in the SNP government&rsquo;s draft budget, published on 17 September 2009, to drop the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) project; considers that the proposed cut is short-sighted, given that a new airport rail link would provide Glasgow with a direct connection to three international airports and would contribute in a positive fashion to the economic development of Glasgow and west central Scotland, especially at this difficult time; believes that the rail link is an indispensable component of a modern 21st century transport infrastructure for the whole of Scotland; considers that GARL will boost public transport and reduce the number of car journeys to the airport; further considers that the promise to have GARL in place was a vital consideration in the awarding of the 2014 Commonwealth Games to Glasgow, and hopes that, in the course of the budget process, wiser counsel prevails.</p>
