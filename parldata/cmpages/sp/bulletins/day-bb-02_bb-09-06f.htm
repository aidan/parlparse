          <p><strong>*S1M-3361</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Gulf 
            War Veterans</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the deep concern 
            over the health conditions of Scottish Gulf War veterans and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to recognise their illness and to ensure 
            that they receive the appropriate treatment.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3360</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Doors Open 
            Day 2002</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the Doors Open Days 
            2002 initiative taking place in September 2002, co-ordinated by the 
            Scottish Civic Trust, which gives people the opportunity to visit 
            and explore for a day, free of charge, various buildings across Scotland 
            such as castles, stately homes and law courts, many of which are not 
            normally open to the public, and believes the initiative gives people 
            the opportunity to improve their understanding of their local architectural 
            environment and the country's rich built heritage.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3359</strong> <strong>Mr John McAllion: Safe Child 
            Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the Safe Child Scheme 
            launched in Milton of Craigie Retail Park, Dundee; notes that the 
            use of contact cards allows a lost child to be reunited with his or 
            her parents quickly, and further notes that this is part of a wider 
            scheme aimed at providing a safe environment for the community in 
            the east end of Dundee.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3358 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3357#</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Importance of 
            Primary Care</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance 
            of primary care in managing 90% of patient contact with the NHS in 
            Scotland; appreciates the vital role GPs play in providing primary 
            care services as part of the wider primary care team; supports the 
            statement that &quot;if it can be done in primary care, it should 
            be done in primary care&quot;, and acknowledges the urgent need for 
            reform and support to invigorate staffing levels, facilities, IT provision 
            and morale for this to become a reality.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3356</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Drug Testing 
            Regime of the International Olympic Committee</strong>-That the Parliament 
            urges the International Olympic Committee to adopt a more rigorous 
            regime that will conclusively and unambiguously identify methamphetamine 
            in tests for banned substances carried out on athletes to ensure that 
            no athlete is automatically banned from competing with the subsequent 
            loss of reputation, earnings and, in the case of Alain Baxter, an 
            Olympic medal which was won fairly and without the use of a performance-enhancing 
            drug, as objective scientific opinion now verifies.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3352*#*</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Support for Crofting 
            in the Highlands and Islands</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            the importance of crofting to the Highlands and Islands; welcomes 
            the publication of the White Paper on crofting reform and encourages 
            crofters to participate in the consultation now underway; further 
            notes the level of agricultural returns to crofting businesses and 
            supports the agri-environmental focus that the Environmentally Sensitive 
            Area scheme has brought to many crofting counties, and encourages 
            continuing support to crofting through such measures as the Crofting 
            Counties Agricultural Grants scheme. </a></p>
