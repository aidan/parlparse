    <strong><font face="Arial">S1M-905 Bill Aitken: Announcements made by the Scottish
    Executive&#151;</font></strong><font face="Arial">That the Parliament agrees that considerable confusion has been caused
    by a number of recent Scottish Executive announcements, particularly funding
    announcements; believes that the way funding announcements are made by the Scottish
    Executive has done little to further open government; notes that the Executive has allowed
    the same resources to be announced as &quot;new funding&quot; on more than one occasion,
    thus damaging public scrutiny, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to institute a new
    protocol for all public and press announcements in order that these make clear whether
    funding announced is additional resources or whether it is part of a previous funding
    package and, if it is, when and through what statement the funding was previously
    announced. </font></p><p ALIGN="left">

    Aitken, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that the provision
    of information by the Scottish Executive about its policies, spending plans and public
    services is an essential part of open, participative Government; agrees that such
    provision of information needs to be carried out in a modern, professional, pro-active and
    impartial manner so as to engage all interested citizens, and notes that the Scottish
    Executive will continue to pursue these aims&quot;. </font></p><p ALIGN="left">

    Aitken, leave out from &quot;a new protocol&quot; to end and insert &quot;and implement
    with immediate effect a policy for all Parliamentary, press and public announcements which
    is based upon the founding principles of this Parliament as defined by the Consultative
    Steering Group, that is to be accountable, accessible and open, and in particular to make
    absolutely clear in all such announcements whether policy innovations are new or repeated,
    whether funding announcements are allocations or distributions and from what budget in
    what year these sums will come.&quot; </font></p><p ALIGN="left"><i>

    <strong><font face="Arial">S1M-1008 Phil Gallie: Crime and Punishment&#151;</font></strong><font face="Arial">That
    the Parliament notes that public confidence in the criminal justice system is at an all
    time low due to the Scottish Executive&#146;s failure to take effective steps to curb
    rising crime; recognises the frustration and anxiety felt by the victims of crime and the
    wider Scottish public arising from early prisoner release and asks the Scottish Executive
    to restore honesty in sentencing by ending automatic remission; further notes with concern
    the proposals to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 8 to 12 and to bring 16 and
    17 year old offenders within the Children&#146;s Hearings System; calls upon the Executive
    to reject the proposals and demands that the Executive brings forward its proposals to
    strengthen the law in relation to the seizure and confiscation of assets suspected of
    being derived from drug dealing.<i> </i></font></p><i>

    &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;continues to support the Executive&#146;s
    policies on law and order and commends the priorities identified in the Programme for
    Government being taken forward by the Executive, including combating drug misuse as set
    out in the Drugs Action Plan Protecting our Future and through the creation of the
    Scottish Drugs Enforcement Agency which will fund an additional 100 officers in local
    forces, tackling youth crime, particularly persistent offenders, as set out in the Report
    It&#146;s a Criminal Waste: Stop Youth Crime Now and the Executive&#146;s response,
    helping witnesses by extending a volunteer Witness Service to all Sheriff Courts, and the
    injection of an additional £8.9 million for the police which is sufficient for forces to
    recruit a further 300 extra officers&quot;. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial">S1M-1008.2 Roseanna Cunningham: Crime and
    Punishment&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-1008) in the name of Phil Gallie, leave out
    from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that issues of crime and
    punishment are complex; contends that to ensure public confidence a criminal justice
    system requires to be effective, which in turn depends on adequate resourcing at every
    level; further recognises that there is some identifiable concern amongst the public about
    both current sentencing patterns and the effectiveness of detention; welcomes the fact
    that Scotland has human rights responsibilities as a result of the incorporation of the
    European Convention on Human Rights; and calls upon the Scottish Executive to consider the
    establishment of an accurate review of public attitudes to sentencing and detention which
    would inform both the judiciary and the Scottish Prison Service and further to address
    urgently the current under-resourcing of all parts of the criminal justice system in
    Scotland.&quot; </font></p>
