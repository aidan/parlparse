<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3166</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>The Future of the Arts in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the letter circulated on 5 January 2008, with 440 signatories, expressing apprehension about the formation of Creative Scotland and the effects on artists&rsquo; welfare and practice, including the view that the situation regarding Creative Scotland has now reached crisis point; notes that the letter highlights a perceived lack of concern for artists&rsquo; needs and UNESCO declarations on culture and freedom, a lack of meaningful consultation with the arts communities during the transition process, an inadequacy of funding and an impact on artistic independence of proposals that include an exploitation of intellectual property rights and an introduction of loans coupled with a cut in grant aid; recognises that this is the latest in a series of criticisms of the Creative Scotland proposals and believes that this lack of confidence in&nbsp;the formation of Creative Scotland is shared by many others; considers that the proposals for Creative Scotland have failed to convince many people that they offer any significant improvement on the current provision of support for artists and the development of, and entitlement to, culture in Scotland and moreover that many consider that they will have a negative impact on our arts and culture, and believes that the Scottish Government should take on board these criticisms and not proceed further without reviewing its plans, consulting widely and seeking consensus on a positive and constructive way forward for the funding and development of arts and culture in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3165</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Situation in Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is gravely concerned at the tragic events that began in the Gaza Strip on 27 December 2008 and the subsequent ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli troops; believes that this response is disproportionate and is extremely concerned at the huge loss of life and the many thousands injured in the air attacks; condemns all acts of violence and aggression against civilians; believes that there should be an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli troops as a first step in a process towards peace to bring about a lasting settlement for Palestinians and a secure Israel, and further believes that in the event of a ceasefire all crossings should be open to ensure the availability of humanitarian aid.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3164</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>National Qualifications</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of developing the next generation of national qualifications in Scotland in line with the aims, vision and values of the Curriculum for Excellence, with its emphasis on equipping all young people to respond to the demands of the 21st century through developing their capacities as successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors and acknowledges the challenges and opportunities in taking forward the findings of the national consultation exercise and the key role to be played by local authorities, schools, colleges, universities and others in ensuring that we develop a system that meets the expectations of society, in which robust and credible assessment supports good learning and teaching and all young people have the opportunity to acquire the skills, knowledge and experience that they require to take their places in a modern society and economy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3162</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Health Boards (Members and Elections) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Health Boards (Members and Elections) (Scotland) Bill.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3160</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Action Needed to Secure Ceasefire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the international community to act with the utmost urgency in efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas before the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza leads to the death of thousands of innocent civilians; believes that the disproportionate nature of the Israeli offensive and its collective punishment of the civilian population via the blockade are illegal under international law, warranting investigation by the International Court of Justice, and notes that, despite Israel&rsquo;s attempts to justify these acts, a growing number of people are highly critical of the Israeli actions and supportive of the Palestinian situation, as evidenced by the current demonstrations and supportive events throughout the world, such as the recent fundraising dinner held by Islamic Relief Scotland, which raised &pound;160,000 for the people of Gaza to buy medical equipment, including incubators and medical kits.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3159</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Helen Suzman</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament pays tribute to the life of Helen Suzman and her long fight against apartheid and for liberal values in South Africa during her parliamentary career from 1953 to 1989 and beyond, particularly as the only parliamentarian in the South African Parliament publicly and actively opposed to apartheid from 1961 to 1971 as representative of the Progressive Party and later as a leading member of the Progressive Reform Party and the Progressive Federal Party; remembers Helen Suzman&rsquo;s work for the South African Institute of Race Relations, her opposition to the 90-day detention law in 1963 and to the arbitrary powers of the South African justice minister and her long support for Nelson Mandela despite threats against her from the Nationalist government; remembers also her work as a member of the Independent Electoral Commission that oversaw the first democratic election in 1994 and as a member of the South African Human Rights Commission; recalls that she was declared an enemy of the state by President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe in 2001; notes that she was twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and won the United Nations Human Rights award in 1978; mourns the death of this undaunted champion of freedom, but believes that her work will live on in the new South Africa and in the Helen Suzman Foundation, which bears her name and which continues to support liberal democratic ideas in that country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3158</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Last Train on the Waverley Line</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 40 years ago, on 5 January 1969, the 21.55 from Waverley station to St Pancras was the final journey of the last train on the Waverley line; also notes that its closure was not without a fight, with protesters blocking the line at Newcastleton causing the Night Midland sleeper to be several hours late; regrets that its closure left the Scottish Borders as the only region in mainland Britain without passenger railway stations; notes further that, in June 2000, the Scottish Parliament voted unanimously to restore the line and that the Scottish Government has already provided &pound;1 million to allow preparatory work to begin for construction, and, on this anniversary, reasserts its commitment to reinstatement of the line.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong>, Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3157</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Cut Power Bills Now</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the forward price of gas for delivery in winter 2009 has plummeted from 109p per therm in July to 63.6p per therm in the last days of 2008, a decline of almost 42%; further notes that the forward price of electricity fell from &pound;94.50 per MWhour to &pound;56.65 over the same period, a decrease of over 40%; is concerned that power companies that were so keen to raise prices rapidly and in full during 2008 are much more reluctant to pass on full price cuts quickly, with consumers expected to wait until February or March for probable price cuts of only 5% or 10%, with 20% cuts at best; acknowledges that the wholesale cost of gas and electricity represents about two thirds of the total cost of supply borne by energy providers, and believes therefore that hard-pressed energy consumers, both domestic and business, should receive full price cuts and swiftly or that energy providers should be compelled by the UK Government to make the cuts.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3156</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Woodland Trust Scotland&rsquo;s Christmas Card Recycling Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Woodland Trust Scotland&rsquo;s Christmas card recycling scheme being operated in conjunction with Waste Aware Scotland from 2 to 31 January 2009; encourages people to recycle their Christmas cards by taking them to special recycling bins placed in participating WH Smith, Tesco and TK Maxx stores; encourages people who do not traditionally recycle their cards to participate in the scheme and help to make recycling part of their daily lives, and notes that funds raised from the scheme will help to plant new trees in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3155</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>HMS Scotia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Commander Nick Dorman and the officers and ratings of HMS Scotia, Rosyth, on winning the Richards Trophy, the first time that the trophy has been won by a Scottish unit, and notes that there are 14 Royal Naval Reserve units in the United Kingdom, HMS Scotia being one of the largest with a catchment area covering most of the east coast of Scotland drawing recruits from all backgrounds, including seven universities and many colleges.</p>
