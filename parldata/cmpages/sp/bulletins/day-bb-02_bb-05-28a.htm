          <p>9.30 am&#9;Time for Reflection - Reverend Easter Smart, Chaplain 
            to the University of Aberdeen </p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Executive Debate on The Modernising Government 
            Fund-<strong> </strong> </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3150</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The 
            Modernising Government Fund</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            Scottish Executive's commitment to modern, high quality, efficient 
            and responsive public services and supports its approach, through 
            the Modernising Government Fund, to help deliver the changes which 
            will integrate government, exploit the benefits of information and 
            communications technology and put citizens at the centre of public 
            service delivery in a 21st Century Scotland. </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <blockquote>
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-3150.1</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: The Modernising 
                Government Fund</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3150) 
                in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;, but recognises 
                that the delivery of first class public services also requires 
                support to the staff working in that sector, adequate funding 
                from central government and a commitment to ensure that the services 
                remain in the public sector.&quot; </p>

          <p>11.30 am&#9;HM the Queen's Address </p>
          <p> 2.30 pm&#9;Executive Debate on Alternatives to Custody- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3149</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Alternatives 
            to Custody</strong>-That the Parliament commends the Scottish Executive's 
            commitment to developing a range of high quality alternatives to custody 
            which fit the changing pattern of offending behaviour across Scotland, 
            and recognises the importance of ensuring the delivery of consistently 
            effective community disposals which have the confidence of the judiciary 
            and the public and also have the potential to reduce re-offending 
            without compromising public safety. </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-3149.2</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Alternatives 
                to Custody</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3149) in the 
                name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to 
                end and insert &quot;regrets the failure of the Scottish Executive 
                adequately to develop a range of high quality alternatives to 
                custody which fit the changing pattern of offending behaviour 
                across Scotland; recognises the importance of programmes which 
                are well-resourced and available across every jurisdiction in 
                Scotland, and believes that a greater element of restorative justice 
                should be introduced into the Scottish criminal justice system 
                whether dealing with adults or young offenders.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S1M-3149.1</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
                Alternatives to Custody</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3149) 
                in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; 
                to end and insert &quot;warns against the widespread extension 
                of soft non-custodial sentences simply to empty Scotland's overcrowded 
                prisons without sufficient regard to the protection of the public; 
                notes with concern the plans paraded by the Scottish Executive 
                to send the parents of young offenders to jail, and calls upon 
                the Executive to put in place sufficient resources to make Scotland 
                a safer place in which to live and work.&quot; </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3146</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of

          <p><strong>S1M-3051</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Drug 
            Misuse in North East Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern that drug misuse in the north east of Scotland has increased 
            dramatically in recent years, with an estimated 50% rise in problem 
            drug users in Grampian alone between 1997 and 2000; further notes 
            that Dundee has the second highest and Aberdeen the third highest 
            level of drug misuse in Scotland and that Grampian has the highest 
            percentage of injecting drug users in Scotland, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should recognise the scale of the problem and 
            investigate the level and nature of resources that have been applied 
            to addressing this growing social problem in the north east region, 
            paying particular attention to (a) the role and accountability of 
            the various agencies involved, (b) the amount of resources dedicated 
            to drug users, (c) the cost to society in terms of loss of life, associated 
            health problems and distress caused to users' families and (d) the 
            enormous amount of drug-related crime inflicted on the local community, 
            reflected by the fact that 80% of inmates at HM Prison Aberdeen test 
            positive for drug use at reception. </p>
