<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4359</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Birds Eye Skew - Misleading and Cynical Advertising Campaign by Unilever plc</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its continued support for the Scottish salmon industry which employs around 10,000 people, many in areas where there are no alternative sources of work, and generates around &pound;700 million annually for the economy; notes that Unilever plc, which owns the &quot;Birds Eye&quot; brand of processed food, is paying for a television advert which contains an unwarranted and unjustified attack on the Scottish salmon industry by falsely suggesting that Scottish farmed salmon is inferior; notes that the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation has described this advert as &quot;melodramatic and cynical&quot; and endorses this criticism, and believes that Patrick Cescau, Chief Executive of Unilever plc, who is ultimately responsible for the continuing running of this advert, should intervene and cancel it now or explain why he is authorising negative coverage for an industry and product of Scottish farmed salmon, which is affordable as well as nutritious and which has been awarded the prestigious &quot;Label Rouge&quot; award in France.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4358</strong> <strong>Euan Robson:</strong> <strong>International Nurses&rsquo; Day 2006: Safe Staffing Saves Lives</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 12 May 2006 is International Nurses&rsquo; Day; further notes that the International Council of Nurses (ICN), which represents national nurses&rsquo; associations from 128 countries, has chosen the theme of safe staffing levels for this year&rsquo;s activities; supports the ICN&rsquo;s Safe Staffing Saves Lives campaign in highlighting the fact that appropriate levels of registered nursing staff lead to better patient outcomes, improvements in the patient experience and better patient safety, and believes that this complements the work of RCN Scotland and others in the nursing profession on the need for appropriate nurse staffing levels in hospitals and communities across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4357</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Local Newspaper Week, 8 to 14 May 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 8 to 14 May 2006 is Local Newspaper Week; believes that local newspapers such as the best-selling <em>Falkirk Herald</em>, the <em>Grangemouth Advertiser</em> and the <em>Bo&rsquo;ness Journal</em> are focal points for their communities, providing a forum for debate on local issues and information and feedback about local events; notes that local newspapers, through their editorial content and advertising, play an important role in the local economy; believes that local newspapers are an essential component of local democracy, facilitating the dialogue between elected representatives and their constituents, and applauds the hard work of newspaper staff whose dedication underpins the success of the local newspaper industry.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4356</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>World Lupus Day 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that World Lupus Day will take place on 10 May 2006; recognises that around 50,000 people in the United Kingdom and over five million people worldwide, of whom around 90% are female, have lupus and that it is, therefore, likely that every MSP has a number of constituents who may be affected by this condition; further recognises that while lupus can be mild it can also be disabling and sometimes fatal, has no known cure and causes many different symptoms including joint and muscle pain, fatigue, depression and kidney, heart, lung and brain involvement as well as miscarriages; acknowledges that there is an urgent need to increase awareness in Scotland, the United Kingdom and worldwide of the debilitating impact of lupus and the difficulty that can arise in gaining a diagnosis given that it mimics a number of other diseases; supports Lupus UK and other lupus organisations across the world in calling for increases in funding for medical research on lupus, targeted education programmes for health professionals and public and worldwide recognition of lupus as a significant health issue, and welcomes the progress made by the Cross-Party Group on Lupus in the Parliament in developing partnerships between MSPs, patients, health professionals and support groups.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4355</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>James Watt College, Greenock and North Ayrshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament continues to be concerned by the actions of the Principal and board of management of James Watt College in their issuing of compulsory redundancy notices to 70 full-time staff and in the lack of prior consultation with staff and union representatives; deplores attempts by the Principal and board of management to ditch collective agreements and to impose on staff new contracts which would offer poorer terms and conditions than currently exist; considers that the actions of the Principal and board of management are unacceptable and are driven by the desire to post a profit rather than by the interests of students, staff and the college itself; calls on the college to withdraw redundancy notices and allow staff to return to work and students to their studies in a secure and ordered environment and, at the same time, enter into meaningful negotiations with staff union representatives; further considers that the prime motivation for any college should be the academic achievements of students, and regrets that, in their current course of action, the Principal and board of management of James Watt College have failed the college and have, in fact, put at risk the academic achievement and future career prospects of students.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4354</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Official Opening of British Heart Foundation Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the official opening by Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre at the University of Glasgow on 25 April 2006; congratulates the BHF and the university for co-ordinating a fundraising effort that generated &pound;12 million in donations from more than 1,200 donors, including a core gift of &pound;5 million from the BHF; notes that the establishment of the centre will bring together numerous diverse areas of cardiovascular research in one world-leading facility in Glasgow; remains aware that, in spite of the significant progress that has been made in reducing premature mortality from heart and circulatory disease in Scotland in the last decade, the west of Scotland still has a disproportionately high level of premature death associated with these conditions, especially in its most deprived communities; is encouraged that the presence of the centre in Glasgow will position the city as a crucial and integral part of finding solutions to tackle coronary heart disease as a cause of premature death in the west of Scotland and throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world, and wishes Centre Director, Professor Anna Dominiczak, and her team every success for the future.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4348</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Football Sponsorship</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that commercial sponsorship of sporting events has a natural lifespan which means that it will evolve, change and end; notes that the Bank of Scotland&rsquo;s sponsorship of the Scottish Premier League is to end after the 2006-07 season after nine successful years with an investment of &pound;17 million; welcomes the Bank of Scotland&rsquo;s continued support through major new investment of &pound;1.5 million in grassroots football over the next three years; notes that 140,000 young people are expected to benefit, and wishes the Bank of Scotland and boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; football clubs every success in this new initiative.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4347</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen University Staff Threatened with Pay Stoppage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled at the threat made by Professor Stephen Logan, Senior Vice Principal of the University of Aberdeen, to stop entirely the pay and pension contributions of all staff taking part in the present industrial action short of a strike; considers that this threat, conveyed by Professor Logan in an email to all staff, would constitute an unlawful deduction of wages if carried out; supports the AUT, NATFHE and EIS members in their campaign for better wages and conditions; considers that the union members were forced to take industrial action by the failure of the employers to respond to their pay claim; commends the university staff for the goodwill displayed with regard to carrying out unpaid overtime to ensure that students&rsquo; assessments are marked on time and regards the draconian response to the industrial action as seriously undermining this goodwill; believes that if this pay stoppage goes ahead the unions would be fully justified in stepping up their action to all-out strike, and demands that the Court of the University of Aberdeen refuses to authorise the pay stoppage and forces the employers to engage in constructive and unconditional pay talks.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4345</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Justice for Mesothelioma Sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave concern at the House of Lords ruling on 3 May 2006 which means that compensation for mesothelioma sufferers will be cut and supports Lord Rodger&rsquo;s judgement that, no matter where an individual contracted the disease, they should receive a full payment, reflecting practice in the Scottish courts.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4341</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Cuts to Compensation for Mesothelioma Sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that sufferers of mesothelioma and their families face massive cuts in their compensation following a ruling by the House of Lords which, at the same time as depriving vulnerable and low income families of much needed monies, will reward insurance companies with billions of pounds; believes that this decision means that workers injured by their employers will continue to be denied justice, and further believes that, if the law has been applied accurately, then the law is inadequate and that legislation should be urgently introduced to ensure full settlement for sufferers and families and that natural justice prevails.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4340</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>James Watt College, Greenock</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is both shocked and appalled that the Principal and the Board of James Watt College in Greenock have breached the terms of collective agreements with the teaching trade union, the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), have issued 90-day redundancy notices to the entire academic staff and have announced the intention to make one-in-five of all academic staff redundant, whereby only those who sign new contracts with much worse terms and conditions will be re-employed; congratulates EIS members at the college who have voted by 94% in favour of industrial action; calls for solidarity in support of their strike action; believes that the college board has taken this unilateral action not to deal with a financial deficit but to make a profit of &pound;2 million next year; further believes that this is irresponsible management of public money, and calls for the immediate withdrawal of the redundancy notices and the resumption of negotiations with the EIS representatives.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4171#</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Ensuring the Independence of Scottish National Statistics</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in light of the proposals from HM Treasury for the establishment of an independent UK Office for National Statistics, notes that no proposals were made for Scotland; further notes that such proposals for Scotland are the responsibility of the Scottish Executive, and considers that, in light of previous statistical issues such as the loss of Objective 1 funding for the Highlands and Islands through statistical error, the Executive should take similar measures to place the production of Scottish statistics on a statutory basis, incorporating the National Statistics Code of Practice, and establish an independent Office of Scottish Statistics with independent governance answerable directly to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4052#</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>New Powers for Credit Unions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the extended facilities available to credit unions from April 2006 which will allow them to offer a wider range of services to their members; notes that these facilities will include insurance products, budgeting and savings accounts and flexible low-cost loans based on ability to pay; recognises the importance of the role played by credit unions in helping to alleviate poverty, prevent debt and its devastating consequences for many low income families, encourage saving and prudent borrowing and support regeneration in many communities across Scotland, such as Glenrothes and Levenmouth in Fife; further welcomes the additional support provided for approved credit unions to establish and administer these services; acknowledges that the credit union movement embodies and promotes the principles of mutualism and co-operation, and believes that the expansion of the credit union network in Scotland will play a vital part in enabling regeneration of many more communities.</p>
