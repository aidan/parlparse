<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00456 Willie Coffey: New Public Art to Commemorate Nobel Prize Winner and Working People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes news that artists are to be commissioned to create new public art for Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley; notes that one piece will be displayed in the town of Darvel to commemorate Sir Alexander Fleming, who was born at Lochfield near Darvel in 1881 and won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1945 for the discovery of penicillin; further notes that Dean Castle Country Park will be the location for a piece of art to commemorate International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day, which takes place annually on 28 April, and considers that, while these new public artworks will greatly enhance the local community, the decision to have them produced through collaboration between professional artists and local schoolchildren means that creativity, inspiration, friendship, learning, sharing and citizenship will be the real, lasting outcomes of the projects.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00455 Willie Coffey: New Life for Annanhill House Garden</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes news that the walled garden of Annanhill House, Kilmarnock, which has been closed for two years, is to be brought back into use as allotments; considers that Annanhill is a magnificent A listed Georgian mansion, built for the Dunlop family in the 18th century and converted to form six dwellings in 1989; further understands that the walled garden started life as beautiful formal gardens for the main house and, in time, became a public garden enjoyed by generations of Kilmarnock families; recognises the dedication of Shona Sneddon and members of the Annanhill Allotment Committee in spearheading this initiative, and looks forward to the garden, in its new role as community allotments, resuming its special place in the life of the town.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00453&#9830; John Park: Supporting Supporters Direct</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes what it considers to be the outstanding assistance that Supporters Direct has given over recent years to football fans&rsquo; trusts north and south of the border that have sought to take a more active role in the running of their clubs; recognises, in particular, its help for fans in Mid Scotland and Fife and across Scotland, including the Pars Supporters Trust and the Raith Supporters Trust; welcomes the fans&rsquo; takeovers of clubs including Stirling Albion, Clyde FC, Clydebank and Dundee; deeply regrets the English Premier League&rsquo;s decision to cut funding for Supporters Direct&rsquo;s work in England; recognises the key role that the Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Football Association have with regard to the future success of Supporters Direct, and believes that cooperation will be required to ensure a continuation of the organisation&rsquo;s valuable work in Scotland for years to come.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alison Johnstone*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00452 John Finnie: Inverness to Amsterdam Air Link</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the reintroduction of a scheduled air service between Inverness and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport; believes regular direct links between Inverness and continental European hubs to be important to the economic and cultural development of the Highlands and Islands, and hopes that this is joined by more international routes from Inverness Airport.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00451 Neil Findlay: Concern at City of Edinburgh Council Privatisation Plans</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the actions of UNISON Edinburgh City Branch in organising a meeting at St Augustine&rsquo;s Church in order to raise awareness of the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s proposals to privatise what it sees as huge swathes of council services; is concerned that the City of Edinburgh Council has failed to conduct a community consultation on the privatisation plans and to provide public information on the supposed financial benefits; is further concerned that the public has no access to information on the service plans and changes and that the council has not assessed the social, economic or environmental impacts and issues in relation to its plans; considers the proposals extremely worrying for the 4,000 workers potentially affected and the service users who are fearful that service levels will deteriorate as a result of these plans and that democratic control of vital council services will be lost, and asks the City of Edinburgh Council to make publicly available all information in relation to these plans and genuinely and substantively engage and consult with UNISON, other trade unions and the communities and groups involved and affected by these plans before making any decision.</p>
<p>Supported by: Malcolm Chisholm*, Anne McTaggart*, Richard Simpson*, John Park*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00450 Joe FitzPatrick: Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland, Cut Them Free, Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland </strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Anne-Marie Carrie, Barnardo&rsquo;s UK chief executive, has described child sexual exploitation (CSE) as the United Kingdom&rsquo;s biggest hidden child protection problem; notes that services working with sexually exploited young people in Scotland have reported that the exploitation of children is becoming more organised and increasingly taking place via social media; understands that no current research exists on the full extent and scope of CSE across Scotland and that the current Scottish guidelines on CSE date from 2003 and do not cover recent online and social media developments; welcomes Barnardo&rsquo;s ongoing campaign to tackle CSE; praises the work of Dundee FACE and Glasgow Safer Choices services in supporting children and young people affected by CSE; acknowledges their petition to the Parliament calling for research to be commissioned by the Scottish Government to ascertain the full scale of the problem in Scotland, as well as calling for guidelines to be updated, and believes that CSE is not a problem confined to one social or ethnic group or one geographic area and that all agencies, whether statutory or voluntary, must work together to stop the sexual exploitation of children in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00448.2 Elaine Murray: Rural Connectivity</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00448 in the name of Richard Lochhead (Rural Connectivity), leave out from &quot;and notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;; welcomes the aspiration expressed in <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Digital Future: A Strategy for Scotland</em> that next generation broadband will be available to all by 2020; notes however that market forces alone will not deliver next generation broadband and mobile phone access to much of rural and suburban Scotland and that without public sector involvement the digital gap will widen, and therefore urges the Scottish Government to develop its strategy for investment in the necessary infrastructure throughout Scotland as a matter of priority.&quot;</p>
<p> <strong>*S4M-00448.1 Alex Johnstone: Rural Connectivity</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00448 in the name of Richard Lochhead (Rural Connectivity), insert at end &quot;; further welcomes the UK Government&rsquo;s commitment to implement superfast broadband across the whole of the United Kingdom, and calls on Scottish and UK ministers to work together to achieve the best possible coverage for rural Scotland&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00447.2 Johann Lamont: Scotland Bill - The Role of the Supreme Court in Scots Criminal Law</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00447 in the name of Kenny MacAskill (Scotland Bill - The Role of the Supreme Court in Scots Criminal Law), leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;further welcomes the group&rsquo;s reaffirmation of the continuing role of the UK Supreme Court in constitutional and human rights issues affecting Scotland; recognises that the interim report and the work of the expert group set up by Lord Wallace raise some important questions in relation to devolution issues; regrets the inappropriate language of the First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Justice with regard to highly respected judges of the UK Supreme Court and the threat to withdraw funding from the court, and believes that wider consultation and discussion on proposals for change are vital in order to allow proper, well-informed, thorough and detailed consideration of all the relevant issues and implications of reform.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00447.1 John Lamont: Scotland Bill - The Role of the Supreme Court in Scots Criminal Law</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4W&ndash;00447 in the name of Kenny MacAskill (Scotland Bill - The Role of the Supreme Court in Scots Criminal Law), insert at end &quot;; notes the realistic conclusion of the interim report that &quot;the Supreme Court would continue to make final and binding rulings on human rights issues including those arising in criminal cases from Scotland&quot;; calls on the Scottish Government to accept this central conclusion, and further notes and expresses its appreciation of the outstanding contributions to Scottish public life and the Scottish legal system made by Lord Hope of Craighead and the late Lord Rodger of Earlsferry&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00446 Patrick Harvie: Royal Bank of Scotland and the Fossil Fuel Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the World Development Movement, Friends of the Earth Scotland and other campaigning organisations for their work exposing the role of the Royal Bank of Scotland in financing the fossil fuel industry; notes in particular the bank&rsquo;s involvement with companies extracting tar sands in Madagascar and Canada; considers these tar sand developments to be socially destructive and environmentally reckless; understands that, since the public sector bail-out of the bank, it has provided finance of nearly &pound;3.6 billion to fossil fuel companies and has helped raise equity finance worth an additional &pound;9.3 billion; considers this to be a disgraceful record for any bank, but all the more so for a bank that is largely owned by the public; calls on the UK Government to require publicly owned financial institutions to reorient their lending and investment to support economic activity that is compatible with the public interest and with objectives set in UK and Scots law, most notably the urgent need to reduce CO2 emissions, and in particular calls on the UK Government to ensure that no further support of any kind is given by any of the publicly owned banking institutions for the extraction of tar sands.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00440 Neil Findlay: The Right to Withdraw Labour and the Current Industrial Action over Pensions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the right of workers to withdraw their labour is a human right recognised in the UN&rsquo;s International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; considers that any proposals to put a legal limit of 50% turnout in order to allow public sector workers to take industrial action is a precedent that governments should be wary of, especially considering the low turnouts in recent parliamentary and local government elections; supports the aspirations of teachers in England and Wales and civil servants in Scotland and across the United Kingdom to protect their pensions and jobs; queries the right of the UK Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, to question the morality of teachers on this issue when he is part of the government asking valued public sector workers to pay more, work longer and get less from their pensions, and considers that the proposal to change healthy public pension schemes is no more than a further tax on public sector workers.</p>
