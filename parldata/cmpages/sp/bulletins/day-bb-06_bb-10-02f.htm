<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4899</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan on behalf of the European and External Relations Committee:</strong> <strong>Report on an Inquiry into Possible Co-operation between Scotland and Ireland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the European and External Relations Committee&rsquo;s 3rd Report, 2006 (Session 2): <em>Report on an Inquiry into Possible Co-operation between Scotland and Ireland</em> (SP Paper 607).</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4898</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Retailing Recognition for Kilmarnock and Loudoun</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the shopkeepers of Kilmarnock for working hard to achieve national recognition for the excellent service they provide, resulting in Kilmarnock being voted the friendliest shopping town in the United Kingdom, and wishes success to Keystore, Stewarton, which has managed to beat off competition from hundreds of local shops from throughout the west of Scotland to reach the regional finals of Robert Wiseman Dairies&rsquo; Neighbourhood Shop of the Year 2006.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4897</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Scots Denied Breast Cancer Test</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great concern that a life-saving breast-screening programme which costs just &pound;20 per patient is being denied to patients in Scotland; notes that, despite being given approval by the Breast and Cervical Screening National Advisory Group who say that the extra test is &quot;cost-effective and clinically effective&quot;, NHS Scotland has refused to provide the test; also notes that the test, which is a mammogram taken from two angles instead of one, is available to women in England and Wales, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take immediate steps to introduce this test, which would be especially welcome as October is National Breast Cancer Awareness month, thereby ensuring that all patients are screened to ensure that any abnormality of the breast has a better chance of being detected.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, John Swinburne<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4896</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Global Call to Action Against Poverty Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty (GCAP) Scotland on 15 September 2006 as part of the worldwide GCAP alliance; notes that GCAP Scotland is made up of many of the organisations and networks behind the 2005 Make Poverty History campaign; further welcomes the global month of action to &quot;Stand Up Against Poverty&quot; from 14 September to 17 October 2006; notes that, while the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles agreed to cancel most of the debt of 40 poor countries and promised $50 billion more in aid by 2010, significantly more international action is needed to deliver trade justice, full debt relief, more and better aid and to tackle the scourge of HIV and AIDS; notes that millions of people around the world are still united in the fight against global poverty and inequality, and calls on the people of Scotland to show solidarity by taking part in the Stand Up Against Poverty world record attempt on 15 and 16 October 2006.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4895</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Flawed Statement on the Right to Buy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the fact that in the minsterial statement on the right to buy there was no mention of the right to retain after buying and that currently senior citizens feel that, in certain circumstances, their homes are being &quot;stolen&quot; from them by government to cover the cost of their residential care after being means-tested.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4879</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Flawed Legislation on Ageism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the new equality legislation, to be implemented on 1 October 2006, is flawed with regard to ageism as it allows age discrimination against those aged 75 years and over as far as pensions are concerned; also notes that in both Westminster and Holyrood a parliamentarian aged over 75 years will not receive pension benefits equal to those received by under 75-year-olds, and considers that this is blatant ageism which makes a mockery of otherwise sound legislation.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4878</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Protection for Polish Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the support given by T&amp;G Scotland to migrant workers in recognising their role in Scotland and raising concern over the abuse of their rights; notes that Home Office figures show that 32,135 migrant workers are registered in Scotland, most of whom are Poles; notes with concern that migrant Polish workers are suffering abuse of tenancy rights, with immediate eviction of workers on termination of employment, extreme long hours, infringements on pay, rights to paid holidays, statutory sick pay and notice rights and rights to salary slips, and illegal deductions from wages; further notes that these migrant workers also face a number of challenges outwith the workplace, including language, opening bank accounts, religious issues and issues surrounding accommodation; recognises the positive contribution that migrant workers make to Scotland economically and culturally; further recognises that the abuse of these workers is indicative of the failed neo-liberal economic policies pursued by New Labour in London which destroy workers&rsquo; lives and communities, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to demand control of Scotland&rsquo;s economy and employment legislation from Westminster and to put pressure on employers to recognise workers&rsquo; rights with regards to pay and conditions and on all landlords to recognise tenants&rsquo; rights, irrespective of nationality.</p>
