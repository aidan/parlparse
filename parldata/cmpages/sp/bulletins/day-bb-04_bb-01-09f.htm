          <p><strong>*S2M-768#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Farmed 
            Salmon and Human Health</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication 
            in the journal <em>Science</em> of an article exposing high levels 
            of organic contaminants in Scottish farmed salmon; recognises that 
            Scotland's reputation as a producer of high quality food is compromised 
            by such contamination, and believes that the Scottish Executive must 
            act without delay to investigate the source of toxic contaminants 
            in feed and elsewhere in order to protect public health and in the 
            interests of securing a sustainable future for the Scottish aquaculture 
            industry.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-767</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Fair 
            Trade Status for Hamilton</strong>-That the Parliament supports the 
            bid by Hamilton to gain fair trade status; commends the growing awareness 
            of people in Scotland of the issues surrounding fair trade and the 
            desire to be involved in such a positive way to tackle the injustice 
            of poverty, and recognises the ongoing importance of fair trade as 
            an effective way of empowering disadvantaged producers through receiving 
            a fairer deal.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-766#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Workers' 
            Educational Association</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the 
            Workers' Educational Association (WEA) is celebrating its centenary 
            year; admires the significant contribution that the WEA has made across 
            the UK in its history in helping to shape the lives of so many individuals, 
            many of whom have progressed to make a real difference to their community 
            and wider society; notes the confidence that has been built as a consequence 
            in socially and economically deprived communities where family and 
            social problems are acute, and, in recognition of the significant 
            achievements that have been made and continue to be made by the WEA, 
            encourages all public agencies across Scotland to help and support 
            the WEA in the coming century in every way possible.</P>
