          <p><strong>*S2M-774#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Recognition 
            of Kinship Care</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that many 
            grandparents have become the new foster care parents of children whose 
            mothers and fathers have become disconnected from mainstream society; 
            acknowledges that such care arrangements are usually more stable and 
            result in a positive impact on the young person, as a consequence 
            of grandparents' strong sense of commitment to provide care, but shares 
            concerns about the financial consequences experienced by grandparents 
            in providing this care; agrees that, if the needs of the child are 
            the same, then the cost is the same, and therefore considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should recognise this form of kinship care 
            by instructing local authorities to ensure that related carers should 
            have the same financial assistance and be subject to the same scrutiny 
            as recognised foster carers.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-773</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Parthenon 
            Marbles</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the visit to Edinburgh 
            in January 2004 of the exhibition &quot;Marbles Reunited: A Cultural 
            Imperative&quot;, organised by the British Committee for the Restitution 
            of the Parthenon Marbles, which digitally combines pieces of sculpture 
            originally from the Parthenon and now separated between Athens and 
            London to reveal what could be achieved if the various pieces of sculpture 
            were to be reunited; notes the recent constructive proposals by the 
            Greek Government for the return on loan of the Parthenon marbles to 
            a new purpose-built museum close to the Parthenon, which involve putting 
            aside the issue of ownership and instead entering into a partnership 
            to ensure that the marbles are displayed and conserved in the best 
            possible way; further notes that the Greek Government is willing to 
            enter into a rolling loan agreement so that other artefacts of great 
            significance which have never before been seen in the UK can be displayed 
            in the British Museum; welcomes indications that Her Majesty's Government 
            may be prepared to discuss these proposals, and hopes that Her Majesty's 
            Government will respond positively so as to enable the marbles to 
            be reunited in Athens in what would be a cultural gesture of world 
            significance.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-772#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Access 
            at Haymarket Railway Station</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern that Haymarket Station in Edinburgh does not have full access 
            to platforms or other facilities; further notes that the provisions 
            of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 which refers to access to 
            services will come into force in October 2004; recognises that a vast 
            number of stations across Scotland have limited, poor or no access 
            for people with disabilities; understands that Haymarket Station is 
            Scotland's busiest railway station; notes that during the weekend 
            of 17 to 19 January 2004 Waverley Station will be closed for the replacement 
            of signalling and that Haymarket Station will be used as the main 
            station for the capital; commends the joint discussions of the City 
            of Edinburgh Council, Network Rail, Scotrail and Transport Initiatives 
            Edinburgh in order to work together proactively to find a solution 
            to this problem, and believes that the Scottish Executive and the 
            Strategic Rail Authority must prioritise transport investment to ensure 
            that all rail passengers have equal access to services.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-771</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead on behalf of the 
            European and External Relations Committee:</strong> <strong>The European 
            Commission's Work Programme for 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the publication of the European Commission's work programme 
            for 2004, which is dominated by the enlargement of the European Union, 
            and agrees that it contains a number of legislative and non-legislative 
            plans of importance to Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-770</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Sewage 
            Dumping</strong>-That the Parliament accepts that the dumping of untreated 
            or semi-treated sewage on land is a revolting concept to the public 
            with potentially devastating health and environmental effects; notes 
            with strong disapproval the current practice of the dumping of semi-treated 
            waste in various sites in the south of Scotland by a subsidiary of 
            Thames Water plc, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ban this 
            practice completely by ensuring safe scientific methods of disposal 
            under both the precautionary and proximity principles.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-769</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack on behalf of the 
            Environment and Rural Development Committee:</strong> <strong>Report 
            on Inquiry into the National Waste Plan</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the recommendations contained in the Environment and Rural Development 
            Committee's 4th Report 2003 (Session 2): <em>Inquiry into the National 
            Waste Plan</em> (SP Paper 47).</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-768#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Farmed 
            Salmon and Human Health</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication 
            in the journal <em>Science</em> of an article exposing high levels 
            of organic contaminants in Scottish farmed salmon; recognises that 
            Scotland's reputation as a producer of high quality food is compromised 
            by such contamination, and believes that the Scottish Executive must 
            act without delay to investigate the source of toxic contaminants 
            in feed and elsewhere in order to protect public health and in the 
            interests of securing a sustainable future for the Scottish aquaculture 
            industry.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-767</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Fair 
            Trade Status for Hamilton</strong>-That the Parliament supports the 
            bid by Hamilton to gain fair trade status; commends the growing awareness 
            of people in Scotland of the issues surrounding fair trade and the 
            desire to be involved in such a positive way to tackle the injustice 
            of poverty, and recognises the ongoing importance of fair trade as 
            an effective way of empowering disadvantaged producers through receiving 
            a fairer deal.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-766#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Workers' 
            Educational Association</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the 
            Workers' Educational Association (WEA) is celebrating its centenary 
            year; admires the significant contribution that the WEA has made across 
            the UK in its history in helping to shape the lives of so many individuals, 
            many of whom have progressed to make a real difference to their community 
            and wider society; notes the confidence that has been built as a consequence 
            in socially and economically deprived communities where family and 
            social problems are acute, and, in recognition of the significant 
            achievements that have been made and continue to be made by the WEA, 
            encourages all public agencies across Scotland to help and support 
            the WEA in the coming century in every way possible.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-765#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Organ 
            Donation Opt-out System</strong>-That the Parliament believes that 
            it is time to introduce an organ donation opt-out system for Scotland 
            to try to address the ongoing shortage of organs donated within our 
            country, a shortage that leads to over 50 preventable deaths per year 
            and undermines the quality of life for hundreds of others as they 
            undergo medical treatment in the absence of available and healthy 
            organs for transplants, and believes that such an organ donation opt-out 
            system should be introduced with maximum safeguards to ensure maximum 
            choice and information to all in Scotland who may wish, for whatever 
            reason, to opt out of organ donation but at the same time believe 
            that it is important to encourage organ donation as a life-saving 
            and enhancing act of humanity.</P>

            Rate Relief for Community Amateur Sports Clubs</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the recent announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer 
            regarding a minimum 80% relief from business rates for registered 
            community amateur sports clubs and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should ensure that such relief is extended to registered community 
            amateur sports clubs in Scotland.</P>

            ill health effects of exposure to radiation suffered by people while 
            employed at Rosyth Dockyard in order to establish if there is any 
            link between their exposure to radiation while employed at the dockyard

            gap in achievements between deaf and hearing children identified in 
            its initial findings, and considers that the Executive should continue 
            to fund the project so that groundbreaking year-on-year evidence can

            to the new Parliament building, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
            Body (SPCB) should agree with the Church of Scotland to remove the

            become a centre of excellence for trauma training as part of a medical 
            facility within the University of the Highlands and Islands; acknowledges 
            that the Belford Hospital is already recognised nationally as one 
            of the UK's leading hospitals in trauma treatment because of its experience 
            in dealing with mountain casualties, and further recognises that this 
            proposal would go a long way to help resolve the current recruitment 
            difficulties being experienced in some specialisms of the medical 
            profession and would give young people within the Highlands and Islands

            Commission (EOC); notes with concern that the EOC helpline receives 
            more calls from women facing problems at work because of pregnancy 
            than on any other subject; further expresses alarm that women have 
            been demoted, disciplined or sacked simply for having a baby; strongly 
            believes that the Scottish economy needs the skills and experience 
            of pregnant women in the workplace and women returning from maternity 
            leave, and calls on the Scottish Executive to act upon the findings

          <p> <strong>S2M-754#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>National

            that many aspects of Scottish life would benefit from the adoption 
            of St Andrew's Day as a holiday and day of national celebration; recognises 
            the value that similar national days, such as Thanksgiving Day in 
            the United States of America, bring to other countries, and considers

            funded by the Scottish Executive, looking at transport options for 
            the A701 corridor and believes that any debate in advance of the publication

          <p><strong>S2M-629#</strong> <strong>George Lyon:</strong> <strong>Medical 
            Services in the West Highlands</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the deep concern of the communities in Fort William and Oban regarding 
            the threat to future provision of acute medical services in the west 
            Highlands; notes that over 3,500 people, so far, have turned out at 
            public meetings to express their opposition to Argyll and Clyde and 
            Highland NHS boards' plans to downgrade Oban and Fort William hospitals 
            to community status; recognises that, if the proposals go ahead, patients 
            from the West Highlands would be forced to travel hundreds of miles 
            to Glasgow or Inverness to access treatment, and therefore believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should reject these plans and give a commitment 
            that the current service provision will continue to be delivered locally 
            to communities in the West Highlands.</P>
