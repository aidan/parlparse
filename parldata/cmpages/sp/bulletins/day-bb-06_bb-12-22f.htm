<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;
  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5373</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Concern Over New Glasgow Children&rsquo;s Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament voices serious concern at the proposed reduction in beds at the new Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow which, according to Alasdair Fyfe, one of Scotland&rsquo;s most senior paediatric surgeons, is happening because &quot;the judgments of clinicians and other staff regarding the planned clinical requirements are being significantly challenged on the basis of the financial restraints in place&quot;; agrees with Mr Fyfe&rsquo;s statement that a better financial package needs to be provided in order to cope with the predicted increase in patient numbers; notes that the emotive decision to close Yorkhill Hospital gained acceptance only as a result of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to provide a replacement children&rsquo;s hospital that was equal to, if not better than, the previous hospital; questions whether the Minister for Health and Community Care&rsquo;s commitments have been reneged on, and believes that the Executive should investigate this issue with utmost urgency with a view to having a full debate after the parliamentary recess.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5372</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Agency Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the growing number of jobs in Scotland, over 130,000, that are considered temporary and are mainly filled by agency workers; believes that these jobs are among the most precarious and vulnerable in the labour market, with pay and employment rights generally inferior to those of permanent employees, frequently excluding workers from maternity and paternity leave, the right to paid notice on the termination of employment and the right to claim unfair dismissal, and further believes that such a situation is unacceptable in modern society and&nbsp;that the Scottish Executive should support the introduction of the Directive on temporary agency workers&nbsp;in Europe and the introduction of legislation at UK level to establish the principle of&nbsp;pay and conditions for agency workers being equal to those of workers who are permanently employed.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5370</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Involving Young People in Community Councils</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the section in <em>What can we do to help Community Councils fulfil their role?,</em> the analysis of responses to the Scottish Executive discussion paper, on making greater efforts to involve young people in community councils, using such means as creating a youth sub-group, specifically involving young people in the development of recreational projects and discussing youth issues, working with school youth or pupil councils and asking Westminster to lower the minimum voting age for community council elections to 16, and encourages the Executive and COSLA to work together to promote these policies.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5369</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Old Parr Superior, the Finest Whisky in the World</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates MacDonald Greenlees of Leith on its Old Parr Superior 18 Years Scotch whisky being the first blended Scotch to be judged in the prestigious <em>Jim Murray&rsquo;s Whisky Bible </em>as the best whisky in the world, ahead of 3,600 distinguished malts and deluxe blends, with 97 points out of 100 which equals the highest-ever score in the publication; recognises that the blending of whisky in Scotland is a fine art that has made Scotch whisky the pre-eminent whisky in the world by enabling the mass production of reliable and consistently high-quality blends and that the blending of single malts offers the opportunity to create an outstanding complex whisky with many characteristics; further recognises the success of Old Parr in many export markets but regrets that Old Parr is not available in Scotland, and calls on Diageo, the owners of MacDonald Greenlees, to consider making Old Parr available in Scotland, if not permanently then temporarily, to celebrate its distinction as the best whisky in the world and calls for it to be available in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s bar and shop.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5368#</strong> <strong>Paul Martin:</strong> <strong>Dennistoun Dispersal Order</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of the dispersal order in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow; notes that the dispersal order has been widely welcomed by residents who live in the Dennistoun area; recognises the importance of ensuring that the legal remedies provided by the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 are enforced; congratulates Strathclyde Police E Division on its commitment to ensuring that the dispersal order introduced on 13 October 2006 is a success, and believes that steps should be taken to ensure that a comprehensive exit plan is in place after the dispersal notice expires, that there is a local plan to ensure that local youth diversionary activities are in place and that an independent evaluation is carried out.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5367</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>My Money is as Good as Yours</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing number of establishments in England that are refusing to accept Scottish banknotes, viewing this form of discrimination as something which calls into question the benefits Scotland receives from being part of the United Kingdom; expresses continuing bemusement that Scottish banknotes are not legal tender in either Scotland or the rest of the UK, while the only legal tender are coins from the Royal Mint and some of these are subject to limitations, for example &pound;1 worth of 1p coins is legal tender but &pound;1.01 is not and &pound;1 and &pound;2 coins are legal tender in Scotland to an unlimited amount; notes that all money, whether printed in Glasgow or London, is subject to the same requirement to carrying a promise to pay the bearer the value of the note, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland to change Schedule 5, Part II, A1 of the Scotland Act 1998, which states that the issue and circulation of money is a reserved matter and therefore that the Scottish Parliament has no powers to alter the legal position of Scottish banknotes, thus ending this queer and somewhat confusing situation.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5366#</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Nominated Neighbour Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the risk to older and vulnerable householders from bogus callers; congratulates Fife Community Safety Partnership for its innovative and highly successful Nominated Neighbour Scheme; notes that, during the pilot project for this scheme in Glenrothes in Central Fife, there were no incidences of bogus callers reported to Fife Constabulary; further notes that the scheme is cheap and simple to operate; welcomes the bond that is created between neighbours by the Nominated Neighbour Scheme; believes that schemes such as this and other similar neighbour protection schemes engender a feeling of security and safety among older and vulnerable householders, which in turn leads to less stress and anxiety; pays tribute to all those who participate in community safety partnerships and panels across Central Fife and Scotland, and welcomes the funding from the Scottish Executive, local authorities and other sources which make such schemes possible.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5365</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Death Threats to Colombian Trade Unionists</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern a communiqu&eacute; issued on 14 December 2006 in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia, to Mr Euripides Yance, a Coca-Cola worker and member of the national committee of Sinaltrainal trade union, and Messrs Limberto Carranza and Campo Quintero among others; notes that this communiqu&eacute; is essentially a death threat to various student, social and trade union leaders if they do not leave the city within a week; remembers that Mr Yance visited the Parliament in 2005 as part of a UK tour organised in solidarity with Sinaltrainal members to alert parliamentarians to the dire state of human rights in his country and the persecution of militant trade unionists, student leaders and human rights defenders; further notes that this death threat occurred just days after Colombia&rsquo;s Vice-President Francisco Santos made a public declaration referring to what he described as campaigns to discredit Coca Cola, Nestl&eacute; and other private corporations and contended that they are pushed by &quot;sectors of the extreme left, radicals infiltrated into trade union sectors that are generating absolutely absurd campaigns against the corporations&quot;; further notes that these threats have occurred at the same time as the Sinaltrainal trade union is negotiating its demands in respect of the Coca-Cola bottling plants in Santander, the region in which Barranquilla is situated, and calls on the government of President Alvaro Uribe to ensure that the lives of Mr Yance and the other trade unionists are protected and an investigation into the facts of this communiqu&eacute; is carried out in order to ensure that its intellectual and material authors are brought to justice.</p>

<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5359#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Cervical Cancer and the HPV Vaccine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the licensing of the first vaccine against strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV) responsible for around 70% of cases of cervical cancer; expresses its concern that, despite a 40-year history of cervical screening in the United Kingdom, almost 3,000 women are diagnosed and 1,000 women still die of cervical cancer each year in the UK; recognises that the vaccine will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer and that it is not known whether it will prevent cancer in women already infected with HPV; therefore believes that the cervical cancer screening programme should be continued and that further action should be taken to increase the take-up of screening in more deprived areas, among ethnic minority groups and among women with learning difficulties; further believes that this will improve early detection and allow earlier treatment of this disease; recognises the role of charities such as Jo&rsquo;s Trust, Cancerbackup and Cancer Research UK, amongst others, in supporting patients with cervical cancer and their families and in counselling the thousands more women who worry about their health following an abnormal smear result; recognises the huge potential benefits to be had through vaccination in East Renfrewshire and throughout Scotland from reducing the incidence of cervical cancer, reducing the number of colposcopies, reducing the number of abnormal smears and reducing the number of people requiring treatment for genital warts; further recognises the success of the Scottish Executive in its public health campaigns and cancer prevention strategies, and considers that ministers should put in place measures to raise awareness and to prepare for a vaccination programme.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5357</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Recognition and Support for Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and applauds the work undertaken in our society by Scotland&rsquo;s 480,000 unpaid carers; notes that the work of those carers contributes around &pound;5.3 billion worth of care, more than half of the entire budget of NHS Scotland; further notes that lack of support means that an increasing number of carers are forced to give up caring every year due to the detrimental effect caring has on their own health; acknowledges that one in five carers suffer from poor health and that carers are a third more likely to become permanently sick or disabled than people with no caring responsibilities; recognises that half of carers who provide substantial care have suffered a physical injury due to their caring role or have received treatment for anxiety, depression or mental ill-health; further notes that at least 17,000 carers are young people whose schooling and social life can be affected, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement fully the NHS Carer Information Strategies across Scotland to prevent today&rsquo;s carers from becoming tomorrow&rsquo;s patients.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5356</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Tartan Kilts Made by Scottish Companies for the Royal Regiment of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Royal Regiment of Scotland should use the highest quality woollen cloth for its tartan; is concerned that there is a shortage of kilts for the army at present; notes that EU rules insist on competitive international tendering for the supply of goods worth more than &pound;300,000, which could result in the cheapest and most inferior product being chosen, and calls on the Ministry of Defence to announce when the trialling of kilts for the Royal Regiment will end and to ensure that every consideration is given to the contract to supply kilts to the Royal Regiment of Scotland being kept in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5350</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Compulsory Advertisements for Charities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the Scottish Executive is considering compelling charities to pay up to &pound;5,000 for advertisements whenever they plan significant changes to their charitable aims; believes that such advertisements represent very bad use of a charity&rsquo;s funds since very few people will read them, and further believes that making better use of the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator&rsquo;s website to publicise the changes would reach more people at less cost, that charities taking out such advertisements could be open to challenge for misuse of their funds in a way that does not provide best value for money and that donors will be deterred from giving if they consider that their money will go to pay for an administrative advertisement.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5344</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Safe Zones</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Strathclyde Police for its decision to repeat the Safe Zone initiative in Motherwell and Wishaw and elsewhere over Christmas and New Year; notes that the initiative has in the past helped cut alcohol-related violence; further notes that these zones, which are located in car parks near nightclubs and are well-lit and covered by CCTV, help to make town centres safer by ensuring that people out late for the evening do not need to wander the streets in search of a taxi; acknowledges the benefits of the initiative as part of a safety and violence-reduction strategy which will include high-visibility police patrols on the streets during the day and night; urges the Scottish Executive to continue to highlight the potential danger of consuming an excessive amount of alcohol and the sense of ensuring that travel arrangements to return home after a night out are made in advance, and encourages other police forces to create similar zones in town centres for people planning to celebrate over the festive period.</p>
