            the Scottish Executive has given permission for part of Dere Street 
            to be used by four-wheel drive vehicles<strong>,</strong> which is 
            likely to lead to irreparable damage and loss of valuable artefacts<strong>,</strong>

            Environmentally Sustainable Employment and Recycling</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the significant potential to create sustainable 
            employment that will benefit both the economy and local and global 
            environments; further recognises the potential of such employment 
            to reduce the impact of climate change and toxic pollution of air, 
            land, rivers and seas, protect and enhance biodiversity, reduce social 
            exclusion and make better use of natural resources; in particular 
            recognises the potential for new jobs in the sectors of renewable 
            energy, energy efficiency, public transport, organic food and farming, 
            nature conservation, eco-tourism, education and outdoor pursuits and 
            materials re-use and recycling, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to stimulate environmentally sustainable employment as a matter of 
            priority, including by (a) ensuring that at least 30% of electricity 
            comes from renewable energy sources by 2010 with further increases 
            to 2050, (b) achieving between a 40% and 60% increase in energy efficiency 
            across domestic and industrial sectors, including the introduction 
            of enhanced building standards regulations for insulation, heat recovery 
            and passive heating and ventilation, (c) developing a strategic plan 
            for organic agriculture that would support conversion of up to 20% 
            of land to organic production within 10 years, (d) setting targets 
            for traffic reduction to further encourage a modal shift from private 
            to public transport and to redress the present imbalance between road 
            and rail funding, (e) setting a mandatory national target for recycling 
            of 30% of household waste by 2010 and further independent targets 
            for recycling of fridges, re-use of white goods and recycling or safe 
            disposal of batteries and other hazardous household waste and (f) 
            producing, in order to achieve the mandatory national target for recycling, 
            a National Re-use and Recycling Action Plan to include (i) additional 
            support for community recycling, (ii) clarification of objectives 
            for the waste industry including a presumption against incineration 
            and waste-to-energy plants in new guidelines, (iii) a commitment to 
            set an example in all areas of sourcing, consumption, re-use and recycling, 
            (iv) new guidance to developers of composting operations including 
            on methane reduction and recovery, (v) finance for and establishment 
            of Environment and Waste Resource Advice units in all large business 
            parks and (vi) steps to ensure that community recycling operators

          </blockquote>
          <p><strong><a name="2633"></a>*S1M-2633</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: 
            Faslane and the Anti-Nuclear Campaign</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that nuclear weapons pose a very real threat to humanity 
            and accordingly should be opposed on moral, social, political and 
            economic grounds; opposes the possession of nuclear weapons; supports 
            unilateral disarmament in Scotland and across the UK in pursuit of 
            a non-nuclear world, free of the threat of destruction by nuclear 
            weapons; further supports the Scottish CND and Trident Ploughshares 
            blockade of Faslane nuclear submarine base on 11-13 February, and 
            upholds the right of demonstrators to protest peacefully in support 
            of world peace.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="2632"></a>*S1M-2632</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: 
            Introduction of Progressive Water Tax</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that water and sewerage services are essential services which 
            should be publicly owned and democratically controlled for the benefit 
            of all Scotland's citizens; further believes that water and sewerage 
            service charges to domestic customers should be paid for by using 
            an income-based personal tax which would be progressive, efficient 
            and easily understood; therefore endorses the replacement of the current 
            unfair water rate system for domestic customers with a new individual 
            income-based water tax that would be fair and redistributive, while 
            raising more revenue for Scotland's water and sewerage services, and 
            notes that this new Water Tax would be collected by the Inland Revenue 
            in Scotland on behalf of the Scottish water industry.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="2631"></a>*S1M-2631 Tommy Sheridan: Abolition of 
            Council Tax</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the council 
            tax is a fundamentally unfair and regressive tax; believes in social 
            justice and the redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor; 
            therefore agrees to abolish the council tax and replace it with the 
            Scottish Service Tax which is based on an individual's income and 
            is inherently fairer, more efficient and redistributive; notes that 
            the Scottish Service Tax would raise more revenue than the council 
            tax and that it would remove the burden of paying for local government 
            jobs and services from the shoulders of low paid workers and pensioners 
            and place it firmly on the shoulders of the well paid and the wealthy, 
            and believes that the introduction of the Scottish Service Tax should 
            be complemented by the return of the right for local authorities to 
            raise and retain their business rates and a thorough investigation 
            of land value and speculation taxes to supplement local authority 
            revenue.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="2630"></a>*S1M-2630</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock: 
            European Structural Funds</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the success of the Executive's strategic approach and decentralised 
            administration in managing European Structural Funds and underpinning 
            its commitment to key policy priorities, in particular education, 
            jobs and transport, and endorses the continuation of this approach 
            to ensure a sustainable impact from this funding.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Andy Kerr<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong><a name="2629"></a>*S1M-2629</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: 
            Burns Cottage</strong>-That the Parliament notes the difficulties 
            faced by the Joint Board of Management of Burns National Heritage 
            Park which includes Burns Cottage in Alloway in continuing to secure 
            and protect the building and its contents and in ensuring continued 
            public access; agrees that the Joint Board is responsible for a uniquely 
            important site and for artefacts of huge significance which provide 
            the most important commemoration and celebration of the poet to be 
            found anywhere in the world, and calls on all of Scotland, including 
            the Scottish Executive, to take every necessary step to assist the 
            Joint Board in its vital task and also to ensure that Robert Burns 
            and his vision and values are promoted vigorously.</p>
