                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5534</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Lothian and Borders Police</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lothian and Borders Police on seizing almost &pound;1.5 million worth of cocaine in the last nine months; commends the Serious Organised Crime Unit that was launched in September 2009 for its role in the proactive approach that Lothian and Borders Police are taking to tackling drug crime; notes that, if seizure rates are maintained, Lothian and Borders Police are on course to beat both of its previous records of &pound;1.9 million worth of cocaine and &pound;2.4 million worth of class A drugs, consisting almost entirely of cocaine and heroin, seized in a calendar year, and wishes Lothian and Borders Police every success in its continuing efforts to tackle drug crime.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5533</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>SECC Success and Community Benefit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved with the trading success of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC), which has reported a 47% increase in trading profits to &pound;627,812 for 2008-09; notes that SEC Ltd is 91% owned by Glasgow City Council and that such success can only be beneficial to both the city&rsquo;s reputation as a first-class venue for events as well as to Glasgow&rsquo;s finances; however, has concerns over the decision of SEC Ltd to charge &pound;101.97 plus VAT to journalists for the use of an electric power point at the Glasgow North East by-election, which had a substantial effect on the finances of small community news providers; considers that with the 2010 UK election imminent there should be a review of charges by SEC Ltd that may prohibit local journalists being able to report on the democratic process, and believes that a more general review of the SEC Ltd pricing policy would be welcome to ensure that the SECC is accessible and affordable for use by local small businesses, charities and community organisations.</p>

                                        <p><strong>S3M-5525</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>The Illegality of the Invasion of Iraq and the Detention of Anthony Charles Lynton Blair</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the finding of an independent Dutch commission that UN Security Council Resolution 1441 &quot;cannot reasonably be interpreted as authorising individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council&rsquo;s resolutions, without authorization from the Security Council&quot;; notes that data gathered by Opinion Research Business indicated that, in September 2007, approximately one million Iraqi citizens had died as a result of the invasion of that country; further notes that, according to media reports, Hans Blix considers that the invasion was illegal and believes that the former UK Prime Minister and former US President misled the public; acknowledges that, according to the High Court of Justiciary in <em>Lord Advocate&rsquo;s Reference No.1 of 2000,</em> &quot;a rule of customary international law is a rule of Scots law&quot; and considers that, this being the case, the appropriate Scottish law enforcement agencies have the power to investigate the conclusions of the Dutch commission and the role of the former UK Prime Minister, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair, in waging a war of aggression, and looks forward to his detention and indictment.</p>

                                        <p><strong>S3M-5483</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Construction of National Indoor Sports Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome and Sports Arena</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the commencement of the construction of the National Indoor Sports Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow; notes that these facilities, when complete in 2012, will serve as a national training centre for athletics, basketball, netball, track cycling and volleyball; offers its congratulations to the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council and all other partners involved in the organisation of the 2014 Commonwealth Games for getting underway with construction work; believes that these world-class facilities will put Glasgow on the map as a centre for sporting excellence while building a lasting legacy for the city, and looks forward to the most successful Commonwealth games ever.</p>
