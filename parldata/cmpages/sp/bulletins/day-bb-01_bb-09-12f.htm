            sympathies to those whose loved ones have been killed or injured.</p>
          <p align="left">Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace<strong>*</strong>, Mr John Swinney<strong>*</strong>,

          <p align="left"> <strong>*S1M-2207</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Improving Patient

            hospitals built thanks to the PFI programme initiated by the last 
            Conservative governments but notes with grave concern that the delivery 
            of health care in Scotland has fallen far short of the standards people 
            expect, with local hospital services under threat and patients waiting 
            longer for treatment and facing the prospect of being forced to go 
            abroad to get the treatment they need in a reasonable time; calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to extend the principle of partnership 
            with the independent sector to the delivery of health care and begin 
            discussions with the independent sector with a view to signing a &quot;concordat&quot; 
            in similar terms to that already established in England, and further 
            calls upon the Executive to initiate a debate in Scotland about how 
            to improve standards of health care to the levels of the best European 
            countries without raising taxes to unacceptable levels and whilst 
            ensuring that access to high quality care is guaranteed for all.</p>

            and offending behaviour and calls upon the Executive to carry out 
            a full review of Scotland&#146;s system of juvenile justice, such

            light of the market valuation of £3.5 million which has been placed
