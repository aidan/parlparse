            into the Investigation, Legal Proceedings and Family Liaison Arrangements 
            in the Case of the Murder of Surjit Singh Chhokar</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Executive to take 
            forward the recommendations of Sir Anthony Campbell and Dr Raj Jandoo 
            in connection with the murder of Surjit Singh Chhokar; recognises 
            the significance of these issues to Scottish society as a whole, and 
            the Scottish criminal justice system in particular, and notes the 
            progress that has already been made on race, family liaison and victims 
            issues by the Scottish Police Service and the Crown Office and Procurator 
            Fiscal Service. </p>

            to motion (S1M-2406) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, insert at end 
            &quot;; but further notes the serious concerns raised by both reports 
            about the lack of resourcing of both the Crown Office and the Procurator 
            Fiscal Service and the effect that has had on their ability to operate 
            effectively; is concerned at the apparent confusion regarding the 
            definition and existence of institutional racism emerging from the 
            different conclusions of the two reports; deplores the personal attacks 
            on named individuals contained within the Jandoo Report which seriously 
            detracted from the important issues being investigated, and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to establish a full public inquiry into 
            the handling of the case, in order to restore public confidence in 
            our prosecution services.&quot; </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2300</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Rosyth 
            - Zeebrugge Ferry Service</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            the process to secure appropriate funding, including a freight facilities 
            grant, to support a direct ferry service between Rosyth and Zeebrugge 
            is at a crucial and sensitive stage; believes that the introduction 
            of this service is even more vital because of the expected downturn 
            in the Scottish economy in terms of both trade and travel impacts, 
            and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive as a matter of 
            urgency should use all the resources and persuasive powers at its 
            disposal to see this project through to a positive conclusion. </p>
