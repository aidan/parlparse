            notes with concern the growing number of planning applications for 
            supermarket developments which, if approved, will lead to the loss 
            of green spaces, increased car use and the further erosion of local 
            shopping areas, all to the detriment of local communities; recognises 
            the threat posed by large supermarket developments to smaller retailers 
            and the disproportionate impact on elderly and less mobile consumers 
            who rely on local services and supplies, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to take action to protect local communities from this threat 
            to their sustainability.</font></P>

            service to people within the SPT area and that this service is of 
            particular benefit to the old and infirm; notes with concern that 
            SPT is considering the withdrawal of evening and Sunday Dial-a-Bus 
            Services which would affect around 7,300 passengers per year, many 
            of them being elderly or infirm people who use this service to attend 
            religious services within their places of worship in the evenings 
            and at weekends, and urges its members to support any measures that 
            will ensure that SPT keep this valuable service running.</font></P>

            these abuses and in recognising that practitioners of Falun Gong are

            the Parliament welcomes to Scotland a delegation of representatives 
            from North American Indian tribal nations and US fishermen's and environmental 
            organisations; recognises their quest to obtain justice from the Scottish-based 
            multi-national, ScottishPower; backs their campaign to oblige ScottishPower 
            to establish the highest environmental standards in its operation 
            in North America; regards the damage done by dams now owned by ScottishPower 
            on the River Klamath in California and Oregon, which have blocked 
            350 miles of historic salmon spawning grounds, as unacceptable; recognises 
            that this damage has had a serious and detrimental impact on the native 
            peoples' social, cultural and economic situations; regards ScottishPower's 
            failure to include salmon restoration strategies in its future plans 
            as a failure, and calls on ScottishPower to lead the way in taking 
            active measures to reverse the decline in salmon numbers in what was 
            once America's third greatest salmon river.</font></P>

            <B>Renewable Energy Strategy</B>-That the Parliament supports the 
            recommendations set out in the Enterprise and Culture Committee's 
            6th Report, 2004 (Session 2), <I>Renewable Energy in Scotland</I> 
            (SP Paper 194); notes that the report criticises the Scottish Executive's 
            current strategy for renewables and also highlights that the Executive's 
            current policy has resulted in the development almost exclusively 
            of onshore wind farms to the exclusion of other renewable technologies; 
            believes that Scotland has the opportunity to lead the world in bringing 
            to the market new renewable technologies such as wave, tidal and biomass, 
            but that this will only happen with a change of strategy; believes, 
            therefore, that the Executive should adopt the recommendations in 
            the report and produce a new national planning strategy for renewables, 
            working with local authorities to develop local plans and targets 
            for onshore wind farms, and considers that there must be a national 
            moratorium on all locally-opposed wind farm planning applications 
            until such guidance has been developed and taken effect.</font></P>

            <B>No Support for Smoking Ban</B>-That the Parliament notes that a 
            poll of 10,000 people conducted this year by Populus showed that 74% 
            of those surveyed did not support a ban on smoking in pubs and bars 
            and that 98% said that it was better to have a choice of smoking or 
            non-smoking facilities than a complete ban; notes that an Office for 
            National Statistics survey of July 2004 showed that 80% of those surveyed 
            did not express support for a ban on smoking in pubs and bars; further 
            notes that a BMRB poll undertaken in September 2003 showed that less 
            than 17% of people agreed that smoking should be banned in pubs, clubs 
            and restaurants and that 86% felt that the smoking situation in pubs, 
            clubs and bars had improved over recent years; acknowledges that the 
            majority of people are against a complete ban on smoking in pubs; 
            believes that a complete ban on smoking in pubs would have a detrimental 
            effect on freedom of choice in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to allow landlords to determine smoking policy in their 
            establishments and ensure that freedom of choice for consumers to 
            use an establishment that allows smoking is protected.</font></P>

            Maxwell:</B> <B>More Powers for Scotland</B>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the findings of the State of the Nation 2004 survey, carried out by 
            the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, which found that 66% of people living 
            in Scotland wanted the Parliament to have more powers; recognises 
            that only by having these powers can the Parliament and the country 
            truly begin to fulfil their enormous potential, and urges all members 
            to follow the public mood and campaign for all the normal powers of 
            a sovereign nation to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood 
            forthwith.</font></P>

            <B>Citizens Advice Week</B>-That the Parliament supports Advice Week 
            from 6 to 13 September 2004; commends the vital work that Scotland's 
            77 citizens advice bureaux do in providing free, impartial and confidential 
            advice to all; recognises that in the last year they handled over 
            400,000 issues and secured nearly £26m for clients; further recognises 
            that such good quality advice on issues such as benefits, debt, employment, 
            housing and consumer affairs is increasingly necessary in today's 
            society; acknowledges that the use of client evidence means that citizens 
            advice bureaux speak with authority and relevance on changing social 
            issues from both a local and national perspective; congratulates the 
            2,193 volunteers and 329 paid members of staff who provide this service, 
            and hopes that parliamentarians across the political spectrum can 
            work together to ensure that the service will continue to inform government 
            and meet the needs of local communities across Scotland in the years 
            to come.</font></P>
