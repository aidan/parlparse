<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2824</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Pipe Major Gordon Walker - World Champion Solo Piper</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Pipe Major Gordon Walker of Moscow, Ayrshire, for yet another successful year competing in the world&rsquo;s top solo piping competitions; notes in particular his second consecutive victory in the prestigious Glenfiddich Piping Championship, in which he beat nine of the world&rsquo;s top pipers, drawn from Canada and New Zealand as well as Scotland; further notes that Pipe Major Walker took up the pipes at the age of four and a half, became world junior solo champion at the age of 14, developed his skills during a career in the army, during which he also saw active service, and since leaving the army, in addition to his increasing success in solo competitions, has dedicated himself to passing on his skills through the College of Piping, the National Piping Centre, St. Columba&rsquo;s School and Mauchline and District Pipe Band, and records its appreciation for Pipe Major Walker&rsquo;s significant contribution to carrying forward Scotland&rsquo;s piping tradition.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2823</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>World Diabetes Day 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the United Nation&rsquo;s declaration of November 14 as World Diabetes Day; further welcomes the arrival in the Scottish Parliament of Diabetes UK Scotland&rsquo;s exhibition, which aims to raise awareness of the impact that the condition has on children and young adolescents in Scotland; recognises that Scotland has one of the highest rates in the world for Type 1 diabetes and that more than 90% of young people with diabetes in Scotland are at risk of serious health complications because they lack the information and support to manage their condition properly; congratulates Diabetes UK Scotland on the publication of the <em>Making Connections</em> toolkit, which aims to give young people an improved transition from paediatric to adult services in hospitals and gives them advice on living with diabetes as young adults, and calls on the Scottish Government to support fully children and young people with diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2822</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Perth FM</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Perth FM, a new radio station for the city of Perth and surrounding areas; notes that Perth FM will be launched with a bang on 5 November 2008, and wishes all involved in this exciting new radio station well in bringing radio to the Fair City.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2819</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following revision to the programme of business for Wednesday 5 November 2008&mdash;</p>

<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Financial Resolution: Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2818</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Torrylinn Creamery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Torrylinn Creamery on the island of Arran for winning a silver award for its Isle of Arran Dunlop cheese at the World Cheese Awards in Dublin on 29 September 2008; notes that this international recognition follows a gold award at the Royal Welsh Show in July 2008 and is its 11th award won this year; recognises the particular contribution of cheese maker Paul Murray, who has been with the company for eight years; acknowledges that the Isle of Arran Dunlop is made entirely from milk supplied by three island farms; is aware that Torrylinn Creamery is run by First Milk, which is the largest dairy farmer co-operative in the United Kingdom and employs seven people; recognises that winning awards is important to both existing and potential customers and the continued prosperity of the company, and wishes Torrylinn Creamery even further success in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2817&diams; </strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>World AIDS Day 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of World AIDS Day on 1 December 2008 and its aim of highlighting the challenges and consequences of the HIV epidemic around the world; acknowledges that there are 33 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide and that countries face a myriad challenges in halting the spread of the virus and improving the lives and experiences of people affected; recognises that HIV diagnoses in Scotland have been increasing in recent years with 2007 seeing the highest annual number on record; acknowledges that it is estimated that there are 5,500 people now living with HIV in Scotland; regrets that a recent poll found that people in Scotland had comparatively poorer rates of HIV knowledge than in other areas of the United Kingdom; considers that this lack of public understanding about the virus and how it is transmitted compounds and exacerbates the stigma and prejudice experienced by many people living with HIV in Scotland, and therefore supports this year&rsquo;s theme of Respect and Protect, which highlights the responsibility of everyone to transform attitudes to HIV and encourage actions that stop its spread.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2816</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Free Public Tours of Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body on its decision to bring the contract for guided tours in-house and, consequently reintroduce free tours of the Parliament building for the general public; believes that this not only brings public tours into line with the range of free educational tours available in the Parliament, but also with many other parliament buildings across Europe that similarly offer free guided tours; further believes that this can only enhance public awareness and understanding of the Parliament and the Parliament&rsquo;s status as a major attraction in Edinburgh, and encourages all users of the building to continue to extend a warm welcome to the many visitors who pass through each day.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2815</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Scottish Sports Hall of Fame</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision posthumously to induct former World Rally Champion Colin McRae into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame following his untimely death in a helicopter crash near his home in Lanark in 2007; congratulates the other recent inductees, former Scotland and Lions rugby international David Sole, Olympic swimmer Catherine Brown and disability sportswoman Isabel Newstead, and supports the ongoing work of the hall of fame to acknowledge Scotland&rsquo;s past sporting performers, promote excellence in sport and instil sport as a key part of the nation&rsquo;s culture.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2798</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Post Office Closures in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply disappointed at Post Office Ltd&rsquo;s decision to close 11 Post Office branches in Edinburgh as part of the UK Government&rsquo;s Post Office Network Change Programme, which is set to close 2,500 post offices across the United Kingdom; is concerned at the damage that the closures will do to communities in Edinburgh that rely on their local post offices; recognises the problems that the closures will cause for elderly residents and those with mobility problems, who could now face a daunting journey to their nearest post offices; regrets that once Post Office Ltd has decided on closing a post office branch only Postwatch, now part of Consumer Focus, can review the decision before it is announced, following which there is no appeal process, and notes the questions that this raises as to the credibility of the branch closure consultation process.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2798.1</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Post Office Closures in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2798) in the name of Mike Pringle, leave out from &quot;is deeply disappointed&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that Essex County Council has worked with the UK Government to preserve post offices in the Essex area; further notes that the Lib Dem/SNP administration of City of Edinburgh Council commissioned numerous reports on this subject, yet chose not to fund a similar scheme in the capital, and believes that such inaction seriously damages the credibility of the Edinburgh Liberal Democrat&rsquo;s campaign to save post offices.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2796.1</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2796) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;but, in so doing, notes the terms of the Justice Committee&rsquo;s Stage 1 report, in particular the concerns expressed with regard to the Financial Memorandum, and calls on the Scottish Government to provide the Parliament with a more detailed analysis of the likely cost implications, from such information as is available to or can be obtained by the Scottish Government, prior to the Bill being considered at Stage 3.&quot;</p>
