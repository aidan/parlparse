          <p><strong>S1W-28782</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, regarding its proposals for ex-gratia payments 
            to be made in relation to the Scottish Bus Group Pension Funds, whether 
            (a) it has (i) sought and (ii) obtained support from Her Majesty's 
            Government that a concession should be granted by the Inland Revenue 
            that recipients of such payments will not attract a liability for 
            income tax, (b) the widow or widower of a member of the pension scheme 
            who died on or after 18 December 2000, but before 7 June 2002, will 
            receive the same payment as the member would have received if he or 
            she had survived or whether that payment will be reduced by 50% and 
            (c) common law spouses will receive the same entitlement to payments 
            as widows and widowers.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28845</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what items of audio visual equipment have been 
            installed in the east wing basement conference complex of St. Andrew's

            the Scottish Executive what items of audio visual equipment have been 
            removed from the control room area of Conference Room 1 at Victoria

            disposal process in each case.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28847</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, with regard to comments made by the then Minister 
            for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning in respect of individual 
            learning account fraud (<em>Official Report</em>, <em>Enterprise and 
            Lifelong Learning Committee</em>, 17 April 2002, c 2546.), whether 
            the occurrence of fraud in around 3% of learning providers has now 
            been firmly established and whether the percentage of learning providers 
            identified as having been involved in such fraud has changed since 
            the comments were made.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28848</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-27337 
            by Iain Gray on 31 July 2002, whether arrangements for encouraging 
            participation in lifelong learning currently under review will involve 
            the creation of a second individual learning account scheme.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28849</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-27337 
            by Iain Gray on 31 July 2002, what its current position is on the 
            statement by the then Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong 
            Learning that the individual learning account scheme was &quot;very 
            successful and the feedback was good&quot; <em>(Official Report, Enterprise 
            and Lifelong Learning Committee</em>, 17 April 2002, c 2544.); whether 
            it aims to introduce a new individual learning account scheme quickly, 
            and what the reasons are for its position on these matters.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28850</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-27337 
            by Iain Gray on 31 July 2002, who is participating in its review of 
            arrangements for encouraging participation in lifelong learning; how 
            many meetings have taken place during the review; on what dates such 
            meetings took place, and what specific areas have been identified 
            for action.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28851</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it will place in the Scottish Parliament

            held during its review of arrangements for encouraging participation 
            in lifelong learning and what the reasons are for its position in 
            respect of any matter where disclosure of such items is declined.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28852</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive why using Capita as the individual learning 
            account (ILA) centre was &quot;significant in respect of the suspension&quot; 
            of ILAs, as stated by the then Minister for Enterprise, Transport 
            and Lifelong Learning (<em>Official Report</em>,<em> Enterprise and Lifelong 
            Learning Committee</em>, 17 April 2002, c 2544.) and, in the light 
            of its position on this matter, whether it has identified any reasons 
            why such a UK-wide approach should not be undertaken in the future.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28853</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what plans it has to lift reporting restrictions

          <p><strong>S1W-28855</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how it will ensure that any records and outcomes 
            of investigations into allegations of racism are transparent and in 
            the public domain.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28856</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it will make any records and outcomes 
            of investigations into allegations of racism since 1999 publicly available.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28857</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what steps it plans to take in respect 
            of projected levels of North Sea oil and gas exploration activity 
            following any changes to the UK continental shelf tax regime.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28858</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive whether it has made any representations

          <p><strong>S1W-28859</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether section 6(f) of the Land Reform (Scotland) 
            Bill applies to rivers navigable by canoe; whether this provision 
            is intended to permit landowners possessing fishing rights over such 
            rivers to exclude access to canoeists and, if so, how and to what 
            extent, and if this is not the purpose of the provision, whether it 
            will amend the bill in order to ensure that fishing rights should 
            not be given precedence over other recreational users, such as canoeists.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28860</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it will clarify its policy intentions 
            in respect of how the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will impact upon 
            the recreational use of navigable rivers and, if its position is that 
            the Bill should not prevent the use of such rivers by canoeists, how 
            legitimate interests of the various recreational users of rivers can 
            best be protected.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28861</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether the recent refurbishment of Halbar 
            Tower near Braidwood, South Lanarkshire was overseen in any way by

            any archaeological importance of the usage of flagstones to the tower 
            and how these were disposed of in this instance.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-28862</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it maintains a register of historically 
            important buildings currently in disuse or extensive disrepair that 
            could be re-utilised or reconstituted for domestic use, detailing 
            where any such register is held and in what format, how the public 
            can access this information and, if such a register does not exist,

            ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish the recent advice 
            given to the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning

            and, if no representative of it is to attend, what process is in place
