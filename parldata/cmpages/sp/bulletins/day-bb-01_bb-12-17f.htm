          <p><strong>*S1M-2551</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Ofgem Removal of 
            Price Controls</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern Ofgem's 
            recent proposals to lift the remaining price controls on energy use 
            in Scotland and, in particular, to lift the price caps on pre-payment 
            tariffs which will have a detrimental effect on the less well off 
            in paying fuel bills; believes that the energy market is not sufficiently 
            developed to provide protection from uncompetitive pricing practices; 
            further notes that customers with remote teleswitching meters are 
            unable to change suppliers and therefore have no access to competition; 
            is concerned that these proposals will compromise the Scottish Executive's 
            ability to deliver an end to fuel poverty through measures including 
            the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, and urges Ofgem to withdraw their 
            proposals insofar as they relate to electricity prices and pre-payment 
            meter tariffs.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2550</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Donald Whyte, Genealogist</strong>-That 
            the Parliament applauds the significant role played by Donald Whyte 
            in encouraging the development of family history and genealogy in 
            Scotland and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to 
            recognise in the new Parliament building the importance of researching 
            family history in preserving Scotland's culture and heritage.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Margaret Smith, Stewart Stevenson, Ms Sandra White, 
            Michael Russell, Richard Lochhead, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Mr Murray Tosh, 
            Fergus Ewing, Colin Campbell, Fiona McLeod<strong>*</strong>, Robin 
            Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2549#</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: Fifth Anniversary 
            of Rehab Scotland's Fife Brain Injury Vocational Service</strong>-That 
            the Parliament commends Rehab Scotland's Fife Brain Injury Vocational 
            Service, based in Kirkcaldy, on completing five years this month of 
            providing essential assistance to sufferers and increasing local awareness 
            of the effects of brain injuries; welcomes the significant role which 
            the service has played in empowering those affected by brain injuries 
            throughout Fife in rebuilding their lives and increasing their independence; 
            notes concern that many of the service's clients are young men under 
            the age of 30, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to work with 
            the voluntary sector to increase awareness of brain injuries, particularly 
            among young people.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2547</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Physical Education 
            in Primary Schools</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the HM Inspectorate 
            of Education report on improving standards of physical education in 
            primary schools in Scotland; notes that the report states that schools 
            with very good programmes often used flexible curriculum time to ensure 
            a minimum of two physical education (PE) sessions of around 40 minutes 
            weekly for pupils, provide broad and balanced programmes which include 
            games, sports, gymnastics, dance and swimming and that the programmes 
            in these schools often extend beyond the school day; compares this 
            with provision at independent schools where PE is often given more 
            time, regular input from specialist PE teachers and additional extracurricular 
            opportunities are provided, and believes that the provision of more 
            specialist PE teachers providing education in individual and team 
            sports, dance and games would increase the number of schools achieving 
            HM Inspectorate of Education's 'very good' status and lead to improvements 
            in the health and well-being of Scotland's children. </p>

            Fraser, Tommy Sheridan, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2540</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Career Opportunities 
            in the Scottish Maritime Industry</strong>-That the Parliament warmly 
            commends the crew of the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry &quot;Caledonian 
            Isles&quot;, their shorebased colleagues and members of the Glasgow 
            and West of Scotland Maritime Careers Group for their active participation 
            in recent promotional events designed to raise schoolchildren's awareness 
            of career opportunities in the Scottish maritime industry and believes 
            that such recruitment initiatives will be of considerable importance 
            to the industry and to Scottish school leavers who are keen to engage 
            in satisfying and worthwhile careers both afloat and ashore. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Marilyn Livingstone, Michael Russell, Tommy Sheridan</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2539#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil: Research into 
            Cancer Levels in the Semiconductor Industry</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the publication <em>Cancer Among Current and Previous Workers 
            at National Semiconductor (UK) Ltd, Greenock: Results of an investigation 
            by the Health and Safety Executive</em>; further notes that the study 
            gives cause for concern which can only be addressed through further 
            research across the semiconductor industry; believes that steps should 
            be taken to ensure that GPs and other health professionals are well 
            briefed and prepared for any enquiries from concerned current or former 
            members of the workforce, and further believes that Ministers and 
            officials of the Scottish Executive should work in partnership with 
            all those concerned to ensure that issues arising from this research 
            are addressed as a matter of priority. </p>

            Alex Neil</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2537</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Civil Legal Aid</strong>-That 
            the Parliament supports the Cross-Party Group on Men's Violence Against 
            Women and Children in its campaign to make it easier for abused women 
            to access civil legal aid; calls on the Executive to implement the 
            recommendations of the Justice 1 Committee that the eligibility criteria 
            for civil legal aid be widened by removing the inconsistencies in 
            the treatment of benefits and by increasing the lower capital limit; 
            urges the Executive to increase as a matter of urgency the current 
            qualifying income levels which ultimately determine whether or not 
            an application can be considered eligible to receive legal aid, and 
            further urges the Executive to review the scale of contributions payable 
            by applicants to minimise their financial burden in order to recognise 
            that many women who leave their abuser have additional demands on 
            their income which further disadvantage them.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Mr Kenneth Gibson, Mr Adam Ingram, 
            Mr Kenny MacAskill, Stewart Stevenson, Fergus Ewing, Brian Adam, Ms 
            Margo MacDonald, Michael Russell, Ms Sandra White, Shona Robison,

          <p> <strong>S1M-2536</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe: European Notes 
            and Coins</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the introduction 
            of the new notes and coins for the single European currency on 1 January 
            2002 will begin the phasing out of the existing currencies of the 
            eurozone; further notes that a recent survey found that the average 
            British household presently has £35 worth of EU coins squirreled away, 
            which suggests that up to £80 million's worth of left-over holiday 
            money, which will become worthless after the changeover, may be presently 
            lying about in Scotland, and urges all Scots to take advantage of 
            the schemes run by banks to facilitate the donation of these monies 
            to charities in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Farquhar Munro, Dennis Canavan, Mr Keith Raffan, 
            Mr Mike Rumbles</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2535</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Condemnation 
            of Female Circumcision</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">expresses 
            concern about violence against women and children especially in the 
            form of female genital mutilation (FGM); commends the research on 
            FGM being carried out by the International Centre for Reproductive 
            Health; declares FGM to be a violation of the human rights of girls 
            and women as it represents an attempt to control women's sexuality 
            and subordinate their status in society; notes the existing legislation 
            on this subject, and supports the continued promotion of women's rights 
            in an effort to stop FGM.</a></p>
