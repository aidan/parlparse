            Report 2001 by Caithness Citizens Advice Bureau</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the Social Policy Report 2001 by 
            the Caithness Citizens Advice Bureau; further notes the increased 
            number of debt cases, and the amount of debt owed to creditors, dealt 
            with by the bureau; is concerned by the number of benefit claimants 
            who are experiencing debt difficulties and the resulting increase 
            in workload placed on bureau staff representing clients at tribunals; 
            believes that extra funding and support should be made available to 
            cope with the extra demands being placed on the bureau and to allow 
            it to develop a crofting advice service, and applauds the staff at 
            the bureau&#146;s office in Wick for all their efforts and assistance 
            in the community over the past year.</p>
