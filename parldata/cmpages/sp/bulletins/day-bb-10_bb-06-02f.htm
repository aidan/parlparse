<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6473 Angela Constance: Kathleen Ross Hale, in Appreciation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and commends the dedication of Kathleen Ross Hale who has run Dedridge Grapevine for 30 years; applauds her long-standing commitment to her local community; acknowledges her considerable efforts as a fundraiser that have benefited numerous good causes, and extends its congratulations and thanks on the occasion of her 80th birthday on 26 May 2010.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6472 Michael Russell: Student Fees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the National Union of Students&rsquo; student fees pledge on the basis that any rise in fees in England and Wales would be detrimental to the interests of Scottish universities; congratulates those who have signed the pledge, and believes that student<strong>top-up</strong> fees should have no place in Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Keith Brown<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-6471 Christine Grahame: Supermarket Boycott of Israeli Produce</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports calls for peaceful direct action to be taken against the state of Israel for what is considered its ongoing flagrant disregard for international law and failure to uphold international standards of behaviour in its efforts to destabilise the entire Middle East region through its actions and policies; supports calls for a complete withdrawal of Israeli produce from Tesco, Asda, the Co-operative, Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury&rsquo;s, Somerfield and Waitrose and considers that Scots consumers can make a real difference by refusing to purchase Israeli produce from these UK-based companies, and calls on those supermarket chains to refuse to buy produce from Israel until it has demonstrated its commitment to peace and the rule of law.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6470 Jackie Baillie: Three Cheers for Arrochar, Tarbet and Luss</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the visit of His Royal Highness, The Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay, and Her Royal Highness Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay, to Arrochar and Luss on Thursday 3 June 2010; notes that His Royal Highness will be visiting the restored Arrochar Parish Church, the new Three Villages Hall, the Heritage Centre and Luss Parish Church as part of its 1,500th anniversary celebrations; understands His Royal Highness will have the opportunity to meet a number of local community groups and volunteers who have made a significant contribution to the community, as well as young people who have participated in work placements under the Prince&rsquo;s Trust, and congratulates all those involved in the day including local residents and organisations, in particular the Arrochar and Tarbet Development Trust and the Reverend Dane Sherrard of Luss and Arrochar parish churches, for their efforts in sustaining a thriving and growing community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6469 Jackie Baillie: The NHS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern emerging details of workforce projections submitted by NHS boards at the request of the Scottish Government; notes that thousands of posts are proposed to be cut across the NHS in Scotland and that these include frontline staff such as nurses, midwives and allied health professionals; further notes that job and service cuts are taking place in this financial year when the overall Scottish budget has increased by almost &pound;1 billion; believes that such a loss of frontline posts will inevitably have a detrimental impact on patient care, and therefore calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to publish the workforce projections immediately and intervene urgently to prevent cuts to frontline NHS services.</p>
