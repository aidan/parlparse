<STRONG>Margaret Smith: Tobacco Advertising</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes that the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Bill is reaching its final legislative 
stages at Westminster; congratulates the Liberal Democrat Peer Lord Clement-Jones 
for introducing the Private Member&#146;s Bill which has led to this stage; believes 
that a UK-wide ban is the most effective way forward; considers that smoking contributes 
to 13,000 deaths a year in Scotland, and welcomes the evidence that suggests that 
such a ban may save 300 lives a year and cut tobacco consumption by 2.5%.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3557</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Christine Grahame: The First Police Force</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes that established, co-ordinated and paid police forces were first established 
in Scotland from 1800 onwards, some 29 years before the Peelers in London; further 
notes that in 1800 a Bill was promoted by Glasgow Town Council seeking powers 
to establish a regular police force in the city that, once enacted, led to a parade 
of the Glasgow Police Force for duty in the Laigh Kirk Session house; notes that 
police forces followed in Edinburgh in 1805, Paisley in 1806, Greenock in 1810, 
Aberdeen 1818 and Dundee in 1824; notes that John Graham, a Glasgow merchant, 
became the first Superintendent of Police in 1862 and that, contrary to British 
history books, therefore, Sir Robert Peel in London was not the founder of modern 
policing, and urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to commemorate this 
fact and the loss of many police officers&#146; lives in the line of duty over 
these centuries in a suitable manner in the new Scottish Parliament building.</P><P>Supported 
by: Stewart Stevenson, Michael Matheson</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3555</STRONG> <STRONG>Michael 
Russell: The "Scottish Six" and the Prime Minister</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes with astonishment the remarks of the former director-general of the BBC, 
Mr John Birt, in the <em>Sunday Herald</em> on 20 October 2002 that he conspired 
with the Prime Minister in 1998 in order to stop the development of a "Scottish 
Six" main evening BBC television news bulletin, produced and edited in Scotland 
rather than in London, that he did so because he feared that it would lead to 
&quot;the collapse of the union&quot; and that according to him the Prime Minister 
&quot;was quick, as ever, to grasp the case, &#145;Let&#146;s fight,&#146; he 
said&quot;; further notes Mr Birt&#146;s words that a &quot;plan of action&quot; 
was agreed to stop the "Scottish Six", involving senior BBC personnel, Gordon 
Brown MP and Peter Mandelson MP amongst others; believes that such a conspiracy 
fatally undermines the BBC&#146;s status as an &quot;independent corporation&quot;, 
as set out in the Corporation&#146;s Royal Charter; welcomes the assurance of 
the BBC&#146;s current director-general, Mr Greg Dyke, that the issues of a "Scottish 
Six" in the forthcoming BBC review of news and current affairs output in Scotland 
&quot;will be considered on their editorial, not their political merits&quot;, 
and believes that the conclusive broadcasting arguments in favour of a "Scottish 
Six" are reflected in the fact that it is supported by the Broadcasting Council 
for Scotland, BBC Scotland management and journalists and 69% of the Scottish 
people.</P><P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Michael Matheson</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3554</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Andrew Wilson: Accounts Commission Report on Trading Standards Departments</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Accounts Commission of <em>Made 
to measure? An overview of trading standards in Scotland</em>, which assesses the 
performance of the 32 trading standards departments across Scotland; notes that 
this valuable and socially important service spends £19 million each year on providing 
regulatory and enforcement services to the business community and advice to consumers 
in Scotland; expresses its concern, however, at some of the findings of the report 
that suggest that there are "wide variations" in the levels of services delivered 
to consumers and businesses across Scotland with at least one quarter of trading 
standards departments not meeting the minimum standards of service they are required 
to meet; further notes the wide variations in the designation of premises liable 
for inspection by trading standards services which suggests "that similar types 
of premises are being under- or over-inspected, resulting in available resources 
not being used to best effect and traders not being treated consistently", and 
calls on the Scottish Executive to take action to ensure greater consistency in 
enforcement activity by trading standards services across Scotland consistent 
with best practice, as manifested in the enforcement concordat, in the interests 
of both consumers and the business community.</P><P>Supported by: Michael Matheson</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3553</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Education Standards in Cuba</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes the comments of a Wiltshire County Council spokeswoman in relation to primary 
school education in Cuba when she said &quot;Cuba has a 97% literacy rate which 
is better than ours in many areas of the country&quot;; further notes the result 
of research by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which found Cuba to be a &quot;beacon 
of education best practice&quot;, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive 
to arrange a fact-finding visit similar to that currently under way by 10 teachers 
from across Wiltshire County Council, paid for by the British Council Teachers&#146; 
International Professional Development Programme, to exchange ideas and learn 
from the positive education experience promoted in Cuba.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3542</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Robin Harper: British Energy Finances</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes the decision at the extraordinary general meeting of British Energy in East 
Kilbride on 4 November 2002 to approve the borrowing of up to £1.6 billion; further 
notes that the £650 million loan from Her Majesty&#146;s Government to the company 
has been declared unlawful by the EU Competition Commissioner Mario Monti; is 
aware that British Energy has requested that local authorities defer payment of 
business rates for its nuclear power stations; is further aware that Lancaster 
City Council has deferred the business rates of Heysham Nuclear Power Station 
at an estimated cost to the taxpayer of £18,000 and a possible cost of up to £1.7 
million if British Energy is eventually called into receivership, and calls on 
the Scottish Executive to state whether any local authority has deferred payment 
of business rates of any British Energy installations and, if so, at what actual 
and possible cost to taxpayers.</P><P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan, Ms Sandra 
White</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3540#</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Exploitation of 
Women</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing proliferation 
of lap-dancing clubs and other establishments of a similar nature throughout Scotland; 
further notes that the US-based firm Spearmint Rhino, reported to be linked with 
pornographic websites featuring the drugging, abduction and rape of women, has 
plans to expand its lap-dancing operations into Scotland; believes that these 
establishments encourage the exploitation of women and have no place in a modern 
Scotland seeking to promote equality and eradicate violence against women, and 
therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should monitor this situation 
closely and take whatever action is necessary to halt the spread of these establishments.</P><P>Supported 
by: Alex Neil, Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3539</STRONG> <STRONG>Alex Neil: 
Immediate Establishment of Public Appointments Committee</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament calls upon the Parliamentary Bureau to consider and propose the establishment 
of a Parliamentary Public Appointments Committee initially to oversee the current 
Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointment as its work relates to Scottish 
Executive appointments pending the establishment of a Scottish Commissioner for 
Public Appointments, after which the remit of the committee shall be to carry 
out interviews and recommend an individual for the post of Scottish Commissioner 
for Public Appointments once the Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) 
Bill has been passed; scrutinise the work of the Scottish Commissioner and, specifically, 
the Commissioner&#146;s annual report; take appropriate action when the Commissioner 
reports a breach in the Code of Conduct for making public appointments; ask the 
commissioner for guidance on particular appointments; and interview all major 
appointees to non-departmental public bodies on their appointment to discuss the 
policy and priorities of that body.</P><P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Tommy 
Sheridan, Ms Sandra White</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3538#</STRONG> <STRONG>John Farquhar 
Munro: Affordable Rural Housing</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the shortfall 
in affordable housing in rural areas for rent or for purchase particularly for 
young families; acknowledges that, in part, the cause of this can be traced to 
second home ownership; believes that in order to maintain a sustainable future 
for rural Scotland measures must be taken to encourage young people and families 
to remain in their communities, and considers that the Parliament should review 
the provision of socially rented housing as well as the extent of second home 
ownership throughout rural Scotland.</P><P>Supported by: Dr Sylvia Jackson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>S1M-3537</STRONG> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie: Tourism Information for People 
with Disabilities</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament urges VisitScotland to respond 
to the report by Capability Scotland <em>An Open or Shut Case? - How Scotland meets 
the needs of disabled tourists</em> by taking action to remedy the defect which 
the report identifies in the system for informing people with disabilities about 
the many facilities which are suitable for them.</P><P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan, 
Ms Sandra White</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3535</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Decline 
of the Daily Record</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament regrets the decline of the 
<em>Daily Record</em> newspaper in relation to quality, honesty, objectivity and 
standards of reporting; notes the rapidly declining paid sales of the <em>Daily 
Record</em>; believes that this is directly related to the poor and unprofessional 
stewardship of its editors, particularly that of the current editor Peter Cox; 
recognises the sharp decline in standards and, consequently, in sales since the 
appointment of Peter Cox; further believes that his use of the paper to denigrate 
and conduct personal vendettas against individuals is both cowardly and unprofessional; 
further notes the employment record of Peter Cox, who was formerly assistant editor 
of <em>The Sun</em> newspaper between 1983 and 1994 and who, during that time, wrote 
numerous articles and editorials supporting Mrs Thatcher and her government; notes 
that, during this same period, <em>The Sun</em> supported Mrs Thatcher&#146;s vicious 
war against the miners, denigrated lone parents regularly and referred to European 
citizens as &quot;krauts&quot;, &quot;wops&quot; and &quot;frogs&quot;; further 
notes that, before working for <em>The Sun</em>, he worked for a white South African 
paper under the vile apartheid regime and that after his eleven years at <em>The 
Sun</em> moved on to become deputy editor of the <em>New York Post</em> but only 
lasted five months there and was criticised by one executive for trying to turn 
the <em>New York Post</em> into an American version of <em>The Sun</em>; regrets the 
performance of Mr Cox since coming to Scotland, where his mistakes include denouncing 
a child witness as a liar the day before a Children&#146;s Panel hearing, for 
which the <em>Daily Record</em> was found guilty of contempt of court in 1999, and 
crass coverage of, for example, the heroin addiction of the daughter of Donald 
Dewar&#146;s chief of staff, the premature birth of Gordon and Sarah Brown&#146;s 
daughter and the murder of asylum seeker Firsat Dag, which generated widespread 
condemnation from across Scotland and, in particular, from ethnic minority communities; 
further notes the 70,000 a day reduction in sales of the <em>Daily Record</em> since 
Peter Cox became editor and believes that the language used to describe democratically 
elected politicians is crass, abusive and alien to the high journalistic standards 
normally associated with Scottish newspapers, and believes that the Trinity Mirror 
Group in London, owners of the <em>Daily Record</em>, should examine seriously the 
decline in standards within the <em>Daily Record</em> under the editorship of Peter 
Cox before the catastrophic drop in sales and journalistic standards becomes terminal.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3534</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace: Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament agrees that the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill 
be passed.</P><P>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran, Dr Richard Simpson, Hugh Henry</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3531 
Friends of the Earth Scotland - Green Office</STRONG> (lodged on 1 November 2002) 
Dennis Canavan<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3525 Misuse of Fireworks</STRONG> 
(lodged on 31 October 2002) Dennis Canavan<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Pauline McNeill<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Karen Gillon<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Shona Robison<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3522#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Johann Lamont: Regulation of Private Security Firms</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with concern the lack of regulation of private security firms 
and the potential impact of unscrupulous activity by these firms on the safety 
and peace of mind of local communities within Glasgow Pollok constituency, across 
Glasgow and throughout Scotland; further notes the serious danger posed by any 
activity that undermines the confidence of the public in the police's capacity 
to deal with criminal behaviour within communities, and considers that the Scottish 
Executive, along with local authorities, the police and other relevant agencies, 
should develop as a matter of urgency means by which private security firms can 
be regulated and their activities scrutinised.</P><P>Supported by: Brian Fitzpatrick, 
Tommy Sheridan, Bill Butler, Johann Lamont, Christine Grahame, Donald Gorrie, 
Mr Michael McMahon, Scott Barrie, Dr Sylvia Jackson, Mr Lloyd Quinan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3508# 
Osteoporosis</STRONG> (lodged on 28 October 2002) Fergus Ewing<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>S1M-3504# Provision of Dedicated Mother and Baby Services for Women with 
Post-Natal Depression</STRONG> (lodged on 25 October 2002) Brian Fitzpatrick<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>S1M-3416#</STRONG> <STRONG>Shona Robison: Licensing Scheme for Fireworks</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">agrees with the view of the Association of 
Chief Police Officers Scotland in calling for the tightening up of legislation 
relating to the sale and use of fireworks; notes that the association specifically 
refers to a need for sellers to be stringently vetted in order to ensure that 
applicants for a certificate to sell fireworks are of good character and should 
be required to show "need" before being granted a certificate; believes that the 
best way of achieving this is through the introduction of a licensing scheme for 
vendors of fireworks, and considers that the Scottish Executive should, as part 
of the current review of licensing powers under the Civic Government (Scotland) 
Act 1982, consider extending licensing powers to include firework vendors.</A></P><P>Supported
