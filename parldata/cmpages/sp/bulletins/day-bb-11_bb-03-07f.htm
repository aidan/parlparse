<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-8079 Jamie McGrigor: Congratulations to 2010 Lantra Land-based and Aquaculture Learners of the Year Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the winners named at the 2010 Lantra Land-based and Aquaculture Learners of the Year Scotland awards ceremony on Thursday 3 March 2011; commends Scott Simpson, who scooped the top prize as overall learner of the year; notes that there were 25 prize winners in all aged 15 to 29 in a range of categories including those for learners in agriculture, aquaculture, equine and trees and timber; considers the work of Lantra in Scotland to be very important in providing high-quality skills, training and education for what are considered to be Scotland&rsquo;s vital land-based industries and aquaculture, and wishes all the winners every success in their future training and careers.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-8027 Robin Harper: Seal Culls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Government has just issued licences to shoot up to 1,300 seals in 2011 where it is considered that they present a threat to fish farms; recalls that, under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, culling to control seals is a solution of last resort; considers that 80% of fish farms have not complied with guidance to the effect that non-lethal methods of controlling seals, including acoustic warnings, precautionary siting and double netting, should be employed if there is a danger of seal predation, and urges the Scottish Government to include current advice in regulation in order to reduce the perceived requirement for shooting licences and to consider producing a long-term plan to introduce closed containment for all fish farming activities in Scotland, whether land or sea based.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-8026 John Wilson: Youth Health Day @ Chryston Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Chryston High School on the success of its recent Youth Health Day @ Chryston event, held on 26 February 2011, to encourage healthy living for young people; applauds the hard work that it considers was put in by the event organisers and all who assisted in making the day such a success; notes that this event was supported and funded by NHS Lanarkshire and the Northern Corridor Community Forum, and acknowledges the widespread support from the people who turned out for the event, local groups, local health-related agencies and children and families from the local communities in the northern corridor.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-8025 Margaret Mitchell: Hamilton College and Scottish Opera</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hamilton College&rsquo;s J6 and J7 pupils on their recent performance of <em>Scotland, Our Scotland!</em>; notes that this was part of Scottish Opera&rsquo;s Primary Schools Tours 2011-13 programme; acknowledges that Scottish Opera works with approximately 20,000 children annually by touring with three different shows for pupils in P5 to P7 covering subjects such as identity, citizenship, energy and geography; notes that the moral of <em>Scotland, Our Scotland!</em> is that much more can be achieved by working together instead of against each other; considers that this was an excellent performance providing a high quality experience for the children and that, by working with professional musicians and technicians and their props and equipment, it developed their singing, movement and performance skills, and hopes that many other schools will be able to enjoy the Scottish Opera experience and that the Hamilton College pupils will be inspired to continue acting, singing and performing.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-8024# Willie Coffey: The Co-operative Model, Born in Fenwick, 14 March 1761, Still Flourishing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 250th anniversary of the founding of the Fenwick Weavers Society in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun village of Fenwick as a significant milestone in the development of co-operative enterprises in Scotland and throughout the world; welcomes plans to recognise the founding of the society, which was recorded in the signing of a charter in Fenwick Parish Church on 14 March 1761, in a range of projects organised by the modern-day Fenwick Weavers Society in co-operation with East Ayrshire Council and with the support of a wide range of funders; notes that the projects will include the building of a commemorative wall on the spot in Fenwick where the weavers held their parliament and by the signing of a modern Fenwick Charter, to take place in the same church on 14 March 2011; further notes that the Fenwick Weavers Society has been described as &quot;the oldest example of distributive Co-operation of which there is documentary evidence&quot; and also as &quot;probably the pioneer of what is now described as the &lsquo;Co-operative supply association&rsquo;&quot;; highlights that among those signing the Fenwick Charter will be Scots from all walks of life including Scotland&rsquo;s growing co-operative sector, representatives of UK co-operative bodies, including Co-operatives UK and the Co-operative Group, the president and director general of the International Co-operative Alliance and a representative of the MONDRAGON Corporation, a co-operative group founded in 1956 that now has over 85,000 employees and plants in 18 countries, the largest business group in the Basque Country and seventh largest in Spain; applauds the fact that the worldwide co-operative movement, of which the early roots are in Fenwick, now brings together over one billion members, providing in excess of 100 million jobs, and considers that, in addition to being an important part of Scotland&rsquo;s history, co-operative enterprises offer Scotland a viable, efficient and accountable means of organising to produce goods and services for their members, for the wider Scottish community and for export.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7898# Duncan McNeil: 30th Anniversary of the Lee Jeans Sit-in</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament remembers the 240 women who staged what it sees as a historic sit-in at the Lee Jeans factory in Greenock 30 years ago, beginning on 5 February 1981; notes that the workers barricaded themselves into the canteen for seven months in protest at the decision to close the factory; salutes the workers for capturing the imagination of the whole country and achieving a landmark victory against a US multinational; wishes the former convener, Helen Monaghan, and machinists, Margaret Wallace and Catherine Robertson, well for the 30th anniversary reunion event that they have organised, and considers the Lee Jeans sit-in to be an inspiration to women workers all over the world.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7806# Sarah Boyack: Edinburgh Employment Services Face Funding Cut</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with surprise and concern the unexpected decision by the Minister for Housing and Communities to cut support for highly-regarded specialist programmes, valued this year at &pound;2.238 million, to the Capital City Partnership; understands that this support assists 3,500 unemployed people per year; notes that this cut will hit what it sees as the most disadvantaged communities in the city, including unemployed school-leavers and priority groups such as people recovering from addiction and homeless people; notes also that it will impact on the Joined Up For Jobs strategy, which, it considers, has a strong record of partner agencies working together for maximum effectiveness; believes that Edinburgh is the only city in Scotland to have suffered such a cut and that there is no justification for singling out one city for this unfair treatment; would welcome, particularly at a time of recession, responsive local services for the unemployed being sustained, and believes that this funding should continue.</p>
