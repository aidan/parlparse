<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4089</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Scottish Hunt Crimewatch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Hunt Crimewatch, launched by the League Against Cruel Sports, Advocates for Animals and International Fund for Animal Welfare; notes their concern that some Scottish hunts may be breaking the law; welcomes the project&rsquo;s plan to pass on any evidence of&nbsp;illegal hunting to the police, and acknowledges the&nbsp;benefit of this&nbsp;campaign to the welfare of wild animals in Scotland.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4088</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill on behalf of the Justice 1 Committee:</strong> <strong>European Commission Green Papers on Applicable Law in Divorce and Succession and Wills</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concerns raised by the Justice 1 Committee in relation to recent European Commission Green Paper proposals on applicable law in divorce and succession and wills; agrees that the proposals are not in the best interests of the people of Scotland, and, in light of the Committee&rsquo;s views that these proposals are fundamentally flawed and unnecessary, calls on the Scottish Executive to urge the UK Government not to opt in to any draft European Community instruments which emerge following the conclusion of these consultation processes.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4087</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Sharon Colman on her Oscar Nomination</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Sharon Colman on her Oscar nomination for &quot;Badgered&quot; in the category of Best Animated Short Film; believes that she exemplifies the very best of new Scottish talent; considers that her parents, her local community in Haldane and her former school, the Vale of Leven Academy are justly proud of her achievements, and believes that for Sharon the best is yet to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4086</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Return to the EU Beef Market</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the return of Scottish beef to the European market; recognises that this was a result of concerted co-operation between British and Scottish Ministers and the National Farmers&rsquo; Union; believes that this was assisted by Scotland&rsquo;s reputation for producing the best quality beef, and urges the industry and the Scottish Executive to co-operate in spearheading a marketing drive.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4085</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Compensation for Public Sector Housing Relocations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the compensation levels awarded to people in public sector housing who are required to relocate have not been altered since 1973 and calls on the Scottish Executive to review immediately these compensation levels as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4084</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Withdraw Troops from Iraq</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the growing carnage, bloodshed and loss of life in Iraq and that 103 British soldiers and well over 100,000 Iraqi civilians have died as a direct result of the invasion of 2003, which many consider to be illegal and immoral; believes that the presence of British and American troops as illegal occupiers in Iraq is a huge cause of the conflict and no part of a peaceful solution, and therefore demands that all British troops are withdrawn immediately, which is the express wish of the majority of Iraqi citizens as expressed in several opinion polls, in particular those conducted by the UK Ministry of Defence.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4083</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Support Aberdeen Strikers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses solidarity with those school cleaning and catering workers employed by Aberdeen City Council who are compelled to strike for two days in pursuit of equal and fair pay; believes that the Scottish Executive must accept the responsibility to ensure that equal pay is implemented across Scotland, particularly in the public sector, and considers that the thousands of low-paid women workers who have been underpaid over the last seven years deserve full compensation for their loss of earnings.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4082</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>The End of Ivor Cutler</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the life of Ivor Cutler, poet, musician and artist, who sadly died this week after entertaining and occasionally perplexing audiences for half a century; hopes that Cutler&rsquo;s passing will not stop new generations from discovering his work and delighting in it as so many have before, and, now that the coffin is closed, hopes that he enjoys the doughnut.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4081.1</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Agriculture Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4081) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the aims for the Scottish agricultural industry set out in <em>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture: Next Steps </em>and acknowledges that the vision outlined in that document is one with which we can all agree; notes that under Scottish Executive stewardship, Total Income from Farming statistics show that returns are down by 11% and average net farm incomes have fallen by 34%, indicating that the agricultural sector is beleaguered by uncertainty and despondency, and calls on the Executive to act to restore confidence to the sector in order to reverse the current trend of young people deserting the land.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4081.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Agriculture Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4081) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the current crisis in world agriculture based on the fact that food is produced for profit and not for communities; calls on the Scottish Executive to implement a strategy that addresses poverty and hunger, manages natural resources sustainably and produces primarily for local markets rather than for export, and recognises that people in every country must have the right and ability to define their own food, farming, and agricultural policies, the right to protect their domestic markets and the right to maintain public subsidies that support economically, socially and environmentally sustainable production, ensuring safe and affordable food for all members of society, these rights being fundamental to the world&rsquo;s citizens&rsquo; demands for political sovereignty, democracy and peace.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4081.3</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Agriculture Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4081) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;and approves&quot; to end and insert &quot;and considers that this commitment should be underpinned by specific targets; further supports transparency and regulation in a food supply chain which empowers farmers through fair trading relationships; acknowledges the central role of public procurement in delivering the strategy; notes with concern that planned budgets to support organic farming are inadequate to develop its key role in Scottish agriculture, and rejects the technology of genetic modification as economically and environmentally unjustifiable.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4081.4</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Agriculture Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4081) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;and approves&quot; to end and insert &quot;while approving many of the actions outlined in the strategy, regrets the lack of support and initiative from Ministers for the farmers&rsquo; campaign to curb the power of the supermarkets and secure a more equitable trading relationship throughout the supply chain; calls for more effort to allow agriculture to compete on a level playing field by addressing the issue of inferior imports and costly red tape; further calls on Ministers to do more to promote locally produced food, especially through the use of public procurement, not only to boost the industry but to cut the number of food miles, and urges the Executive to accelerate the production of energy crops.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4080#</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Supporters Direct in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the work carried out by Supporters Direct in Scotland in promoting and supporting the concept of democratic supporter ownership and representation in Scottish football through mutual, not-for-profit structures; notes the role of Supporters Direct in Scotland in promoting football clubs as civic and community institutions and welcomes the development of Supporters Direct among Glasgow football clubs and across Scotland; further notes the contribution of Supporters Direct in Scotland to preserving the competitive values of football in Scotland through promoting the health of the game as a whole, and applauds Supporters Direct in Scotland&rsquo;s aim of helping people who wish to play a responsible part in the life of the football club they support through support, advice and information to groups of football supporters.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4074.1</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Future Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4074) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges that the development of stable, secure and sustainable future energy policy is one of the most pressing and most challenging tasks facing the present generation; recognises that any future energy policy must consider all energy and not merely electricity, which accounts for only around one-fifth of total energy demand; accepts that such a policy must take into account the twin problems of climate change and dwindling supplies of oil and other fossil fuels; welcomes the recent publication by the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) of its position paper, <em>The Role of Nuclear Power in a Low Carbon Economy</em>; supports the conclusion of the SDC that nuclear power is not the answer to tackling climate change or security of supply; further notes the results of a BBC Scotland opinion poll indicating that a majority of Scots favour more renewable energy while a small minority supports new nuclear power, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s future energy policy involves radical energy efficiency measures, the expansion of all renewable technologies, decentralised networks and the widespread adoption of microgeneration.&quot;</p>
