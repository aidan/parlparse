<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2204</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Youth Justice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the positive contribution that children and young people across Scotland make to society; believes that every young person deserves the best start in life; is committed to giving young people more positive choices and chances and removing the barriers that prevent some from realising their potential and leading successful lives; notes that there are a number of young people who do not realise their potential and get into trouble and recognises the need to intervene quickly and effectively to turn their lives around; further recognises the need to support victims of offending, and considers that communities, the third sector, the private sector, public services, local authorities and the Scottish Government need to work together to build a more successful Scotland by preventing offending and intervening early with children and families at risk.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2203</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Banknote Equality</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports efforts to end the anomalous practice whereby Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes are refused in other constituent parts of the United Kingdom or refused exchange abroad; notes the current petition, http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/banknotequality/ to the Prime Minister, which states that: &quot;We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to make it against the Law to discriminate against Scottish and Northern Irish Banknotes. As a tax paying citizen of Scotland, the United Kingdom and Europe I should not be discriminated against or offered a lower rate of exchange or charged commission or refused sale for using Scottish money in England, Europe or any foreign country or have to convert it into English notes first. I no longer find it acceptable that my elected members cannot find parliamentary time to sort out the mess of the UK currency, or deal with the discrimination that people using Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes often face. Either sort it or give us all the same currency as I fear the resentment and embarrassment felt when Scots and Northern Irish face refusal or are discriminated against with lower rates of exchange will not help with European or British unity&quot;, and urges all those opposed to this discrimination to register their support by signing up to the petition.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2202</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Nuclear Weapons Planning Application</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to apply for planning permission for a new warhead component manufacturing facility at AWE (Atomic Weapons Establishment) Burghfield, brother site to AWE Aldermaston, where nuclear warheads for the current Trident submarine fleet are assembled and refurbished; believes that this proposal should also be rejected on the grounds that in July and again in autumn 2007 the MoD took the decision to tell AWE plc to suspend all live nuclear work, including all refurbishment of the current warhead system, after the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) insisted on receiving a new licence application from AWE plc for every operation of live work on nuclear warheads and its failure by September 2007 to remedy some 400 of 1,000 health and safety defects identified in 2006; further notes that the new planning application cannot be effectively scrutinised, given the fact that the plans have a Defence Exempt Direction, which excludes consideration of key elements of the proposals, and calls on all those opposed to the further development of the Trident Nuclear Missile Programme to register their objections and call for a public inquiry in the terms referred to above at planapps@westberks.gov.uk.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2201</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>BMA Report on Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the British Medical Association on the report on climate change that it published in June 2008; recognises the contribution that many health professionals, hospitals and healthcare centres are making to reduce our impacts on the environment; calls on the Scottish Government and NHS boards to make every effort to continue this good work, aiming for all NHS boards to achieve the highest possible standards of excellence in sustainability, and further congratulates all those hospitals that are working towards the standards being set by St John&rsquo;s Hospital in Livingston, the Royal Cornhill Hospital in Aberdeen and others.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2200</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Dr Andrew Morrisson</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dr Andrew Morrisson on his contribution to church music in Aberdeen and the Scottish Episcopal Church over 25 years as Organist and Master of the Choristers at St Andrew&rsquo;s Cathedral, Aberdeen; recognises that over this time hundreds of young people have been encouraged to take part in music and develop their talents as choristers as a result of Dr Morrisson&rsquo;s enthusiasm and skills as a choirmaster and many have developed a lifelong passion for singing; recognises that Scotland has a long and proud tradition of church music and is grateful for the efforts of Dr Morrisson and all those who work to ensure a vibrant future for church music in Scotland, and wishes the choir of St Andrew&rsquo;s Cathedral well as it travels to St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral in London to sing at the Eucharist and Choral Evensong on Sunday 22 June 2008 to celebrate Dr Morrisson&rsquo;s 25 years as Organist and Master of the Choristers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2199</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Green Flag for Alness Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Alness Academy for being the first secondary school in the Highlands to receive the prestigious Green Flag award from Eco Schools Scotland, an international initiative accrediting schools that make a commitment to continuously improving their environmental performance; commends Alness Academy for improving its school environment and reducing litter and waste, as well as energy and water use, devising more efficient ways for students to travel to and from school, promoting healthy lifestyles and encouraging active citizenship of not only its students but also its larger community area, and notes finally that raising environmental awareness at the earliest ages in life is key to developing a large-scale change in citizens&rsquo; attitudes toward environmental management and their impact on the planet and, particularly, Alness Academy&rsquo;s home area of Easter Ross.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2183</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Aberdeenshire Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Aberdeenshire Council for agreeing to provide funding for new primary schools at Kinellar, Drumoak, Dunnottar, Portlethen, Inverurie, Turriff, Newmachar and Rathen and a new academy and primary school at Alford; recognises the urgent need to extend this programme to cover other secondary schools in Aberdeenshire, including new schools for Laurencekirk, Kemnay, and Ellon; notes that the previous administration provided &pound;63 million for schools in Aberdeenshire in the last Session of the Parliament alone; further notes the scepticism that has been voiced by Scotland&rsquo;s business community on the SNP&rsquo;s proposed Scottish Futures Trust, and calls on the Scottish Government to provide funding for new secondary schools in Aberdeenshire as a matter of urgency to ensure that pupils receive the best possible education.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2134</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Unacceptable Levels of Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Office for National Statistics publication, <em>Scottish Households Below Average Income 2006-07</em>, which shows some 17% of households in Scotland and 21% of children are living in relative poverty, with 12% of children living in absolute poverty; believes that these figures are morally unacceptable and represent a failure of successive UK governments to take poverty in Scotland seriously, and further believes that the Parliament and Scottish Government need the normal powers of independence, including powers over the welfare and taxation system, in order to tackle poverty in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2134.1</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Unacceptable Levels of Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2134) in the name of Jamie Hepburn, leave out from &quot;the Office&quot; to end and insert &quot;and encouragement the findings of the National Statistics publication <em>Scottish Households Below Average Income 2006-07 </em>which shows a marked decline since 1999-2000 in the number of households in both absolute and relative poverty, including a 28% decrease in relative child poverty and a 61% decrease in absolute child poverty meaning that the previous administration&rsquo;s target to halve absolute child poverty by 2010 has been met significantly ahead of schedule; believes that, while government at all levels should continue to strive to eliminate poverty completely, this progress would not have been possible without many of the initiatives by the previous administration and the UK Government, including the Sure Start programme, record increases in child benefit, the winter fuel allowance, the working families tax credit and the national minimum wage, the latter of which was finally passed in the House of Commons without the support of a single SNP MP, and is concerned that the SNP government&rsquo;s budget, passed with the Conservatives in this session of the Parliament, and its single outcome agreements with local authorities are precipitating cuts to a range of local services including homecare services for the elderly, school classes and school meals provision as well as a host of voluntary organisations providing services for some of Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable citizens, that this threatens to undo much of the progress on poverty which the report outlines and that this seriously undermines the SNP&rsquo;s case to be trusted with more powers.&quot;</p>
