          <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

          <p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3083#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Work Permit for Jason Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the decision of the Home Office to refuse to renew the work permit for Dundee United player, Jason Scotland; believes that Jason is an asset to both Dundee United, the city of Dundee and Scotland; is concerned that this decision flies in the face of attempts to bring fresh talent to Scotland through the Fresh Talent initiative, and believes that the Home Office should reconsider its decision as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3082</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>End Pregnancy Discrimination</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) Scotland which found that 54% of pregnant working women in Scotland experience discrimination and that three quarters of these women are afraid to report incidents of discrimination for fear of harming their job security; urges the Scottish Executive, in light of the depopulation crisis, to promote greater maternity rights among both public and private sector employers to ensure that this kind of discrimination does not occur; notes the massive contribution that women make to the economy of Scotland and that their future contribution to that economy is jeopardised by this form of discrimination, and further urges ministers to support EOC Scotland&rsquo;s call to deliver an end to pregnancy discrimination in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3081</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Co-operation Between the Faroe Islands and Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in recognition of the historic and geographical links between the Scottish island communities of the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney and the Faroe Islands, a self-governing territory within the state of Denmark, welcomes the transfer of the competency of broad control over foreign policy for the islands from Denmark to the Faroese parliament, the <em>L&oslash;gtingi&eth;</em>, in addition to its already extensive powers, including the power of negotiation of international agreements and treaties to suit the islands&rsquo; unique needs, and congratulates the Faroe Islands, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles on the signing of a joint statement on co-operation between the islands on 1 June 2005 to address areas of mutual interest including fisheries, aquaculture, oil, transport, infrastructure, renewable energy, broadcasting and culture.</p>
