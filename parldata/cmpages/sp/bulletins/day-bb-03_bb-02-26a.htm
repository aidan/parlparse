on Health&#151;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3944</STRONG> <STRONG>Mary Scanlon:</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Health</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges that funding for 
the NHS in Scotland has continued to increase since the Parliament was established; 
regrets, however, that this increase in funding has only come about as a result 
of an increase in the tax burden imposed on everyone in Scotland and that it has 
not led to an improvement in the service for patients, who have to wait longer 
for treatment and face the prospect of being forced to go abroad to get the treatment 
they need in a reasonable time; believes that the Scottish Executive&#146;s centralising 
approach is not working because, despite the best efforts of NHS staff, the current 
centralised, monopoly system of providing healthcare wastes too much money and 
therefore does not result in an improvement in front-line patient care, and calls 
on the Executive to match the extra investment with a sustained and coherent programme 
of reform that builds on the NHS&#146;s fundamental values of high-quality healthcare 
available to all, irrespective of their ability to pay, and seeks to realise these 
values by putting the needs and expectations of patients at the heart of the service 
by ensuring that money follows patients so that they have real choice over the 
treatment they receive, creating a partnership between the NHS and the independent 
sector so that all our facilities are used to cut waiting lists and times for 
NHS patients and devolving power to GPs and local hospitals so that NHS staff 
have far more say in how the health service is run so that it responds to the 
real needs of patients</P><DIR> <DIR> <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the 
following amendment</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3944.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Malcolm Chisholm: 
Health</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3944) in the name of Mary 
Scanlon, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes 
the further increases in the Scottish Executive&#146;s investment in health and 
health promotion announced earlier this month; notes that these extra resources 
must be balanced by reform in the NHS for full benefits to flow to service users; 
supports the on-going work to put patients at the centre of service planning and 
quality improvement in the NHS; supports the strengthening of the primary healthcare 
sector and decentralisation of decision-making; is concerned about waiting times 
for some out-patients; agrees with the priority given to tackling unacceptably 
long waits; commends the new maximum hospital waiting times guarantees for NHS 
patients given by the Executive; looks forward to further reductions in the number 
of patients waiting longest for treatment; welcomes the recent reduction in the 
number of delayed discharges from Scottish hospitals and the active collaboration 
between health and community care services in achieving this, and congratulates 
staff across the NHS in Scotland on their hard work and dedication to a highly 
regarded public service.&quot;</P></DIR></DIR><P>11:00 am&#9;Debate on Educational 
Attainment for Looked After Children&#151; </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3943</STRONG> <STRONG>Cathy 
Jamieson:</STRONG> <STRONG>Educational Attainment for Looked After Children</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament recognises that young people looked after by local authorities 
require support to enable them to have the best possible educational opportunity; 
welcomes the use made of the £10 million allocated to local authorities to support 
educational attainment of looked after children, and notes that, while progress 
has been made on implementing the recommendations made in <EM>Learning With Care</EM>, 
continued effort must be made to ensure that every looked after child has an appropriate 
care plan, including a plan for education, and is in full time education provision 
appropriate to need and that staff in social work and education work together 
to support all looked after children to reach their full potential</P><DIR> <DIR> 
<P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3943.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Irene McGugan: Educational Attainment for Looked After Children</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3943) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, <A NAME="AmendmentText">leave 
out from &quot;the use&quot; to end and insert &quot;funding and other initiatives 
to improve attainment of looked after children; regrets, however, that progress 
has been so slow, particularly as the Scottish Executive has brought this and 
associated issues with regard to looked after children to debate in the Parliament 
on no less than four previous occasions; recognises that the issues cannot be 
resolved without adequate qualified staff in the system; supports wholeheartedly 
better integrated children&#146;s services but suggests that the Executive desist 
from blaming local authorities and local authority staff for the problems caused 
by its own and previous governments&#146; policy failures, and therefore urges 
the Executive to acknowledge and address the financial and staffing pressures 
that local authorities face every day in attempting to meet their statutory duties.&quot;</A></P></DIR></DIR><P>2:00

<STRONG> Angus MacKay:</STRONG> <STRONG>Ethical Investment</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the work of Edinburgh University People and Planet group 
and the decision of the Edinburgh University Students&#146; Association to endorse 
overwhelmingly a motion on ethical investment during its general meeting; congratulates 
students that have chosen to highlight the issue on the university campus by campaigning 
that the University of Edinburgh&#146;s investments of £160 million should be 
invested only in ethical companies that do not flout human rights, exploit workers, 
pollute heavily or irresponsibly sell armaments; welcomes the decision of the 
University Court to make available previously confidential information about investments 
as a first step in achieving these aims but considers that the University of Edinburgh 
should go further by developing a fully accountable ethical investment policy, 
and believes that other universities in the United Kingdom should develop similar 
policies based on the shared values of their staff and students. </P></DIR><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
