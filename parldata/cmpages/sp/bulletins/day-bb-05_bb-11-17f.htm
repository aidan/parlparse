<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions  and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on  which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments  lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin  every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains  any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the  Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked  with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3592 Mike Pringle: Every  Penny Counts for Mature Students&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament supports the Edinburgh  University Students&rsquo; Association&rsquo;s &ldquo;Every Penny Counts&rdquo; campaign; supports its  call that tertiary education should be truly accessible to all students  irrespective of age; notes that every penny does count when dealing with  student debt and is disappointed that Lothian Buses discriminates against  full-time students over the age of 25 by refusing to issue them with student  ridacards, and calls on Lothian Buses to reverse this decision.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3591 Scott Barrie: Investing  in Our Children&rsquo;s Future&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the Scottish launch of  the Fostering Network&rsquo;s and British Association for Adoption and Fostering&rsquo;s  publication, <em>The Cost of Foster Care</em>;  commends the work done by all of those involved in producing this report; notes  the gap in funding that exists in Scotland regarding payments to approved foster  carers, and considers that all foster carers in Scotland should receive a  uniform fostering allowance that fully covers the cost of the care that they  provide.</p>
<p>Supported  by: Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Jamieson<strong>*</strong>,  Elaine Smith<strong>*</strong>, Helen Eadie<strong>*</strong>, Janis Hughes<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3590 Dr Jean Turner: Local  Authority Environmental Services Fail to Clean Up Deprived Neighbourhoods&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament condemns local authorities who fail to clean up  deprived neighbourhoods as indicated in a research study by the University of  Glasgow, published recently by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation; notes that the  research, which was based on a survey of 49 local authorities&nbsp;and detailed  work in four areas, highlighted that residents in deprived neighbourhoods are  getting lower standards of street cleaning and refuse collection services than  residents in more affluent areas and that deprived areas have a greater range  and severity of problems, particularly regarding graffiti, litter, fly-tipping  and poorly maintained public spaces; further notes that, despite the greater  problems faced by such neighbourhoods, local authorities are not deploying  levels of services and resources which are sufficient to meet their needs;  notes that responsible residents living in deprived neighbourhoods, who might  previously have been motivated to take good care of their surroundings, lose  heart when environmental problems remain unresolved, and considers that the  Scottish Executive has a key role in ensuring that the most intensely  disadvantaged local authorities have the resources they need to tackle problem  neighbourhoods without jeopardising service standards elsewhere.</p>
<p>Supported  by: Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3589 Dr Jean Turner: Save  the Alexander Elder War Memorial Chapel in the Glasgow Western Infirmary&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament welcomes any effort by NHS Greater Glasgow to save the Alexander  Elder War Memorial chapel when the Western Infirmary closes in 2010-11; notes  that the chapel, which was built by John James Burnet, commemorated its 80th  year on 8 November 2005 and houses many beautiful stained glass windows and  plaques dedicated to doctors and nurses of the Western Infirmary who gave their  lives in two world wars, and therefore believes that the chapel should be  retained completely, not only because of its historical importance and beauty,  but because it is used daily by all faiths and has multi-faith pastors and nuns  and because its very existence came about as an act of remembrance for those  lost in war.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3586 John Swinburne: Scottish  Fiscal Autonomy&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should  call on the UK Government to undertake a referendum to determine whether there  is a majority of the Scottish electorate in favour of Scottish fiscal autonomy.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3585.1 Richard Lochhead: Waste  Strategy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3585) in the name of Ross Finnie,  insert at end &ldquo;notes that the key to a sustainable waste strategy is a greater  emphasis on reducing the level of waste produced; recognises that to maintain  public support and participation, waste collected for recycling should not go  to landfill; notes that municipal waste accounts for only 25% of waste and that  the other 75% comes from business and industry and accurate information on the  amount of such waste recycled is required; notes concerns over the lack of  accessible recycling infrastructure; calls for waste management support for the  small business sector, and recognises that, for any waste strategy to be truly  effective, Scottish ministers require the necessary political powers to ensure  they have all options available to them, including measures relating to  manufacturing, design and taxation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3585.2 Alex Johnstone: Waste  Strategy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3585) in the name of Ross Finnie,  leave out from first &ldquo;welcomes&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;believes that the Scottish  Executive&rsquo;s policy on waste is failing and that the amount of waste being sent  to landfill is increasing, so that local authorities will have to double their  recycling performance in one year to meet the 2006 targets, and further  believes that after six years the Executive needs to take immediate steps to  free up local authorities to enable them to deliver innovative and appropriate  solutions to suit their local circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3585.3 Shiona Baird: Waste  Strategy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3585) in the name of Ross Finnie,  leave out from &ldquo;implementing&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;improving Scottish recycling  and composting rates but acknowledges that, in spite of these improvements,  Scotland still lags behind many of our European partners and that the overall  volume of waste being created continues to rise; notes that there is a wide  variation in recycling rates across Scottish local authorities and strongly  believes that access to comprehensive recycling facilities should not be a  postcode lottery; commends the efforts of the public in rising to the challenge  of recycling an increasing proportion of their waste in spite of often poor facilities  and lack of clear information; expresses concern that many Scottish businesses  and community groups engaged in recycling have found their efforts thwarted by  inappropriate levels of regulation and heavy financial costs, and believes that  a policy of zero waste, bringing environmental, economic and social benefits,  is the only truly sustainable way to tackle Scotland&rsquo;s throwaway culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3584.1 Mrs Nanette Milne: Dentistry&mdash;</strong>As  an amendment to motion (S2M-3584) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, leave out  from &ldquo;endorses&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;is further concerned that the Scottish  Executive&rsquo;s initiatives will not entice dentists back to the NHS; recognises  the increased support in dental education, employment of overseas dentists and  financial packages enacted by the Executive but sees this as a stopgap solution  which will do nothing to stem the tide of dentists leaving the NHS in the  future; calls for more initiatives for dentists to undertake preventative work,  a reduction in bureaucracy and for the Executive to create a more genuine and  innovative debate on the future of dentistry, and further calls on the  Executive to engage positively with the wider profession to ensure that reforms  and initiatives enable every patient to have access to a dentist.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3584.2 Shona Robison: Dentistry&mdash;</strong>As  an amendment to motion (S2M-3584) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, leave out  from &ldquo;welcomes&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;acknowledges the vital contribution which  NHS dental services make to health improvement and patient care; believes that  to progress implementing <em>Improving Oral Health and Modernising NHS Dental  Services in Scotland </em>requires the co-operation of the dental profession,  and therefore urges the Scottish Executive and the British Dental Association  urgently to reach agreement on the definition of &ldquo;NHS commitment&rdquo; in order to  secure the future of NHS dentistry in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3584.3 Carolyn Leckie: Dentistry&mdash;</strong>As  an amendment to motion (S2M-3584) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, leave out  from &ldquo;welcomes&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;regrets that inequalities in dental health  status and access to dental services persist; believes that NHS dental  provision is under serious threat; further believes that radical action in  recruitment and widening of access to dentistry training is urgently required,  and believes that the dentists whom the state educates and trains should be  required to give a minimum commitment to NHS service of five years, within an  agreed NHS salaried career structure.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3553*#* Jackie Baillie: The Thistle Travel Card Scheme&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates  Enable, together with a consortium of Scottish charities including Down&rsquo;s  Syndrome Scotland and Alzheimer Scotland, for its work to introduce the Thistle  Travel Card; welcomes the support of the Scottish Executive and transport  companies for the implementation of the scheme, including in Dumbarton, Vale of  Leven and Helensburgh; acknowledges that many people with learning or physical  disabilities, as well as those with dementia and epilepsy, may experience some  difficulty in using public transport; considers that the Thistle Travel Card  provides them with additional assistance by alerting travel staff to their  particular needs; notes that awareness of the scheme is limited, and considers  that the Scottish Executive and transport companies should actively promote  awareness and uptake of the Thistle Travel Card.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3190*#* Jim Mather: Supply of Affordable Housing in Rural Areas&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament considers  that new pension rules to be introduced in April 2006 allowing funds from  self-invested personal pension plans to be invested in residential property,  such as buy to let or holiday homes with up to 40% tax relief, and allowing  residential property already owned to be moved into pensions schemes will  reduce the availability of affordable housing, particularly in rural areas,  such as the Highlands, where young people are already facing difficulties in  finding housing to buy or rent, and considers that the Scottish Executive and  UK Government should reconsider the proposals, taking into account the  particular issues surrounding rural housing in Scotland, and should exempt housing  in Scotland from these new pension provisions.</p>
