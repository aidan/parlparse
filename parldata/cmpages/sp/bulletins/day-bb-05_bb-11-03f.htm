<p><b>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&#117;
  ).Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</b></p>

<p><b>*S2M-3511</b> <b>Hugh Henry:</b> <b>The Draft Civil Partnership (Jurisdiction and Recognition of Judgments) (Scotland) Regulations 2005</b>&mdash;That the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the draft Civil Partnership (Jurisdiction and Recognition of Judgments) Regulations 2005 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson<b>*</b></p>
<p><b>*S2M-3510</b> <b>Tavish Scott:</b> <b>The Draft Regional Transport Partnerships (Establishment, Constitution and Membership) (Scotland) Order 2005</b>&mdash;That the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that the draft Regional Transport Partnerships (Establishment, Constitution and Membership) (Scotland) Order 2005 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran<b>*</b></p>
<p><b>*S2M-3509</b> <b>Bill Butler:</b> <b>Announcement of Clydesdale Bank Branch Closures</b>&mdash;That the Parliament deeply regrets the decision announced by the National Australia Bank Group on 2 November 2005 to close 11 full-time and 21 part-time branches between 10 January and 30 March 2006; notes that the closure of branches will prove detrimental to economic activity and will damage the affected communities; believes that the negative impact of this decision will prove most severe in less prosperous areas, and calls on the National Australia Bank Group, even now, to reconsider its decision, especially where a closure would leave a community without any local bank.</p>
<p>Supported by: Pauline McNeill<b>*</b>, Margaret Smith<b>*</b></p>
<p><b>*S2M-3508</b> <b>Colin Fox:</b> <b>Scotsman Journalists Sacked</b>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Scotsman newspaper group to sack seven of its journalists on its daily and Sunday titles; notes with concern that the decision comes on the back of recent assurances to the National Union of Journalists that there would be no compulsory redundancies during this phase of cutbacks, and believes that falling sales at <i>The</i> <i>Scotsman</i> are the consequences of decisions taken by the editor and management and that it is therefore they who should shoulder the full responsibility.</p>
<p><b>*S2M-3507&#117; </b> <b>Colin Fox:</b> <b>Scotland&rsquo;s Social Housing Provision</b>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that affordable social housing is in short supply across Scotland in both rural and urban areas and welcomes all efforts to ensure that everyone gets the opportunity to live in a decent home fit for the 21st century; welcomes the decision of Midlothian Council, for example, to build 1,000 new council houses; urges all council tenants in Edinburgh to make their views known in the stock transfer referendum scheduled for later this month, and believes that local tenant-led participation is crucial to the effective democratic management of social housing projects all across Scotland.</p>
<p><b>*S2M-3506</b> <b>Patricia Ferguson:</b> <b>London Olympics Bill - UK Legislation</b>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that those provisions in the London Olympics Bill which relate to the arrangements for staging Olympic football matches at Hampden and the prevention of ticket touting and which are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, including those which confer powers on the Scottish Ministers, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran<b>*</b></p>
<p><b>*S2M-3505</b> <b>Richard Lochhead:</b> <b>Save the Raeden Centre</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the current uncertainty surrounding the future of the Raeden Centre in Aberdeen, which caters for pre-school children with special needs; further notes that the centre could be broken up into separate units under the recommendations of the Foster and Spalding report on the provision of pre-school services in Aberdeen, commissioned by NHS Grampian and Aberdeen City Council; believes that, while diagnosis, assessment, treatment, education and support are more important than bricks and mortar, the centre has developed something truly special which would not be easily replicated if it was broken up; notes the Save The Raeden campaign which is being run by the <i>Evening Express</i> and which has attracted huge support from the people of the north east; further believes that any moves to break up the centre into separate units would be nothing short of an act of vandalism, and considers that any replacement option should consist of a new stand-alone unit to prevent the fantastic efforts of the staff and the ethos of the centre from being irreparably damaged and potentially lost.</p>
