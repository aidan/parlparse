<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5250&diams; </strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Epilepsy Scotland, 55th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the leading charity, Epilepsy Scotland, on its 55th anniversary; notes that, since its inception in 1954, the organisation has been working with people living with epilepsy to ensure that their voices are heard, providing vital services, support and information through the decades for the nearly 40,000 Scots with this serious neurological condition, their families, carers and related professionals; acknowledges the contribution that Epilepsy Scotland has made to the development of managed clinical networks that aim to maximise scarce NHS resources and encourage best practice to address a 20% to 30% misdiagnosis rate; applauds the successful lobbying to make free travel cards more accessible to people with epilepsy and recent campaigns to increase the number of epilepsy specialist nurses in Scotland and ensure consistent prescribing of epilepsy medication rather than generic substitution by pharmacists in 2010; recognises the impact of awareness-raising activities to tackle social stigma and discrimination associated with epilepsy through the organisation&rsquo;s provision of a teachers&rsquo; guide to epilepsy, new later-life and epilepsy guidelines for GPs and employer of the year and journalist of the year awards; further congratulates Epilepsy Scotland for attracting the largest MSP support for the Cross-Party Group on Epilepsy and on keeping epilepsy high on the political agenda, and wishes the charity well with plans to offer new services that will develop the full potential of children and young adults who have difficult-to-control epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5249</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Be a Hero and Help our Heroes, Shoebox Appeal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds Glasgow-based High Access Rescue Team ahead of the launch of its Shoebox Appeal in association with the charity Help for Heroes, which will collect boxes filled with much-needed practical items to send to the troops serving in Afghanistan over the Christmas period, and calls on MSPs and all who work in the Scottish Parliament to lead the appeal with enthusiasm and to send an early Christmas message from Holyrood to the men and women who so bravely serve in the forces overseas that they are foremost in the nation&rsquo;s minds and are not forgotten over the festive period.</p>
<p>Supported by: Aileen Campbell<strong>*</strong>, Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-5248</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Pensioners Action Group (East) Celebrates Silver Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Pensioners Action Group (East) on its 25th anniversary celebrations, which will take place on 28 November 2009 at Whiterose Hall, Parkhead; commends the group on its fantastic work in championing pensioners&rsquo; rights and providing advice and information to older people in the east end, and wishes it every success for the next 25 years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5247</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Kleinwort Benson</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement by Kleinwort Benson of the company&rsquo;s intention to establish a permanent presence in Edinburgh; welcomes the decision to open new offices and invest in additional staff, and believes that the decision represents a vote of confidence in Scotland&rsquo;s financial services sector, its personnel and infrastructure.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5202</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Safety First</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the new rail service between Glasgow and Edinburgh via the Airdrie to Bathgate route and the continued electrification of the railway in Scotland; is alarmed, however, that proposals to remove the guards from this service and introduce driver only operation (DOO) are coupled with the reopening of this route; is deeply concerned that this will increase safety risks because passengers will not benefit from the protection of having a guard responsible for the safe running of the train, including controlling the doors and emergencies such as driver incapacity, failure of train safety systems and derailments; further shares the view of the STUC Women&rsquo;s Conference that the proposed introduction of DOO on the service demonstrates that the safety concerns of women passengers have not been adequately addressed; is further concerned that this decision breaches previous assurances to the trade unions that there would be no extension of DOO in Scotland and believes that this could be the thin end of the wedge leading to the removal of guards on other routes; considers that retaining the guards would cost less than the salary of First ScotRail&rsquo;s highest-paid director and less than 5% of the company&rsquo;s most recent post-tax profits, and therefore urges the Scottish Government and First ScotRail to put safety and passengers before profit and keep guards on these services.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5201</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>2009 Trad Music Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the 2009 MG ALBA Scots Trad Music Awards ceremony will take place on 28 November 2009 at the DG One venue in Dumfries; recognises that the awards aim to showcase Scotland&rsquo;s wonderful traditional music in all its forms and create a high-profile opportunity to raise media and public awareness of the music and music industry; further notes that the event has completely sold out, with an expected audience of 900 people, and wishes the wide range of talented artists and musicians shortlisted for awards the very best of luck.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5200</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Caldervale Remembers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff and pupils of Caldervale High School in Airdrie on their Caldervale Remembers service; recognises the benefits of a cross-curricular approach to the commemoration of those who have died in conflicts, whereby their lives and sacrifices are celebrated in poetry, music, drama and visual arts, and believes that it is important that today&rsquo;s young people recognise and commemorate the sacrifices of previous generations.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5159#</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>World Aids Day and Annie Lennox</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of World AIDS Day on 1 December 2009 and its aim of highlighting the challenges and consequences of the HIV epidemic around the world, particularly the impact on development in sub-Saharan Africa; acknowledges that UNAIDS estimates that there are now 33.2 million people living with HIV, including 2.5 million children; notes that around half of all people who become infected with HIV do so before they are 25 and die before they are 35; congratulates all those individuals and organisations in Scotland that campaign to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and provide practical support to HIV/AIDS victims, wherever they live; congratulates, in particular, Annie Lennox on the continued success of her SING campaign, which will be two years old on 1 December, and believes that positive consideration should be given to her recent offer to support the Scottish Parliament in its international development work, with an ambassadorial role.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5148.1</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Concern over the Future of Glencraft</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5148) in the name of Richard Baker, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets the closure of the Glencraft factory in Aberdeen; recognises, however, the seriousness of the situation that Glencraft was facing, with losses of &pound;70,000 a month despite investment from Aberdeen City Council of &pound;7 million since 2001, and welcomes the steps taken by the First Minister in meeting the management and workers of Glencraft as well as council officials and supports the efforts of the Scottish Government, in conjunction with its partners, to assist the workforce in finding new employment.&quot;</p>
