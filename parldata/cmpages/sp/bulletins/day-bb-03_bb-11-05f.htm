          <P><strong>*S2M-560</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Future 
            of Scottish Agriculture</strong>-That the Parliament calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to apply the Precautionary Principle and adopt 
            the most legally restrictive policy, regardless of Her Majesty's Government's 
            position, in relation to GM crops in recognition of the significant 
            danger that they pose to GM-free conventional and organic farming 
            and the potential risks to human health, animal health and the environment.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-559</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Sustainable 
            Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive's 
            intention of placing the environment and sustainable development at 
            the heart of all of its policy making; notes, however, the policy 
            contradictions, including those in <em>A Partnership for a Better 
            Scotland</em>, which indicate that this goal is not likely to be achieved, 
            and therefore calls on the Executive to integrate sustainable development 
            within all of its policy making and organise government to achieve 
            this end.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-558</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for the Firefighters</strong>-That the Parliament offers full support 
            to Scotland's firefighters who are being denied their full pay settlement 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to intervene with COSLA to secure 
            implementation of this rise.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-557</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Compulsory 
            Daytime Use of Headlights</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the 
            European Union to drop its plans for compulsory daytime headlight 
            use for all road users; believes that such plans are not in the best 
            safety interests of vulnerable road users such as cyclists and motorcyclists, 
            and further believes that this measure would lead to an increase in 
            fuel consumption.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-556</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Common 
            Agricultural Policy Reform</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 
            CAP Reform Agreement of June 2003 as a good deal for Scotland; endorses 
            the objectives of the strategy document <em>A Forward Strategy for 
            Scottish Agriculture</em>, widely agreed by stakeholders, as providing 
            the strategic focus for decision-making on the various flexibilities 
            available to Scotland within the agreement; endorses the wide and 
            open consultation which the Scottish Executive has now launched to 
            canvass views across the whole range of stakeholders before final 
            decisions are taken, and further welcomes the Executive's initiative 
            in setting up a stakeholder group comprising representatives of a 
            wide range of stakeholders, farming, industry, consumer and environmental, 
            to advise on the consultation process.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-555#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>MS 
            Standards of Care</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the lobby 
            of MSPs to take place on 19 November 2003 by MS Scotland and people 
            affected with MS; recognises that in the last four years progress 
            has been made in the provision of services to people with MS, but 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should develop for people with 
            MS a standard that will ensure that the level of treatment, support 
            and care will be the same regardless of where in Scotland they live.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-553#</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>European 
            Parliament Seat Numbers</strong>-That the Parliament notes the reduction 
            of UK seats in the European Parliament from 87 to 78 to accommodate 
            enlargement of the EU; welcomes the accession of 10 new countries 
            in 2004; believes, however, that Scotland, with no seat on the Council 
            of Europe, no Commissioners and fewer MEPs than comparably-sized independent 
            member states, has little enough influence in the EU, and therefore 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should resist the reduction in 
            Scotland's MEPs from eight to seven.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-552#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Alternatives

            building of a second Forth road bridge would do nothing to solve the 
            problems of increasing traffic congestion in Fife and Lothian and 
            further believes that these problems could be tackled through a range 
            of other measures including rail infrastructure improvements, starting 
            with an upgrade of the inadequate signalling system of the Forth Rail 
            Bridge and, in the longer term, a reopening of the rail line from 
            Dunfermline to Alloa to alleviate freight congestion on the central

            organisations that made the event possible, including Glasgow Anti-Racist 
            Alliance, Glasgow City Council, the Scottish Arts Council, Glasgow 
            Film Theatre and the Glasgow Science Centre, for their commitment 
            and support; recognises the importance of the event in highlighting 
            the important contribution of black people to Glasgow's cultural, 
            artistic, political, economic and social identity, and notes the important 
            work carried out by the Glasgow Anti-Racist Alliance in challenging

            the Parliament notes that residents in parts of the Highlands and 
            Islands do not receive independent terrestrial TV channels unless 
            they purchase an encryption card from BSkyB on a regular basis; further 
            notes with concern that access to terrestrial channels in those communities 
            with analogue relay systems will be removed when the analogue signal 
            is switched off in 2010; believes that TV license payers should not 
            have to pay more because of their geographical location, and considers 
            that Her Majesty's Government should take action to ensure that all 
            UK TV license payers have unrestricted access to terrestrial TV channels.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-543</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>UK 
            Legislation - Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill</strong>-That 
            the Parliament endorses the principle of including in the Planning 
            and Compulsory Purchase Bill provisions to remove Crown immunity from 
            planning controls for development and agrees that the relevant provisions 
            to achieve this end should be considered by the UK Parliament.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-541.1</strong> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> <strong>Scotland's 
            Transport</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-541) in the name 
            of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and 
            insert &quot;regrets that the Scottish Executive's transport policies 
            continue to be driven by spin, the need for press releases and photo 
            opportunities and a determination to introduce road tolls; notes the 
            Executive's continuing failure to make any firm financial commitments 
            to significant infrastructure projects, such as the Borders rail link 
            and addressing missing strategic links in the road network; believes 
            that there is no evidence that the introduction of further bureaucracy 
            and delays to decision-making, as represented by the proposed transport 
            agency, will improve infrastructure or services, and calls upon the 
            Executive to produce detailed and costed measures with start and completion 
            dates for the major transport infrastructure programmes that the Scottish 
            economy and local communities need in the 21st century.&quot;</P>

            of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and 
            insert &quot;notes with concern the Scottish Executive's proposals 
            for improving transport in Scotland, as set out in <em>A Partnership 
            for a Better Scotland</em>, in particular its failure to give sufficient 
            support for healthy transport initiatives such as walking and cycling; 
            further notes that the finance put aside so far overwhelmingly relates 
            to encouraging road and air transport, the most polluting forms of 
            transport, and, while welcoming any extension of concessionary fares, 
            regrets the failure to promote an effective public transport system 
            in Scotland.&quot;</P>

            of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and 
            insert &quot;calls on the Scottish Executive to establish a publicly 
            owned, publicly accountable, integrated public transport system for 
            Scotland to implement free travel for older people, people with disabilities 
            and their carers and schoolchildren and further calls for this transport 
            system to be fully resourced and implemented as a matter of urgency.&quot;</P>

            in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;and the proposals&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;; notes with concern the underperformance 
            of the Executive on major transport schemes to date; notes that for 
            the new agency to be successful there must be transparency, accountability 
            and direction for Scotland on all aspects of transport policy whether 
            road, rail, marine or air, and recognises that the new agency should 
            be strategic and should not undermine the role and function of Strathclyde 
            Passenger Transport nor any future statutory regional transport authority 
            elsewhere in Scotland and that the performance of the agency should 
            be monitored to ensure that it delivers improvements to allow Scotland's 
            transport system to match those of its European competitors.&quot;</P>
