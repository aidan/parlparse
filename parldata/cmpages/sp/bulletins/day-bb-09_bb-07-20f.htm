<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4609</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>NHS Lanarkshire Youth Counselling Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the NHS Lanarkshire Youth Counselling Service for its work with young people in North Lanarkshire; recognises the important contribution made by the service in supporting young people with varying emotional and psychological issues by providing non-judgemental, objective and independent counselling, and hopes that this success is continued as the service is introduced into South Lanarkshire schools.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Jim Tolson<strong>*</strong>, Jamie Hepburn<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4608</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Reach for the Stars</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Anne&rsquo;s Primary School in Calton, Glasgow, for achieving an outstanding report from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education; recognises that, in the last two years, the school has turned itself around from a poor-performing school to one that has been highly commended for teamwork, boosting ambition and improving educational attainment; draws attention to the hard work of head teacher Louise Jarvie and all staff at the school who have worked together to overcome challenges facing the pupils, including poverty and poor health, and hopes that St Anne&rsquo;s will give hope to schools across the east end whose pupils face similar challenges and encourage them that they, too, can reach for the stars, which has quite appropriately become the school&rsquo;s motto.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4607</strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Castlemilk Community Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Castlemilk Pensioners&rsquo; Action Centre on winning the Community Champion Team Award in recognition of its work serving 500 pensioners from the local area; notes that the centre has been part of the community for over 20 years and serves up to 100 meals each day as well as providing activities and day trips to users, and wishes continued success and recognition for its excellent work in the future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bob Doris<strong>*</strong>, Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong>, Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Aileen Campbell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-4606</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen City Young Single Persons Housing Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen City Council on the results of the recent Care Commission report on the council&rsquo;s Young Single Persons Housing Project, which scored well out of six inspection areas, with two good outcomes and four very good outcomes, and recognises the efforts of the council&rsquo;s staff in helping and supporting young, vulnerable, homeless people in their time of great need.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4605</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Public Opposition to UK Government Plans to Renew Trident</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent findings of an ICM poll, carried out on behalf of <em>The Guardian</em> newspaper, that show that a majority of the UK population is now opposed to the &pound;76 billion Trident replacement programme, with 54% of voters indicating that they would prefer the UK Government to abandon nuclear weapons completely; believes that the obstinacy of the UK Government with regard to the renewal of Trident poses a major hurdle on the path towards international nuclear disarmament; considers that nuclear weapons provide little or no defence against the most immediate contemporary global security threats, namely climate change and terrorism, and, as such, calls on the UK Government to abandon immediately its misguided plans to lavish billions of pounds of scarce public resources on the renewal of this antiquated weapons system.</p>
