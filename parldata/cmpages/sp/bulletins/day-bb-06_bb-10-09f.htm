<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4936</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>Make the Connection</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes &quot;Make the Connection&quot;, the joint campaign by energywatch and the Federation of Small Businesses to achieve a better deal for small businesses from the energy market; recognises that small businesses enjoy far less protection from regulation and industry codes of practice compared with domestic energy consumers; notes the high cost of gas and electricity for non-domestic users at a time of low wholesale prices, which can cause smaller businesses to struggle, and calls on energy suppliers to recognise the importance of small businesses as a key market of the &pound;3 billion gas and electricity industry by improving the way in which they deal with small business customers.</p>
<p>Supported by: Maureen Macmillan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4935</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Fairbridge in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Fairbridge in Scotland on the publication of its latest annual review which details the excellent work undertaken by the organisation to support some of society&rsquo;s hardest to reach young people; recognises the dedication and talent that Fairbridge demonstrates in its work to support the development of those young people&rsquo;s self-esteem and personal and social skills, and encourages the Scottish Executive and other public bodies to continue to show their support for voluntary sector organisations, such as Fairbridge, by making more secure funding available to enable them to build on their services and help many more young people reconnect with their own human potential, whether through education, employment and training, or in the wider aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4934</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Serious Gas Leak</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &quot;Serious Gas Leak&quot; advertisement which appeared in national newspapers recently warning of the dangers of inaction on climate change; agrees that the only way to address the problem of climate change is to &quot;stop the leak&quot; by making immediate and dramatic cuts to our emissions of greenhouse gases; congratulates Oliver Postgate, creator of the Clangers, for posting the advert, which also highlights the unwillingness, or inability, of most politicians to make the unpopular, but very necessary, decisions to tackle climate change, and strongly believes that all politicians need to find the courage to tell the truth, both about the dangers of climate change and about the actions that are needed to address it, and that a cross-party consensus is required if this most vital of issues is to avoid becoming a political football.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4933</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Faslane 365</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Faslane 365, a civil resistance project focused in Scotland to apply critical public pressure for the decommissioning of Britain&rsquo;s nuclear weapons by a continuous peaceful blockade of the Trident base at Faslane; commends the action of women associated with Greenham Common, Aldermaston Women&rsquo;s Peace Campaign and Women in Black in the first few days of the blockade of Faslane; notes that arrests have been made as a result of non-violent protest; appreciates that groups and organisations from Scotland, England, Wales and beyond, have pledged to join the blockade in the coming months, and notes that groups interested in taking part can contact info@faslane365.org.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4932</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Highlands and Islands Food and Drink Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Highlands and Islands Food and Drink Forum for organising the Highlands and Islands Food and Drink Awards, now in their second year; congratulates all participants and award winners, such as Connage Highland Dairy of Ardersier which won two awards for its organic cheeses, and believes that the local food culture of the Highlands and Islands can go from strength to strength.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4930#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Increase in Domestic Abuse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views the increase in reported domestic abuse as very worrying, especially in light of the fact that the majority of cases involve victims who have been abused before and the emergence of &quot;legal aid deserts&quot;, areas, including Glasgow, Edinburgh and others, where victims are unable to access lawyers to take on their cases due to changes in the way civil legal aid is paid, meaning many solicitors will not take on such cases because they cannot afford to; agrees with Ranald Lindsey, convener of the Law Society of Scotland&rsquo;s Access to Justice Committee, who stated that &quot;Our consciences are basically being exploited by the Executive on this. They know that it&rsquo;s difficult for us to turn away Mrs Jones who&rsquo;s been battered black and blue, saying that we&rsquo;re not being paid enough&quot;, and believes that the Scottish Executive should address this growing problem as a matter of urgency.</p>
