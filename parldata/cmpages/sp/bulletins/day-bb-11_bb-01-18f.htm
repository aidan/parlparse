<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>

<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7723</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Scottish Enterprise Puts Commonwealth Games Legacy at Risk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply concerned by reports that Glasgow&rsquo;s 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy is under threat; is concerned that Scottish Enterprise is cutting 46% of support to six firms that are charged with driving forward urban regeneration in Scotland and that this will have a detrimental effect on the ability of Clyde Gateway to carry out Commonwealth Games legacy commitments, and urges the Scottish Government to intervene with Scottish Enterprise and request that it review the proposal to reduce funding commitments to Clyde Gateway and other urban regeneration companies in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7722&diams; </strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Hunter House Museum, East Kilbride</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the value of local history museums to Scotland&rsquo;s communities; is concerned at the potential closure of museums such as the A-listed Hunter House Museum in East Kilbride, the birthplace of the famous medical pioneers, William and John Hunter, which houses interactive displays telling the story of their lives and medical discoveries; understands that the museum is one of the few places in East Kilbride where people are able to discover more about what it sees as the town&rsquo;s rich history and heritage, and believes that a potential way forward for such facilities, should local authorities decide to close them, would be for them to be given over to community groups and trusts that show the commitment and ability to preserve such precious resources for community benefit.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7721</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Bus Service Withdrawals Affecting Duntocher, Hardgate, Faifley, Bearsden and Milngavie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the decision by First Bus to withdraw services on the 118 route between Duntocher and Glasgow except during morning and evening peak times from Mondays to Fridays; notes that services from Glasgow will terminate at Baljaffray shops at all other times; is further concerned at the withdrawal of all services from Monday to Saturday after 7pm and all Sunday services on the route and the introduction of an hourly instead of half-hourly service on the 119 route; believes that insufficient consideration has been given to the people who will be adversely affected by the changes; is of the view that working people, schoolchildren and pensioners in the Duntocher, Hardgate, Faifley, Bearsden and Milngavie areas will be greatly inconvenienced by these changes by First Bus; believes that vital routes must be protected, and supports the reregulation of bus routes in Scotland as an urgent priority.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7720</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Tackling the Gaps in Extracurricular Reading</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment<em> </em>(PISA) report, <em>PISA 2009 Assessment Framework - Key Competencies in Reading, Mathematics and Science</em>, that examined 15-year-old students&rsquo; performance in reading, mathematics and science concluded that 43% of the pupils whom it surveyed in Scotland do not read for enjoyment; expresses its concern at PISA&rsquo;s report that 27% of students read for enjoyment for 30 minutes or less per day and that boys were less likely to say that they enjoy reading than girls, and calls on the Scottish Government to take measures to improve the levels of extracurricular reading among pupils and close the apparent gender gap as a means of tackling what it believes to be Scotland&rsquo;s ongoing battle with illiteracy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7719</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant:</strong> <strong>Domestic Abuse Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7718</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Bus Service Withdrawals in the East End of Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the decision by First Bus to withdraw what it considers to be the vital 43 service in the evening and the 64 service after 7 pm on weeknights and on Sundays; believes that insufficient consideration has been given to those adversely effected by the changes; is of the view that the east end of Glasgow cannot afford to lose any more bus services; is troubled by what it considers as the easy discarding by First Group of its undertaking, made when awarded its contract, not to withdraw services; understands that this decision will disproportionately affect some of the most vulnerable people in Glasgow, and considers that bus providers should be obliged to protect all vital routes and that this serves as a further indication that the regulation of bus routes in Scotland is in need of major reform.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7717</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Discards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns what it believes to be the reprehensible, yet widespread, practice of discarding fish whereby dead or dying fish are thrown back into the sea; considers that this is utterly indefensible on environmental, economic and ethical grounds; notes that the practice occurs as a direct result of what it views as the ill-thought-out and inflexible decrees of the European Common Fisheries Policy, and believes that the Scottish Government, the UK Government, the European Commission, Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen and all other interested parties should work together to find solutions to bring about a speedy termination of discarding in Scottish waters.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7716</strong> <strong>Iain Smith on behalf of the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee:</strong> <strong>Report on the Public Sector&rsquo;s Support for Exporters, International Trade and the Attraction of Inward Investment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&rsquo;s 8th Report, 2010 (Session 3): <em>Report on the public sector&rsquo;s support for exporters, international trade and the attraction of inward investment</em> (SP Paper 485).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7715</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>M&agrave;nran</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the new Scottish Gaelic band, M&agrave;nran, made up of Norrie MacIver, Ross Saunders, Scott Mackay, Gary Innes, Calum Stewart and Ewen Henderson, has today released its first single, Latha Math, through a large number of online retailers in an attempt to become the first Gaelic band of the 21st century to make it into the UK top 40; considers that M&agrave;nran is helping to create the new sound of a modern Gaelic Scotland, and wishes the band every success for the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7714</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Fife&rsquo;s Monster Bike and Hike Challenge for Maggie&rsquo;s</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Maggie&rsquo;s Monster Bike and Hike, a 24-hour fundraising team challenge from Fort William to Inverness in aid of Maggie&rsquo;s Cancer Caring Centres taking place between 30 April and 1 May 2011; notes that the challenge, covering 73 miles along the Great Glen Way, is in its eighth year and will coincide this year with the fifth anniversary of the opening of the Maggie&rsquo;s Centre in Kirkcaldy; understands that the Monster Bike and Hike raised over &pound;600,000 for Maggie&rsquo;s Cancer Caring Centres in 2010 and that the event is an important yearly fundraising activity for the charity; notes that fundraisers are aiming to sign up 55 volunteers for Maggie&rsquo;s Fife, and encourages as many people as possible across the Kirkcaldy constituency and Scotland to take part and support their local Maggie&rsquo;s Cancer Caring Centre.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7713</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Earth Hour 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the World Wide Fund for Nature&rsquo;s Earth Hour 2011, which is scheduled to take place at 8.30 pm on 26 March 2011, and what it hopes will be the thousands of people across Scotland joining hundreds of millions across the globe in switching off their lights for 60 minutes to demonstrate support for tackling climate change; considers the implementation of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 to be a priority for the Scottish Government; welcomes the publication of <em>Low Carbon Scotland:The</em> <em>Draft Report on Proposals and Policies </em>by the Scottish Government and calls on it to ensure that policies are in place to enable Scotland to meet its annual emissions reduction target and its target of achieving a 42<strong>%</strong> reduction in overall emissions by 2020; considers that the benefits of tackling climate change will be better homes, healthier lifestyles, a much-improved public transport system and a fairer Scotland; welcomes the investment, skills and job opportunities in moving toward a low-carbon future, and calls on countries around the world to sign up to a fair, ambitious and binding global deal on climate change at the UN climate talks in December 2011.</p>
