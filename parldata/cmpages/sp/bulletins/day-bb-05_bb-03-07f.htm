         <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2529</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Aberdeenshire Sports and Recreation Facilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the inappropriate sense of priorities displayed by Aberdeenshire Liberal Democrat councillors in choosing to donate a six-figure sum to the development of swimming facilities for a city university outwith its own area while their own Mintlaw Academy has none and while Peterhead pool is in urgent need of new investment.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2528</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Climate Change Inquiry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the Scottish Executive has today launched a public consultation into the route options for the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (WPR); recognises that the WPR and other major road projects will increase traffic and increase greenhouse gas emissions that will contribute to climate change; condemns Scottish ministers for going ahead with major new road projects, including the WPR, before the Environment and Rural Development Committee has made its report to the Parliament on its inquiry into climate change; recognises that the WPR has been estimated to cost between &pound;200 and &pound;400 million whilst only reducing congestion by 2%, whereas government-commissioned research has demonstrated that improving public transport and other measures could achieve congestion reductions of 5 to 21%, giving returns of &pound;10 in reduced congestion for every &pound;1 spent; calls on the Executive to seriously consider alternatives to the WPR, and further calls on the Executive to recognise the seriousness of proceeding with projects that will contribute to climate change and to respect the Parliament by halting any decision on the WPR, at least until after the Committee has reported on its climate change inquiry.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2527</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Criminals Should Not Be Rewarded For Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the actions of the BBC in paying convicted burglar, Brendan Fearon, &pound;4,000 to appear in a BBC documentary while the victim of the burglary received no fee; believes that this is a wholly inappropriate use of the TV licence fee and that the BBC&rsquo;s actions will disgust the majority of TV licence fee payers who have no control over how the licence fee money is spent, and calls for legislation to ensure that convicted criminals cannot make money from their crimes.</p>

         <p><strong>S2M-2352.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2352) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;but, in so doing, supports the removal of private and other fee-paying schools from the artificial cover of charitable status which saves these elite institutions thousands of pounds in various taxes every year and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward amendments during Stage 2 of the Bill to achieve this objective whilst maintaining the status of independent special schools.&quot;</p>
         <p>Supported by: Colin Fox</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2352.2</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2352) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;but, in so doing, notes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to protect the National Collections&rsquo; charitable status but has concerns that Scotland&rsquo;s colleges may fall foul of section 7(3)(b), and calls for there to be a clear statement on the face of the Bill of the purpose of a charity, namely that only those organisations which have as their overriding purpose the provision of a benefit to the public should qualify for charitable status, and for the Executive to bring forward appropriate amendments at Stage 2 to this effect.&quot;</p>
         <p><strong>S2M-2319</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</p>
         <p><strong><a name="1900" id="1900"></a>S2M-1900#</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Deafblindness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the European Parliament Declaration of Rights of Deafblind people which was formally adopted on 1 April 2004 and recognises deafblindness as a distinct disability separate from hearing or sight impairment; considers that more should be done to identify, correctly assess and provide appropriate services for this unique group who cannot automatically benefit from mainstream services or services for people who are either blind or deaf, and further considers that councils should make appropriate provision for this uniquely disadvantaged group, ensuring that they have the same provision of services as outlined in the guidance issued under section 7(1) of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 for England and Wales.</p>
