          <p> <strong>*S2M-2792</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Lancastria</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 17 June 2005 will mark the 65th anniversary of the sinking of the former Clyde-built liner and requisitioned troopship, Lancastria, which was sunk by enemy action whilst loading the remainder of the British Expeditionary Force from France in 1940, five miles off the French coastal town of St Nazaire; notes that the sinking is the worst naval disaster in British maritime history, claiming the lives of more than 4,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and civilian refugees, a grim death toll greater than the combined loss of life in the Titanic and Lusitania disasters; notes and commends the efforts of the local French people during the rescue operation in assisting the survivors and tending to the burial of the hundreds of victims washed ashore in the months following the sinking; pays tribute to both the survivors and victims of the disaster, men, women and children who have been forgotten by history; notes the D-Notice banning news of the sinking ordered by Winston Churchill which effectively remains in place in the United Kingdom to this day; notes that the Shetland-born captain of Lancastria, Captain Sharp, was instructed by Royal Navy officers under orders from the Admiralty in London to load as many people as possible &quot;without regard to the limits set down under international law&quot;, loading some estimated 9,000 people on a ship which normally would carry just over 2,000, and that this was a significant contributory factor in the scale of the disaster; urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to recognise formally the sacrifice made by both victims and survivors of the Lancastria by commissioning a special Lancastria medal, following the precedent set by the Dunkirk medal, to be awarded whether <em>in vivo </em>or posthumously to all of the victims of the disaster, and asserts that this would in some small way recognise what has become a forgotten sacrifice and would offer the relatives of victims the peace of mind that their loved ones had not died in vain and were being duly, if belatedly, remembered.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-2791</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Jack Nicklaus - St Andrews Community Council Snub</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by St Andrews Community Council to snub the legendary American golfer Jack Nicklaus by denying him the title of Honorary Citizen of the Royal Burgh of St Andrews; demands clarification as to how each member of the council voted in the ballot; recommends that a new ballot should be held in public to reconsider the original decision, and, if that decision is reversed, considers that an unequivocal apology should be sent to Mr Nicklaus before he comes to St Andrews for his last ever appearance in the Open in July.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-2789</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>HIV/AIDS and the G8 Summit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the G8 summit being held in Scotland later this year provides an unprecedented opportunity to raise political debate on the impact of HIV and AIDS; congratulates the UK Government for agreeing to the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s &quot;3 by 5&quot; pledge, which aims to provide 3 million sufferers of the virus with antiretroviral medication by the end of 2005; recognises that a funding deficit of $2 billion has endangered the success of this programme, and urges Scottish ministers to work with their Westminster counterparts to ensure that HIV/AIDS issues are high on the agenda for the G8 in Scotland this July.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-2787</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Removal of the Little Princess</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is outraged by the removal of Jugder, Shinee, Evsanna and little Misheel Narantsogt from Liverpool to Mongolia on 5 May 2005; recalls that little Misheel and her family were held in Dungavel Detention Centre in Scotland and were eventually liberated and returned to Liverpool where, in a blaze of publicity, little Misheel was crowned princess of the Liverpool parade; fears that Jugder (Tso) Narantsogt&rsquo;s life and the lives of his family are now in danger in Mongolia due to his political activities as founder of a branch of the Democratic Union Party; recognises that the Home Office had sufficient evidence, including a front page article from <em>The Mongol News</em> which detailed Jugder&rsquo;s political background, to mark him out as an individual who is in danger of serious persecution; is gravely concerned for the safety and well-being of the Narantsogt family; questions the fact that such a decision could be made by the Home Office when the Westminster Parliament was dissolved, and therefore wonders who exactly has such powers during this period and how many other families were brutally removed under the cover of election day.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-2785#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Birth Rate and Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is extremely concerned that, according to Professor Michael Crawford, the incidence of low birth weight has increased since the 1970s and that in some areas of Glasgow the incidence is 14%; acknowledges that the single biggest risk factor for low birth weight is poverty; is appalled that, when government tells us that the economy is buoyant and the wealthy have more than doubled their wealth since 1997, the incidence of low birth weight in Scotland is at levels associated with the poorest countries of the world; condemns successive governments for failure to prevent this humanitarian catastrophe, and believes that the health consequences for future generations will be dire unless aggressive action is taken to redistribute wealth and eradicate poverty.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-2784#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Stop Violence Against Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the recent violent deaths of women in the context of very low conviction rates for violence against women, in particular sexual violence, and extends its concern and condolences to all the friends and families of these young women so brutally taken from the world; regrets that there remain too many outstanding, unsolved cases of murder of women; believes that reporting of these crimes stigmatises the female victims by headlines such as &quot;prostitute murdered&quot;, and further believes that all of these women are first and foremost women, daughters, mothers, sisters, partners and friends and that the focus of blame should rest on the perpetrators not the victims and that much more effort needs to be made to identify the perpetrators of these crimes and end the unacceptable level of gender-based violence in society.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-2783</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Leak of Plutonium and Uranium</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the leak of some 20 tonnes of uranium and plutonium fuel at the Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield, including, reportedly, enough plutonium to make 20 nuclear weapons; notes that the stoppage puts Thorp even further behind its promise to have 7,000 metric tons of spent fuel processed by 31 March 2004; notes that the consequent indefinite closure of the plant will cost the taxpayer over &pound;1 million per day; further notes the statement from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority that this could delay plans to tackle the problem of nuclear waste, and considers that this latest failure highlights the financial and strategic irresponsibility of Whitehall plans to embark on a new generation of nuclear plant with complete disregard to cost, safety issues, environmental risk or public concerns.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-2782</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Monaghan Mushrooms</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that, after one year, the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Environment and Rural Affairs Department has failed to conclude its investigation into the employment of immigrant workers at Monaghan Mushrooms at Fenton Barns in East Lothian and has apparently not yet determined which agencies are employing the immigrant workers; further notes that Donegal Creameries plc, associate company of Monaghan Mushrooms, owning 23% of its shares, has asked the Irish stock exchange to temporarily suspend its shares due to &quot;financial irregularities&quot;, and calls on the Executive to resolve the issues raised on behalf of both local and immigrant workers at Monaghan Mushrooms as a matter of urgency.</p>
