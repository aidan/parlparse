<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2976</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Age of Criminal Responsibility in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments made by the Lord Advocate to the Justice Committee, at its meeting on 25 November 2008, on the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland; believes that prosecuting children as young as eight in the adult courts is highly inappropriate and that such cases should always be dealt with by the children&rsquo;s hearing system, which can put in place appropriate arrangements to tackle the root causes of offending and criminality in children, including detention in secure accommodation in the most serious cases where such a decision is in the public interest; notes that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has called for the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland to be raised; notes that this age is 15 in Scandinavian countries and ranges from 13 to 18 in most other European countries, and urges the Scottish Government to consult as soon as possible on the implications of raising the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland and otherwise complying with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2975</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Aberdeen City Council on Reducing the City&rsquo;s Carbon Footprint</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen City Council for winning the Guardian Newspaper Public Services Innovation and Progress Sustainability Award for its work in reducing the city&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2974</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Learning About the Holocaust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Scottish Government that funding is to be made available for the Holocaust Educational Trust to offer pupils representing all secondary schools the opportunity to participate in visits to Auschwitz to learn about the Holocaust and encourages the Scottish Government, local government and the Holocaust Educational Trust to work together to ensure participation across as wide a range of schools as possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2973</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Towards Independence for Greenland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the people of Greenland on their historic vote for increased autonomy from Denmark; notes that some 75% of voters favoured the proposals to transfer a range of powers including those over police, courts and coastguard as well as a share of oil revenues to the island; welcomes this peaceful and democratic transfer of powers, and believes that this demonstrates that even in times of global economic uncertainty nations can move forward constitutionally.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2972</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>The Star Award for SQA Champion to Janet Allardice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Janet Allardice of Dalziel High School on being the recent recipient of the Star Award for SQA Champion for her dedication to championing SQA qualifications during her 33-year career and recognises that her inspirational guidance and commitment have touched thousands, allowing her to, amongst other things, lead her co-workers to develop higher standards in business education and prepare her students to achieve their standard grades.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2971</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Right of Suffrage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent reports about convicted prisoners having the right to vote and agrees that with rights come responsibilities but considers that when a person is convicted some rights should be removed, including the right of suffrage.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2970</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Harthill Footbridge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the new Harthill M8 footbridge; congratulates the previous Labour/Liberal Democrat administration on the work that it carried out to ensure that the new footbridge would be completed; congratulates the previous Minister for Transport, Tavish Scott MSP, for having the ambition to ensure that the bridge was built to such high design standards, and believes that it will become an iconic feature in Lanarkshire.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2969</strong> <strong>Gavin Brown:</strong> <strong>Caring Christmas Trees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the efforts of Bethany Christian Trust and congratulates it on its Caring Christmas Trees programme; notes that, through the assistance of 500 volunteers, the programme provides nearly 4,000 Christmas trees to Edinburgh and Fife residents while simultaneously raising money to provide food, shelter and advice to homeless individuals during the winter months; welcomes the fact that the programme has been franchised to Gowrie Care in Dundee, Impact Arts in Glasgow and Kibble in Paisley, and urges all those planning to purchase a Christmas tree this December to consider supporting the goals of the Caring Christmas Trees initiative to provide much-needed support to vulnerable individuals in these communities.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2968</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Peru Today, Scotland Tomorrow?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of FIFA, the international football governing body, to suspend the Peruvian national football association as of 25 November 2008, removing its right to participate in international tournaments; notes with alarm that this was triggered by excessive political intervention by the Peruvian Government, including pressure to elect a national association president of the government&rsquo;s choice; believes that there are disturbing parallels between this intervention and the pressure being exerted by the UK Government on the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish associations to accept a combined Great Britain Olympic football team, and calls on the UK Government to abandon this stance and allow all football associations on these islands to act without politically-motivated coercion.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2966.1</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2966) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;; notes with concern the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals for west coast stocks that, if implemented, could especially damage the viability of the west coast langoustine sector, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to work towards a settlement that successfully balances the need to conserve depleted west coast whitefish stocks with a thriving langoustine fishery.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2966.2</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2966) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;welcomes the work that Scottish fishermen have been taking forward with government, scientists and others over recent years to develop a more sophisticated approach to protecting cod and safeguarding fishing opportunities; recognises that the process of improving stakeholder involvement in EU fisheries policy began with the establishment of the influential regional advisory councils, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue driving forward this regionalised approach as a means of improving fisheries management decisions within the Common Fisheries Policy in the interests of sustaining stocks, Scotland&rsquo;s fishing fleet and the communities that depend on it.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2966.3</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2966) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;the Scottish Government&quot; to end and insert &quot;Team UK and in particular the positive approach taken by the new UK Fisheries Minister and the work of the Scottish Government in seeking to negotiate a deal that is fair and just for Scotland&rsquo;s fishing communities, and which will secure sustainable fisheries for Scotland, and commends the Scottish Fishermen&rsquo;s Federation&rsquo;s recent environmental statement and for the leadership and innovation being shown by Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen, demonstrating the way forward for the rest of Europe.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2966.4</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2966) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;; acknowledges that, while progress has been made in moving to more sustainable practices, these are still at a very early stage and much more work is required; understands that the scale of damage to our marine ecosystems leaves no room for any level of complacency whatsoever; recognises the huge challenges that face European fisheries ministers as they negotiate this year&rsquo;s round of fisheries talks, especially given that most of the world&rsquo;s fish stocks, including those in European waters, are low-to-endangered; believes, therefore, that it is important to undertake a suite of measures to prevent discards, such as encouraging greater use of selective fishing gear, banning of the most destructive fishing technologies, greater coverage of onboard observers, and the temporary closure of fishing grounds to prevent the capture of juvenile or spawning fish, especially to support cod recovery, no-take zones and days in port, and believes that it is important to negotiate a deal that is fair, profitable and sustainable for all of Europe&rsquo;s fisheries in order to restore all European marine ecosystems and secure sustainable fisheries for the foreseeable future.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2965.1</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>St Andrew&rsquo;s Day</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2965) in the name of Linda Fabiani, insert at end &quot;, and welcomes the example set by the ancient burgh of St Andrews in organising its own programme of events for St Andrew&rsquo;s Day, which provides an appropriate focus for the nation&rsquo;s celebrations at this time of year.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2958.1</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2958) in the name of Bruce Crawford, insert at end  &quot;but in doing so, calls on the Scottish Government not to impose any financial penalty, directly or indirectly, on any local authority that exercises its discretion not to provide school meals free of charge to all pupils in primaries 1 to 3.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2958.2</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2958) in the name of Bruce Crawford, insert at end &quot;but in doing so, recognises that this measure in itself will not deliver one free school meal and that it is the responsibility of the Scottish Government to fully fund the SNP&rsquo;s manifesto commitments; therefore calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that funding is not diverted from vulnerable groups or teaching provision in order to implement the policy of free school meals for all pupils in primaries 1 to 3, and further calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward to the Parliament early in the New Year detailed up-to-date costings for implementing its free school meals proposal.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2945</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Call for Parliamentary Scrutiny of Aid Effectiveness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates and commends the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association UK branch on its timely International Parliamentary Conference which was held between 17 and 21 November 2008 in the Palace of Westminster for 92 colleagues from across the Commonwealth and beyond on the scrutiny of the effectiveness of international aid; notes that, following the Accra High-Level Forum in September 2008, the conference debated the vital role of parliamentarians in donor and partner legislatures in holding their executives to account on international aid effectiveness and commitments made under the Paris Declaration in 2005; further notes that the conference discussed the need to enhance the capacity of partner parliaments to undertake more effective scrutiny; recognises an outreach responsibility in this Parliament to assist in strengthening the capacity of partner parliaments, and calls on the Scottish *Parliamentary Corporate Body* to seek a meeting between representatives of the Scottish Parliament and the Malawi Parliament&rsquo;s International Relations Committee with a view to mutually improving parliamentary scrutiny of the bilateral aid agreements between Scotland and Malawi.</p>
