<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3175</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Treat the Dignity with Humanitarian Dignity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the determination of the Free Gaza Movement to continue its humanitarian mission to deliver medical aid to the people of Gaza in spite of the fact that in the early hours of Tuesday, 30 December 2008, the Israeli navy attacked the motor vessel, Dignity, which was loaded with medical supplies and carried, among other civilians, doctors headed to Gaza to assist with the humanitarian crisis there, in an apparent attempt to disable the vessel and in a manner that jeopardized the lives of the 16 civilians on board; believes that neither the boat nor its passengers, doctors, journalists, members of parliament and human rights observers trying to reach the people of Gaza to deliver much needed aid to the Palestinians there constituted any kind of danger to the Israeli naval forces; further believes that any future deliveries of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza by the Dignity, duly notified in advance to the Israeli navy, Ministry of Defence, and Foreign Ministry should not be impeded in any way by the Israeli defence forces, and considers that any such attack on the vessel will be premeditated and any harm inflicted on the civilians on board will be the result of a deliberate attack on unarmed civilians.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3174.1</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities - The Scottish Government Offender Management Plan</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3174) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses concern that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals for the abolition of six-month sentences are unworkable and will not improve community safety; agrees that it is right to seek to expand the provision of tough effective community sentences and payback but that to be effective such measures must be properly resourced and that this is not the case under current national and local funding settlements, and believes that any changes to the sentencing system must put first the delivery of justice and protecting the public.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3174.2</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities - The Scottish Government Offender Management Plan</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3174) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that in some cases custody is the only appropriate disposal and prison should offer a greater opportunity for rehabilitation; believes that it is vital where community penalties are imposed that there is a much tighter and rigorous control of these orders, including making community penalties more robust and visible to the community and, in particular, to the victims of crime, and notes that only when these measures are in place will the public start to have more confidence in the criminal justice system.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3174.3</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities - The Scottish Government Offender Management Plan</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3174) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the publication on 17 December 2008 of <em>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities: Fair, Fast and Flexible Justice, </em>which sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategy to deliver a coherent offender management strategy built on a robust regime of community penalties and payback and proportionate management of offenders sentenced to prison; recognises that community sentences that are completed speedily and enforced with rigour offer greater benefits to communities and individuals than short prison sentences and that their planned expansion must be adequately resourced; calls on the Scottish Government to incorporate in its offender management strategy effective action to tackle the underlying causes of crime and factors and circumstances known to have a link with offending behaviour; reaffirms the importance of judicial independence free from executive direction, and looks forward to constructive engagement with the Scottish Government on the detailed implementation of the programme.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3173.2</strong> <strong>Gavin Brown:</strong> <strong>Homecoming and its Potential to Support Sustainable Economic Growth</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3173) in the name of Jim Mather, insert at end &quot;; recognises that ensuring a lasting economic legacy will depend on capturing information on those who visit during the Year of Homecoming with a view to creating a substantial marketing database for engaging with the diaspora Scots going forward; further recognises that individual tourism providers will be the engines of economic growth generated as a result of the Homecoming, and urges the Scottish Government to ensure that the industry be fully engaged throughout.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3173.3</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Homecoming and its Potential to Support Sustainable Economic Growth</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3173) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;further recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses its disappointment that no effort has been made to assess the climate impact of the Homecoming; considers that it is vital to shift the tourism industry away from dependence on aviation; recognises how domestic and local tourism opportunities are crucial to Scotland&rsquo;s tourism market and economy; further recognises that a significant majority of tourists visiting Scotland come here from elsewhere in the British Isles; believes that the Homecoming is likely to be both more successful and more sustainable if these more local markets are prioritised throughout 2009, and calls on the Scottish Government to publish a sustainability statement for the Homecoming, detailing the expected share of surface-based transport, the impact on greenhouse gas emissions and how the Scottish Government will prioritise local tourism marketing.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3173.4</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Homecoming and its Potential to Support Sustainable Economic Growth</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3173) in the name of Jim Mather, insert at end, &quot;and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward details of its plans to promote Homecoming in Scotland, the United Kingdom and abroad in order to achieve maximum economic benefit from the celebrations.&quot;</p>
