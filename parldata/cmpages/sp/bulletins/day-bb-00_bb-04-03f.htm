    Parliament expresses concern at the closure of the creamery on Islay and agrees that there

    landslide at an opencast mining site in New Cumnock moved more than half a mile after the
    collapse of an earth-mound; further notes that in the opinion of the mining company
    responsible, such landslips &quot;happen day and daily because of wet weather&quot;;
    believes that the current national planning policy guidelines which stipulate a minimum
    distance of 500 metres between opencast workings and housing settlements is completely
    unsatisfactory and does not protect the safety of the public, and therefore calls upon the
    Scottish Executive to review this guideline immediately and undertake an assessment of all

    potential landslips.</p>

    the views of those living in the most remote parts of rural Stirlingshire and West
    Perthshire who already face a long journey to Stirling for maternity care, and to take

    industry, working along with the construction unions and Construction Industry Training
    Board, should provide real training and apprenticeships for young men and women, work to
    improve safety and regulation in the construction industry and ensure, in conjunction with
    the Executive, local authorities, Social Inclusion Partnerships and other agencies, that
    those most excluded in society by poverty and disadvantage are provided with the
    opportunities to benefit from the jobs created by the boom in the construction industry,

    People</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the damming report by the Audit Commission in
    England on NHS provision of equipment to disabled people; considers that the adequate
    provision of aids, adaptations and equipment for disabled people is a priority; believes
    that the NHS in Scotland should ensure that services for the disabled are provided in an
    efficient and effective way to ensure that maximum benefit is gained from the available
    resources, and calls upon the Accounts Commission for Scotland to undertake a review of

    the Parliament expresses its deep concern about the increased suffering of, and lack of
    financial aid to, surviving thalidomide victims in Glasgow, Scotland and the UK; believes
    that Diageo, as the multi-national company which took over Distillers, which originally
    marketed the drug thalidomide which caused children to be born without arms or legs or
    with other severe disabilities, should aid these 456 victims urgently; notes that Diageo
    made a £2.8 billion profit in 1999, while the Thalidomide Trust had to pay £1 million in
    tax; believes that the Trust was set up inadequately and that it should not have to pay
    taxes from its income, and further believes that Diageo should intervene to alleviate this
    situation, especially given that it owns some of the most profitable companies and brand
    names in the world, including Guinness, Burger King, Häagen Dazs and various whisky
    firms.</p>

    the Parliament agrees that urgent action must be taken in the 21st century to end
    &quot;slopping out&quot; at affected Scottish prisons, particularly Barlinnie Prison,
    Glasgow which is 90% without basic sanitation; acknowledges that Barlinnie cannot start
    its third century with this stomach churning and degrading practice continuing and that
    the practice of emptying chamber pots around five times a day is not only inhumane for
    prisoners but for also for staff who supervise and who deplore the practice; notes that
    Barlinnie&#146;s high international status as an innovative prison and its excellent
    rehabilitation work is impaired seriously by the time consumed by slopping out, with
    around 400 staff hours a day wasted away from essential rehabilitation work with prisoners
    due to the security need to be on duty at sluice rooms, and urges that the money removed
    from the Scottish Prison Service budget for the Drugs Enforcement Agency must not result
    in any delay to plans to end slopping out as feared by prison officers.</p>

    about the effect that the poor quality of the A75 and the Stranraer to Ayr section of the

    crime, unemployment, poverty and poor health are increasing in Aberdeenshire and that
    current mechanisms and initiatives to alleviate these problems are hampered by the lack of
    any system to accurately measure rural disadvantage to allow effective targeting of

    ignored, and believes that a long overdue Scottish Rural Deprivation Index, a means of
    collecting local rather than region-wide data and a system which ensures fair and

    inclusive and holistic governance, this work should draw on the expertise of political
