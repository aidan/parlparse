          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1240</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: 
            UK Legislation - Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that changes to the current registrations scheme 
            for the registering of sex offenders under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 
            are proposed in amendments in the Criminal Justice and Court Services 
            Bill currently before the UK Parliament; recognises the practical 
            importance of consistency across the United Kingdom, and agrees that 
            provisions to achieve these ends should be considered in the Bill 
            by the UK Parliament.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1238</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: 
            Fuel Duty</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges that Scotland is the 
            largest oil producer in the European Union yet has the highest fuel 
            prices in the developed world; notes that the Scottish economy as 
            a whole and fuel dependent industries in particular are paying a heavy 
            price as a result of high fuel prices; recognises that both individuals 
            and entire geographic areas, in particular rural and island Scotland, 
            are suffering; further recognises that the root cause of high fuel 
            prices is taxation; notes that as a result of the recent increases 
            in world oil prices Her Majesty's Government will receive a revenue 
            windfall in excess of £4.4 billion, and therefore calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to hold a summit of interested parties to address the fuel 
            situation, introduce a package of measures to address the needs of 
            fuel dependent industries, and make urgent representations to the 
            Chancellor of the Exchequer requesting him to make an immediate cut 
            in fuel duty and give a commitment to work towards the European average.</font></p>

            congratulations to all members of the British Olympic Team, including 
            the Scots in the team, on their success in the Sydney Olympics, winning 
            a total of 28 medals, including eleven gold medals, and achieving 
            a number of personal best performances; recognises that in many cases 
            a contributory factor to the success of British competitors was funding 
            for sports activities from the National Lottery, established by Prime 
            Minister John Major, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to press 
            the Chancellor of the Exchequer to use the ending of the Millennium 
            Fund to return the share of lottery funding directed to sport, art, 
            heritage and culture from its current 16.67% share to the 20% it enjoyed

            the West Coast of Scotland suffers from the lack of a direct rail 
            link to Glasgow Airport and a Glasgow north/south rail link; notes 
            that these interrelated schemes would bring benefits to all of Scotland, 
            improving the rail accessibility of all parts of the country, and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should implement plans and make 
            available the necessary funds for the development of these schemes.</font></p>

            Committee recommends that the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Notification

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1234</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: 
            Children's and Maternal Services at Yorkhill</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes Greater Glasgow Health Board's decision to continue examination 
            of the planning issues concerning future major investment in children's 
            services, further notes the clinical and structural case for retention 
            of the child and maternal services at their existing site at Yorkhill, 
            and urges the Health Board to invest in developing the existing buildings 
            in order to ensure that the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill 
            retains its unique services at the current site for the next 30 to 
            40 years.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1233#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: 
            Day Care Centres</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive's 
            announcement that as many older people as possible should remain in 
            their homes for as long as practicable; recognises the valuable contribution 
            which day care centres throughout Scotland make to continued well 
            being of older people and the insecurity which lack of funding can 
            bring; notes the answer to question S1W-9571 by Iain Gray to Christine 
            Grahame on 18 September 2000 that the Scottish Executive has no plans 
            to make provision of day care services for older people a statutory 
            duty; however, calls upon the Scottish Executive to legislate so that 
            there is a specific statutory duty on local authorities to provide 
            day care services, and further requires that it put in place appropriate 
            funding mechanisms in order that day care centres can continue to 
            provide and develop the services which individuals and local communities 
            find essential to maintaining older people at home.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1232#</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace

            is deeply upset that yet another mining catastrophe occurred in China 
            on 27 September 2000, assures the people and government of China of 
            the humanitarian concern of Scotland's Parliament, expresses condolences 
            to the families of more than one hundred miners who died in the southern-western 
            Guizhou province; notes with alarm that 2730 Chinese miners died in 
            accidents in mines during the first six months of 2000; calls upon 
            Scottish-based mining safety experts, trade unionists and engineering 
            firms to see if links can be made with the Chinese authorities to 
            improve conditions in Chinese mines to the benefit of humankind and 
            in the spirit of internationalism and ethical trade, and further urges 
            that such persons and bodies get in touch without delay with the proposer,
