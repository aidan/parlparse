<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3514</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Smoking Kills, Irrespective of Social Class</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent study carried out by Health Scotland&rsquo;s Director of Public Health Science, Dr Laurence Gruer, and published in the British Medical Journal, which examines the long-term impact of smoking on older men and women, showing that smoking itself is a greater source of health inequalities than social position; welcomes the findings that death rates of ex-smokers were close to those of never-smokers, demonstrating that quitting does make a difference regardless of social position, and considers that this research reinforces the Scottish Government&rsquo;s stance and commitment to target smoking prevention among young people and provide effective support to encourage smokers to quit, taking us along the path to a non-smoking Scotland and improving the nation&rsquo;s public health.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3513</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions in the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill, which repeal Sections 14-20 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 and those which amend the construction contracts legislation in Part 2 of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, introduced in the House of Lords on 4 December 2008, should, insofar as they relate to matters within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or alter the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers, be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3512</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Policing and Crime Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions in the Policing and Crime Bill, introduced to the House of Commons on 18 December 2008, relating to football banning orders, extradition and the proceeds of crime, insofar as these matters fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or alter the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3499</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Launch of the Fairtrade Fortnight</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the launch of Fairtrade Fortnight 2009, which runs from 23 February to 8 March 2009; encourages the people of Scotland to support and take part in Fairtrade Fortnight, whether by simply choosing to buy fairtrade goods or through holding their own fairtrade events; acknowledges the need to raise awareness and make a positive impact on the unfair trade rules that keep two billion people, a third of humanity, in poverty, and commends the invaluable work undertaken by the Fairtrade Foundation to improve the trading position of producer organisations around the world and deliver sustainable livelihoods for farmers, workers and their communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3498</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Voice of Experience Forum Home Safety Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Voice of Experience Forum (VOEF) on its recent home safety campaign, aimed at raising awareness of cold calling, in partnership with Trading Standards and the North Lanarkshire Council Bogus Caller Task Force, and commends the work of VOEF on promoting the inclusion of older people in the community and articulating the needs and wishes of older people in North Lanarkshire.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3497</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Fairbridge Works</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the youth work charity, Fairbridge, on the vital work that it undertakes to ensure that every young person has a fair chance to succeed in life; notes the strong contribution that Fairbridge makes to the More Choices, More Chances strategy and the Curriculum for Excellence, by working with over 680 disengaged or excluded young people each year across Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow, many of whom face issues such as low self-esteem, poor social and life skills, mental health issues or drug and alcohol addictions; recognises that Fairbridge offers individuals a fresh start, someone to believe in them and a chance to develop the skills and confidence that they need to change their own lives, and considers that ongoing investment in early intervention and first-step services at a local level is essential to closing the opportunity gap among Scotland&rsquo;s young people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3496</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Keeping Services Local at the Vale of Leven Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the recommendations being presented to a meeting of the board of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that, if accepted, will result in the removal of the 24/7 anaesthetics service and consequent transfer of coronary care and treatment for strokes, gastrointestinal bleeds and epileptic seizures from the Vale of Leven Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; further regrets the recommendation to close the Christie Ward, which provides invaluable inpatient acute mental health services to the local community; strongly considers that the views of the local community will have been totally ignored if these recommendations are approved by the board; further considers that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has failed to integrate health services properly in this area; believes that as many inpatient services as possible should be delivered at the Vale of Leven Hospital but considers that insufficient attention has been given to a reconfiguration of services north of the river based on a revised catchment area and including access to the Golden Jubilee National Hospital; further notes that the recommendations to the board are not keeping services local, as promised by the Scottish Government, and therefore calls on the board of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to reject these proposals, to retain 24/7 anaesthetics and the Christie Ward at the Vale of Leven Hospital and to reconfigure services to be delivered north of the river.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3494</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Not a Penny More</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the cost of the Edinburgh trams project to be &pound;545 million, of which &pound;500 million is to be provided by the Scottish Government; considers that this sum is enough to complete the project, as previously agreed by the contractor; totally rejects any demands for additional funding, which would impact on projects elsewhere, and believes that not a single extra penny should be forthcoming.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3492</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>European Resolution on Depleted Uranium Weapons</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the European Parliament&rsquo;s resolution on &quot;Depleted uranium weapons and their effect on human health and the environment - towards a global ban on the use of such weapons&quot;; recognises the serious health concerns about the use of depleted uranium weapons on both military personnel and civilians, concerns that are widely acknowledged by many including the UN General Assembly; further recognises the serious environmental hazards posed by depleted uranium such as the contamination of soil and groundwater, and strongly urges the Scottish Government to offer its moral and, where appropriate, practical support for a global ban on the use of depleted uranium weapons.</p>
