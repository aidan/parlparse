            Scotland and all those working to raise awareness about the condition 
            of epilepsy; notes the unacceptably high incidence of misdiagnosis 
            and the extreme regional variations in waiting times to see an epilepsy 
            specialist; believes that National Epilepsy Week, 20 – 26 May 2001, 
            brings the opportunity to focus on the need to work together on this 
            issue at local, regional and national levels and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to work with health boards to ensure that a person who has 
            a seizure is referred to a specialist within four weeks, irrespective 
            of the area in which they live.</font></p>

            believes that class size is only one aspect of educational provision 
            which may help to improve standards in Scotland’s schools, and considers 
            that greater devolution of decision making to teachers and parents 
            should be the goal of the Scottish Executive.</a></font></p>
