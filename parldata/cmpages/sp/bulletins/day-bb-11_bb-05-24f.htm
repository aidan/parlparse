<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;<br />
        <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; <br />
        <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; <br />
        <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; <br />
        <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. <br />
  </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any questions in relation to this section should be directed to the Chamber Desk, for which contact details are provided at the <a href="bb-05-24j.htm#end">end of the Bulletin</a>.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00091 Alex Salmond: Law Officers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that it be recommended to Her Majesty that Frank Mulholland QC be appointed as the Lord Advocate and that Lesley Thomson be appointed as Solicitor General for Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00090 Alex Salmond: Junior Scottish Ministers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Michael Matheson, Aileen Campbell, Dr Alasdair Allan, Brian Adam and Stewart Stevenson be appointed as junior Scottish ministers.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00089 Alex Salmond: Scottish Ministers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Alex Neil and Bruce Crawford be appointed as Scottish ministers.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00088 Drew Smith: Southside Festival 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament marks the occasion of the 4th annual Southside Festival, which takes place on 28 May 2011 in the Queen&rsquo;s Park Recreation Ground in Glasgow; notes that last year&rsquo;s festival attracted 15,000 visitors and that this year&rsquo;s event features a wealth of opportunities for Southsiders to enjoy music, art, comedy, talks and other events including community stalls over the period of the festival; further notes that the Southside Film Festival took place between 13 and 15 May; congratulates the organisers, stewards and other volunteers, and sends best wishes for the success of this year&rsquo;s festival, which it hopes will be repeated for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00087# Liam McArthur: Damaging Impact of Air Discount Scheme Changes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the benefits that the Air Discount Scheme has brought to Scotland&rsquo;s island communities since it was first introduced in 2006; considers that, even with the Air Discount Scheme reduction, the cost of flying to and from the islands imposes a considerable financial burden on island life; understands, therefore, the very real concerns that the exclusion of business travel from the Air Discount Scheme has caused to businesses as well as to the public and voluntary sectors in the islands; considers that the change, on which there was no prior consultation, means that businesses and other organisations now either have to face even higher travel costs or have to miss out on opportunities to take part in meetings and other events on the Scottish mainland and further afield, and would welcome an urgent review of the impact of the exclusion of business travel.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00086 Bob Doris: Glee Meets Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow&rsquo;s North United Communities Theatre Group on what is considered its hugely successful first major drama production based on music from the musical drama TV series, Glee, on 20 and 21 May 2011 in the Wyndford Hub; notes that the show is being co-produced by Depot Arts and performed by young people from communities across the north of Glasgow including Ruchill, Cadder, Wyndford and Possilpark; thanks everyone involved in the production, particularly the youngsters who demonstrated such commitment to the show by their excellent performances, by designing and building stage sets, and managing the show&rsquo;s sound and lighting, and believes that such initiatives help to break down long-standing territorial boundaries and bring communities closer together.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00084 Neil Bibby: Gryffe High Goes Fairtrade</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament extends its warmest congratulations to the staff, students and parents of Gryffe High School on being officially recognised as a Fairtrade School; applauds the work done by all at Gryffe High School to promote ethical trading and thereby support some of the world&rsquo;s poorest farmers, and believes that this is an important step on the road to achieving fairtrade status for even more communities across Renfrewshire, where it considers that fairtrade groups have done outstanding work to promote ethical trading throughout Renfrewshire.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00083 Stuart McMillan: Cuts to Welfare Spending </strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern plans by the UK Government to cut &pound;9 billion from the benefits budget over the Comprehensive Spending Review period, including over &pound;2 billion from Disability Living Allowance and over &pound;1 billion from Employment and Support Allowance; considers that these cuts will have a direct affect on many disabled people in Scotland, potentially depriving tens of thousands of vital financial support to meet the extra costs that they face and to support them as they prepare for work; acknowledges the views of RNIB Scotland that this will disproportionately affect the chances of disabled people, including people with sight loss, to lead independent lives, and therefore urges the UK Government to review the savings to be delivered by measures contained in the Welfare Reform Bill and maintain essential support for blind, partially-sighted and other disabled people.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00082 Kenneth Gibson: No Necessity for a Coal-fired Power Station at Hunterston</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Draft Electricity Generation Policy Statement 2010, which made it clear that the Scottish Government is &quot;committed to decarbonising electricity generation by 2030&quot;; acknowledges that the SNP manifesto stated that &quot;the policy statement also makes clear that increased renewable generation means we see no energy need for additional thermal generation plants&quot;; considers that the current proposal for a coal-fired power station at Hunterston is, in effect, for new coal generation and would destroy a valuable site of special scientific interest and impact adversely on the local environment, tourism and the local quality of life; notes the opposition from local communities, thousands of individuals and a broad range of environment and development organisations to the application; expresses concern that the UK Government has submitted Hunterston for New Entrants Reserve 300 funding to the European Investment Bank despite a majority of MSPs in the last session opposing the proposal, and believes that proposals put forward that do not create additional greenhouse gas emissions are more deserving of funding.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Rob Gibson*, Graeme Dey*, Willie Coffey*, Patrick Harvie*</p>
<p><strong>S4M-00082.1 Liam McArthur: No Necessity for a Coal-fired Power Station at Hunterston</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00082 in the name of Kenneth Gibson (No Necessity for a Coal-fired Power Station at Hunterston), leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that approval for the project is the responsibility of the Scottish Government under Scotland&rsquo;s planning powers; believes, therefore, that the UK Government was right to submit all the bids that it received for New Entrants Reserve 300 funding to the European Investment Bank rather than making a unilateral decision on Scottish bids on behalf of the new Scottish administration, and trusts that, in light of the SNP&rsquo;s 2011 manifesto, planning permission for a new coal-fired power station at Hunterston will not be granted.&quot;</p>
<p> <strong>*S4M-00081 John Mason: Full Steam ahead on the New Glasgow to Edinburgh Rail Link</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recently increased service on the Helensburgh to Edinburgh rail line via Glasgow, Airdrie and Bathgate, which serves many towns in central Scotland, and welcomes the continued development of this service, which it considers to be proof of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to transport and, in particular, public transport projects.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00081.1 Jackie Baillie: Full Steam ahead on the New Glasgow to Edinburgh Rail Link</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00081 in the name of John Mason (Full Steam ahead on the New Glasgow to Edinburgh Rail Link), insert at end &quot;and congratulates Network Rail for delivering the project on time and on budget and the last Labour-led Scottish administration for bringing forward the legislation and resources to make this new railway line a reality.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: John Pentland*, Patricia Ferguson*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00080 Liz Smith: ASDA Kwik Cricket Competition Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the 2011 ASDA Kwik Cricket competition for primary schools; considers kwik cricket to be a great way to get children active and to introduce them to one of Scotland&rsquo;s fastest growing sports; recognises that 5,000 children participated in the competition last year and hopes that that number will grow in 2011; notes that the Scotland final takes place at Perth&rsquo;s Doo&rsquo;cot Park on 14 June and that the winners will represent Scotland at the UK final at Derbyshire County Cricket Club on 20 July, and commends the continued support of ASDA and Cricket Scotland in developing the game across the country.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00077 Sandra White: Byres Road, The Great Street</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those who have contributed to the success of Byres Road in Glasgow&rsquo;s west end, which has been shortlisted as a finalist in the greatest street in Britain awards; notes that the nomination is based on the street&rsquo;s environmental credentials, transport links, commercial success and user-friendliness; believes that the street&rsquo;s cosmopolitan atmosphere and eclectic mix of small shops is a great example of how urban areas can flourish; considers that small businesses are the lifeblood of this success, and hopes that the Scottish Government will continue and expand support for small businesses to ensure that they continue to be at the heart of Scotland&rsquo;s cities.</p>
