    Parliament recognises the particular problems experienced by people who suffer from
    macular disease; notes the progress made in the implementation of the recommendation of

    should have to sleep rough by the end of this session of the Parliament; notes that this
    commitment has been moved back from an original deadline of 2002, and believes that the

    essential to ensure that the commitments of the Executive are achieved, that these
    proposals must include provision for support to rough sleepers to enable them to obtain,
    and in turn to maintain, short and medium term tenancies with a view to enabling them to
    return to mainstream housing in the shortest possible time, and that such support should
    ensure that the needs of homeless people with drug, alcohol or mental health problems are
    met.&quot;</p>
