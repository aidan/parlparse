          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>

          <p align="center"> New and altered motions and amendments </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2835 Rosie Kane: EU Mercury Ban</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the attempts of the Westminster Government to seek a delay in the fixing of a date for the EU mercury export ban; recognises that over 12,000 tonnes of mercury from EU mercury cell chlor-alkali plants are expected to be dumped on developing countries over the next 10 to 15 years; acknowledges that mercury can travel long distances through the atmosphere, contaminating both local and global food supplies at levels posing a significant risk to human health; accepts that between 2001 and 2003 the United Kingdom, with Spain, exported over 470 tonnes of mercury to India; acknowledges that between three and 15 million Europeans are near to the international limit for mercury exposure and many are already exposed to unacceptable levels of methylmercury in the Arctic and Mediterranean fishing communities, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on the UK Government to pledge full British support for an immediate ban on the export of mercury and to further pledge to give financial assistance to developing countries that have borne the brunt of this environmental injustice.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2834 Frances Curran: Solidarity with the Erskine Bridge Toll Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Erskine Bridge Toll workers, who are members of the Transport and General Workers Union, on their decision to take official industrial action on Friday 20 May and Saturday 21 May 2005 to prevent the further deterioration of their working conditions and for a &pound;5.50 per hour pay claim; views their pay claim as modest in relation to their employers&rsquo;, APCOA Parking (UK) Ltd, &pound;601,361 income directly from the Scottish Executive merely for collecting tolls; condemns the Executive for allowing APCOA to bring in a security firm to staff the toll booths in an attempt to break the strike, and demands that the Executive use its influence on APCOA to settle the workers&rsquo; claim immediately.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2833# Paul Martin: Closure of Clydesdale Bank Branches</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by National Australia Bank to close 60 Clydesdale Bank branches within Scotland over the next 18&nbsp;months; notes that research has demonstrated that the closure of branches triggers an outflow of economic activity and threatens the long-term survival of communities, particularly when a bank is &ldquo;the last bank in town&rdquo;; believes that closures will have a devastating impact on local communities, particularly in poorer areas where alternative banking is not accessible, and will affect the most vulnerable and least able to travel, such as older people, the less able and parents with young children, and considers that the National Australia Bank should reconsider this massive programme, particularly where a closure will leave communities without any local bank.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2832# Linda Fabiani: Welfare and Education at Dungavel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the fact that asylum seeker families with children are detained; notes, however, the inspection report on Dungavel House immigration removal centre by the Chief Inspector of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Prisons for England and Wales; notes the Chief Inspector&rsquo;s extreme concern about children at the centre and her disappointment that &ldquo;no progress had been made in relation to independent assessment of the welfare and developmental needs of the children who were held in Dungavel at the time of this re-inspection&rdquo;, and considers that the Scottish Executive should enter into discussions with the Home Office&rsquo;s Immigration and Nationality Department to &ldquo;ensure that there are independent assessments and reviews of the welfare and educational needs of detained children, and to take note of their findings&rdquo;, as recommended by the Chief Inspector, and to ensure that South Lanarkshire Council is enabled to meet its obligations under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2831 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>
