<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5002</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Glasgow&rsquo;s Community Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Maryhill&rsquo;s Hugh and Margaret Tavendale and Remzije Sherifi on their success in the overall Glasgow Community Champion Awards; notes that the Lord Provost&rsquo;s Community Award was presented to Hugh and Margaret Tavendale in recognition of their hard work over many years to improve local housing and the wider community; further notes that the Public Service Individual Award was presented to Remzije Sherifi for her work through the Maryhill Integration Network, using her own experiences to benefit others by welcoming them to and helping them to become part of the community; further congratulates all the winners of Community Champion Awards, and commends <em>The Evening Times</em> for organising the awards to recognise the hard work and dedication of those who work throughout the year to make Glasgow such a great city.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5001&diams; </strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>HorseWatch Strathclyde, Combating Equine-related Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the essential work of HorseWatch Strathclyde in partnering with Strathclyde Police to ensure protection against the theft of horses and related property in the local area and to provide vital support services and information to victims of such crime while also laying out preventative measures to ensure that horse owners are not targeted in the first place; commends the initiative, run entirely by volunteers and which, where possible, charges no fees for its services, and hopes that police forces from across Scotland will learn from and adopt similar partnering schemes to enable the effective combating of equine-related crime.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5000</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Plains Needs a Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recently stated commitment of the Airdrie Local Area Partnership that it remains fully supportive of a railway station at Plains; recognises that this commitment is across all political parties within North Lanarkshire Council; further recognises the benefits that such a station would provide to the people of Plains, which is an area that suffers from relatively high levels of deprivation and has low levels of car ownership, and calls on the Scottish Executive to re-examine the case for this station as a matter of urgency so that the people of Plains can benefit from the improved access to educational, employment and recreational opportunities that the Airdrie to Bathgate rail line will provide.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4999</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Friends of Cumbernauld Community Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Friends of Cumbernauld Community Park for winning the Community Environmental Project award at the North Lanarkshire Council environmental awards dinner on Thursday 1 October 2009; notes that this great achievement was made possible through the National Lottery&rsquo;s Breathing Spaces grant programme and notes the worthwhile charitable work carried out by the National Lottery across Scotland; praises the commitment and enthusiasm of the group that worked tirelessly to achieve this success, and finally thanks the North Lanarkshire Council staff who assisted the Friends of Cumbernauld Community Park to achieve this feat.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4998</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Post Office Network</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the statement from the Prime Minister that he wants the Post Office &quot;to play a much bigger role, bringing banking services back to the heart of people&rsquo;s communities&quot;; agrees that the creation of a post bank would build on the strong foundations of the Post Office; recognises that the Post Office has popular confidence and trust, and looks forward to early action to establish a community post bank that would revive and protect the Post Office network.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4990</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Gordon Brown Is Congratulated by Bono in New York</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is immensely proud of and congratulates Gordon Brown for the honour that he was awarded in the United States last week when he was in New York for the UN General Assembly and was hailed as a hero for stabilising the world economy and showing compassionate leadership; notes that he was named World Statesman of the Year at a VIP-packed gala dinner and that the award was presented on behalf of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an interfaith organisation that campaigns for religious freedom and human rights, by the veteran former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who praised Gordon Brown for his vision and dedication in handling the world economic crisis and said, &quot;his leadership has been essential to our ability to overcome the moment of danger&quot;; notes the praise that he received from the foundation, which stated that the award was for his &quot;compassionate leadership in dealing with the challenging issues facing humanity, his commitment to freedom, human dignity and the environment, and for the major role he has played in helping to stabilise the world&rsquo;s financial system&quot;, and finally notes Barak Obama&rsquo;s praise for Gordon&rsquo;s integrity as the two men vowed to work together to tackle the unprecedented global recession.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4990.1</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Gordon Brown Is Congratulated by Bono in New York</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4990) in the name of Helen Eadie, leave out from &quot;is immensely proud&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that Gordon Brown was presented with an award by former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, while in New York; recalls the record of Henry Kissinger while part of the US administration and accusations of his involvement in supporting Operation Condor, a programme of political repression involving assassination across Latin America, as well as in the undermining of the democratically elected Chilean administration of Salvador Allende, which was overthrown on 11 September 1973, heralding the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a period that resulted in the deaths and disappearances of at least 3,000 people; considers that Henry Kissinger&rsquo;s attitude to democracy is characterised by his reported remarks, &quot;I don&rsquo;t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people. The issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves&quot;; recalls that Henry Kissinger was also involved in perpetuating the Vietnam War while part of the US Government, including the secret bombing of Cambodia as part of Operation Menu, resulting in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths; also considers that Henry Kissinger advocated that the US Government turn a blind eye to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, an event of which he allegedly had prior knowledge, and believes that, given this track record, being presented an award by Henry Kissinger is a highly dubious honour indeed.</p>
