            <strong>Henry McLeish: Official Information and Accountability to Parliament 
            - The Executive's Policy</strong>—That the Parliament notes that the Executive 
            is committed to a policy of openness, accessibility and accountability 
            in all its dealings with the Parliament and its Committees; further 
            notes both the Parliament’s right and duty to hold the Executive to 
            account including the power to invoke section 23 of the Scotland Act 
            and the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of exchanges 
            between officials and Ministers concerning policy advice; observes 
            that other Parliaments with strong freedom of information regimes 
            do not disclose the terms of such exchanges; calls, to that end, for 
            the Executive and the Parliament to observe the following principles:</font></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">(i) consistent with its policy of openness, the 
            Executive should always seek to make as much information as possible 
            publicly available as a matter of course and should respond positively 
            to requests for information from the Parliament and its Committees;</font></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">(ii) officials are accountable to Ministers and 
            Ministers in turn are accountable to the Parliament and it follows 
            that, while officials can provide Committees with factual information, 
            Committees should look to Ministers to account for the policy decisions 
            they have taken;</font></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">(iii) where, exceptionally, Committees find it 
            necessary to scrutinise exchanges between officials and Ministers 
            on policy issues, arrangements should be made to ensure that the confidentiality 
            of these exchanges is respected,</font></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">and commends these principles to Committees as 
            guidelines to be followed in their dealings with the Executive.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong><a name="1298"></a>*S1M-1298</strong> <strong>Henry 
            McLeish: Junior Scottish Ministers</strong>—That the Parliament agrees 
            that Malcolm Chisholm, Margaret Curran, Tavish Scott and Allan Wilson 
            be appointed as junior Scottish Ministers.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong><a name="1297"></a>*S1M-1297</strong> <strong>Henry McLeish: 
            Ministers</strong>—That the Parliament agrees that Jackie Baillie and Angus 
            MacKay be appointed as Ministers.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong><a name="1296"></a>*S1M-1296</strong> <strong>Alasdair 
            Morgan: The Brenda Jane Fund - portable ultra-sound scanner appeal</strong>—That 
            the Parliament notes the tragic death of Brenda-Jane Armstrong of 
            Twynholm, Kirkcudbrightshire, who was stillborn at Cresswell Maternity 
            Hospital, Dumfries on 14 September 2000; further notes that in rural 
            Scotland expectant mothers often have to travel considerable distances 
            to get quality ultra-sound scans, and gives its full backing to the 
            appeal fund, &quot;The Brenda Jane Fund&quot;, set up in her memory 
            by her parents Brendan Armstrong and Jane McSkirmming, to raise the 
            £15,000 required to purchase a portable ultrasound scanner for use 
            in rural Kirkcudbrightshire.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1295</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: British Summer 
            Time</strong>—That the Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
            oppose plans to use British Summer Time throughout the year.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1294</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Loud Tie Day</strong>—That 
            the Parliament congratulates and supports the organisers of ‘Loud 
            Tie Day’, which is to be held on Friday 3 November 2000, in their 
            bid to raise awareness of bowel cancer.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1293</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Recognition 
            of Jimmy Logan</strong>—That the Parliament urges that Mr Jimmy Logan, 
            citizen of Glasgow and of the world, be given a knighthood in recognition 
            of his unique services to Scottish culture on stage and on screen; 
            recognises that Mr Logan and the Short family have been outstanding 
            for over 60 years in their utter dedication to Scotland; firmly recognises 
            that Mr Logan personally encapsulates the expression &quot;blessed 
            be the laughter makers&quot; and that he has brought joy into the 
            lives of millions in his performances and is much loved by the people 
            of Scotland whom he has served boundlessly as an entertainer for six 
            decades and also as a hands-on hard worker for charity; notes that 
            his courage in daunting circumstances many times in his life has been 
            an inspiration to generations, and believes that Mr Logan and his 
            family deserve proper recognition, albeit that the proposer of this 
            motion and others do not uphold the way the present honours system 
            is run.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1292</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Lack of 
            Fisheries Minister in the Scottish Executive</strong>—That the Parliament 
            notes that the new Scottish Executive has no dedicated Fisheries Minister 
            and condemns the First Minister’s insult to Scotland’s fishing communities 
            by deciding to downgrade the importance of one of Scotland’s oldest 
            and most vital industries; further notes that prior to devolution, 
            even under the old Scottish Office regime, there was always a dedicated 
            Fisheries Minister, and finally notes that Henry McLeish, in his former 
            role as Scottish Office Minister for Devolution, steered through the 
            Scotland Act which enabled the transfer of thousands of square miles 
            of our fishing waters from Scottish to English jurisdiction and is 
            therefore no friend of Scotland’s fishing communities.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1291</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Downgrading 
            of Scottish News Bulletins</strong>—That the Parliament recognises the 
            importance of regional broadcasting and the need for regional news 
            bulletins that contain Scottish news to keep viewers informed of what 
            is happening in their local area and elsewhere in Scotland; condemns 
            the decision to keep the nightly ITV regional news bulletins at 11.20pm 
            when the main news bulletin edited in London returns to its traditional 
            10pm slot, and calls upon the Independent Television Commission to 
            insist that regional bulletins should follow directly after the main 
            bulletin to allow Scottish viewers to keep abreast of events in their 
            own country.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1290</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Gas Safety 
            Recommendations</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes the review of gas 
            safety undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE); supports 
            the recommendations that (a) it should be compulsory for carbon monoxide 
            detectors to be fitted in all homes, (b) landlords be required to 
            maintain gas appliances in a safe condition and (c) the rules on dealing 
            with emergencies be tightened, including setting legally binding time 
            limits for call outs by gas suppliers who should face prosecution 
            if these are breached, and, in the light of the recent fatal tragedy 
            in Dundee caused by a gas explosion, believes that Her Majesty’s Government 
            should implement the HSE recommendations as a matter of priority.</font></p>
