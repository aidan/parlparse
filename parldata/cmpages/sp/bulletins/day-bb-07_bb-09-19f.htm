          <p><strong>*S3M-499</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Managing the Risk of Flooding in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that a Flooding Bill will be introduced during this parliamentary session; acknowledges the need for Scotland to take a more sustainable approach to flood risk management in order to tackle the increased risk of flooding associated with issues such as climate change; recognises the importance of the publication of the final report of the Flooding Issues Advisory Committee, which ran for two years, and considers that similar positive engagement with stakeholders, including those who have suffered the effects of flooding, should continue throughout the development of the draft Flooding Bill.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S3M-498</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Penal Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that Scotland should develop a progressive penal policy which improves public safety, delivers appropriate and proportionate punishment, ensures that the interests of victims and communities are given proper consideration, contributes to reducing reoffending and encourages rehabilitation in order to build a safer and stronger Scotland; recognises that, in the case of some offenders, custody is the only appropriate disposal, and welcomes the proposal to establish an independent commission to consider the purpose and use of prison.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S3M-497</strong> <strong>Keith Brown on behalf of the Procedures Committee:</strong> <strong>Merging the Procedures Committee and the Standards and Public Appointments Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Procedures Committee&rsquo;s 1st Report, 2007 (Session 3), <em>Merging the Procedures Committee and the Standards and Public Appointments Committee </em>(SP Paper 7), and agrees that the changes to Standing Orders set out in Annexe A to the report be made with effect from 28 September 2007.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Cathie Craigie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S3M-496</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Access to Scottish Executive Initiatives for Those with Low Incidence Disabilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament shares Deafblind Scotland&rsquo;s concerns that access to Scottish Executive initiatives is currently compromised for those with low incidence disabilities such as deafblindness through the growing emphasis on and move to community planning; believes that national organisations are a vital support to those with low incidence disabilities, as the low numbers involved by definition make localised assistance difficult, and asks the Executive to consider an alternative to disbursing all funds for Choose Life and other initiatives, such as those for quality of life and numeracy and literacy, to local authorities only as this inhibits access to central funding for national organisations supporting those with low incidence disabilities across Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-495</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Support for the College of Piping in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the continuing good work of the College of Piping in Otago Street in Glasgow which, since 1944, has propagated the development and spread of the national instrument of Scotland within this country and across the world; notes that without its influence piping tuition in schools leading to higher exams and university degrees would not have been established; further notes that it has been instrumental in the establishment of the Professional Pipers Association, the Institute of Piping, the College of Piping in Canada and the Piping Centre in Glasgow, and requests that the Scottish Government looks at the provision of support for the development programme of the College of Piping which is presently ongoing.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-494</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Property Management Accreditation Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent report from the Scottish Consumer Council (SCC) entitled <em>Consumer Experiences of Property Management Services: A Case Study</em>; acknowledges that, while the SCC survey detailed in the report was not comprehensive, it nevertheless suggested that there are serious shortcomings in the way that some properties are managed and in the knowledge of consumers about the duties of property managers, and accordingly agrees with the SCC that the development of a national accreditation scheme for property managers should be expedited by the Scottish Government.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-493</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-492</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Action Against Human Trafficking</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Amnesty International campaign against all forms of human trafficking in the United Kingdom; recognises that victims of trafficking often exhibit the symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome, depression and anxiety, as well as evidence of physical harm; recognises that we now have a duty of care to all victims of trafficking regardless of nationality, and calls on the Scottish Government to show leadership in the implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings by implementing the provisions of the convention for which it has devolved responsibility to the highest standard and co-ordinating the great work that is already being undertaken by local authorities, police forces, non-governmental organisations and voluntary organisations to promote best practice, standardise levels of care and ensure consistency across Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-491</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Adam Smith College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Adam Smith College on its excellent HM Inspectorate of Education report, published on 7 September 2007; notes that the report commends Adam Smith College for its sector-leading and innovative practice&nbsp;in nine&nbsp;service areas, a figure only achieved by a handful of colleges in the past, for its good knowledge of social and economic factors in Fife, for its committed and enthusiastic staff, placing a high importance on the effectiveness of the learning and teaching process, and considers that the report is a great testament to Adam Smith College staff, Dr Craig Thomson and his management team who have contributed to the further enhancement of an already excellent learning experience and increased substantially social mobility and the growth of the local and Scottish economy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-490</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant:</strong> <strong>Call for First Minister to Apologise to the Scottish Crofting Foundation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the First Minister should apologise to the Scottish Crofting Foundation for excluding it from the summit held on 13 September 2007 on safeguarding a sustainable food supply for Scotland; further expresses surprise that the Scottish Crofting Foundation was not told officially that the summit had been arranged and, despite contacting the Scottish Government, was still not invited to attend; believes that crofting plays a vitally important role in the food industry, given that crofters from all over the highlands and islands supply thousands of store sheep, lambs and calves annually as well as providing lambs for direct export to continental Europe, and considers that the Scottish Government should invite the Scottish Crofting Foundation to any future meetings relating to the food industry in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-489</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Valuable Assets - A Report into the Role and Status of Classroom Assistants in Scottish Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Equal Opportunities Commission on the publication of its report, <em>Valuable Assets, </em>on the role and status of classroom assistants and believes that the report illustrates many of the vital roles that those employed as classroom assistants perform, that classroom assistants are now a vital part of the education system in Scotland&rsquo;s schools, that their role should be formally recognised in any plans and policies relating to school education and that the recommendations of the report in relation to classroom assistants should be included in any such plans.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-429</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>QE2</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the visit of the QE2 to the River Clyde on 20 September 2007; further notes that the QE2 was built by John Brown&rsquo;s shipyard in Clydebank 40 years ago; welcomes the invitation extended by Cunard to the men who built the vessel to board the ship one last time; notes with concern that many of those who built the QE2 are no longer alive, due to asbestos-related diseases resulting from less secure work and safety practices in the shipbuilding industry at that time, and calls on Cunard to consider a more generous gesture to the surviving men and the families of men who are no longer alive.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-429.1</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>QE2</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-429) in the name of Stuart McMillan, after &quot;at that time&quot; insert &quot;recognises that people who formerly worked on the QE2 are prominent in the Clydebank Asbestos Group which has successfully campaigned on issues such as securing prescription of Alimta on the NHS and ensuring the amendment of the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976; furthermore recognises that there are many work-related health issues still to be addressed&quot;.</p>
