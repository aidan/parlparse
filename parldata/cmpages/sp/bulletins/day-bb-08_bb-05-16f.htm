<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1930</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Midnight League Football Team, Woodmill Rovers of Dunfermline</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Midnight League football team Woodmill Rovers, of Dunfermline, on winning the finals of the over-14s East of Scotland Midnight League at Tynecastle Stadium on 14 May 2008; welcomes the investment of the main sponsor, Bank of Scotland, in supporting the league; notes the success of the Midnight League 5-a-side community football programme throughout Scotland; commends everyone involved in supporting and organising the league, and wishes Woodmill Rovers every success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1929</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Fife Council for Top Performance in National Assessment of Cycling Provision</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Fife Council for coming top in performance for the second year in the National Assessment of Cycling Provision; notes that Fife retains the title for the best performing council in Scotland, scoring an impressive 71% against the required strategy; further notes that Fife Council was also commended for being highly prioritised in budgeting and strategy development and that the kingdom&rsquo;s cycle network accommodates a wide variety of user needs, and acknowledges the high-quality work undertaken throughout Fife in promoting cycling as part of a comprehensive package of sustainable travel measures and as a healthy lifestyle activity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1928</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Train to Gain</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the plans, announced by the Prime Minister on 14 May 2008, to give employees in England the legal right to request time to train from their employers; believes that such moves are necessary to increase the number of people who can gain more skills, become more productive and develop more fulfilling careers; further notes that consultation will be undertaken by the UK Government on how workers can be legally empowered to make such requests to undertake training and that the arrangements for employers would be modelled on the existing right to request flexible working; considers that such moves will increase employer and employee awareness of the training and funds available, including the Train to Gain service which helps businesses identify and address skills needs and is further supported by the UK Government funding rising to over &pound;1 billion per year by 2010-11, and hopes that the Scottish Government will bring forward similarly progressive proposals that will benefit both employees and employers, help develop a skilled workforce for Scotland and provide a boost to the Scottish economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1927</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Johnnie Walker Still Going Strong</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its congratulations to Diageo and all those involved with Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky in Kilmarnock for the brand&rsquo;s continuing success in the Power 100 ranking of the world&rsquo;s wines and spirits for 2008; notes that Johnnie Walker Red Label is still going strong as the world&rsquo;s number one whisky; recognises the importance of this brand to the economy of Kilmarnock and Loudoun, and acknowledges that Scotland&rsquo;s position as the country with the most powerful brand identity in the drinks industry offers Scotland a sustainable competitive advantage that should be supported by all those concerned with Scotland&rsquo;s economic performance.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1926#</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Success of First Year of Co-Operative Development Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of Co-operative Development Scotland in promoting and facilitating the development of co-operative enterprises across Scotland since it became fully operational in April 2007; notes that research carried out by Heriot-Watt University in 2006 estimated the combined annual turnover of co-operatives and mutuals in Scotland to be around &pound;4 billion; believes that the contribution of this sector to the Scottish economy nationally and to local urban and rural economies, such as that of Dumfries and Galloway, could be increased, and believes that government funding for Co-operative Development Scotland should be extended beyond March 2009.</p>
