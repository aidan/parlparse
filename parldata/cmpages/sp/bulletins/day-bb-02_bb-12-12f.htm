            Development Committee on 10 December 2002 and therefore regrets the 
            exclusion from the boundaries of the Cairngorms National Park of those 
            areas of Highland Perthshire and Drumochter, including the forest 
            of Atholl, Beinn a &#145;Ghlo and Blair Atholl, all of which were

            Natural Heritage in its report, prepared for the Scottish Executive, 
            on the proposal for a National Park in the Cairngorms, and is concerned 
            that, if these areas remain excluded, the attainment by the park of 
            World Heritage Status may be put in jeopardy, and further regrets 
            that the Order does not include the Gaelic translation of Cairngorms

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3700.1</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor: Fisheries 
            2003</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3700) in the name 
            of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;recognises the importance of sustainable fisheries for the well-being 
            of the Scottish fishing industry and fishing communities and therefore 
            strongly rejects any advice that would close Scotland&#146;s mixed 
            fishery; believes that more time is required to assess truly the current 
            state of fish stocks and the effects of the conservation measures 
            already taken by Scottish fishermen; believes that elected MEPs should 
            have the opportunity to debate and vote on any new quota cuts before 
            they are implemented; urges fisheries ministers Ross Finnie and Elliot 
            Morley to ensure that they do not preside over the decimation of Scotland&#146;s 
            fishing industry but instead achieve an outcome that is fair and equitable 
            to Scottish fishermen, and ultimately believes that the Common Fisheries 
            Policy of collective management has failed and therefore should be 
            scrapped and replaced by national and local control and management 
            of European waters as the only way to ensure future sustainability 
            of fish stocks and thus the fishing industry.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3700.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Fisheries 
            2003</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3700) in the name 
            of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;urges the Scottish Executive to officially lead the UK delegation 
            at next week&#146;s Fisheries Council with a view to opposing vigorously 
            any draconian cuts in fishing opportunities; calls on the Executive 
            to propose that viable quotas be set that will allow the fleet to 
            return to sea in the new year, providing the opportunity for states 
            with a direct interest in the North Sea and the Irish Sea to bring 
            forward management plans later in 2003 that promote fisheries conservation 
            and secure a future for our fisheries communities, and further calls 
            on the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to engage directly 
            with other EU states and Norway to achieve this objective.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3698.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Children's and 
            Young People's Services in Scotland</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
            to motion (S1M-3698) in the name of Irene McGugan, leave out from 
            &quot;in particular&quot; to end and insert &quot;the concern expressed 
            within reports about the pressures facing children&#146;s hearings 
            and the inadequate nature of the resources and disposals available; 
            acknowledges that the problems of youth disorder must be given high 
            priority if the right to peace and security at home and in the community 
            is to be protected; calls upon the Scottish Executive to introduce 
            an increased range of disposals for children&#146;s hearings, including 
            weekend and evening detention, restriction of liberty orders and expansion 
            of supervised attendance orders and community service orders along 
            with an increase in secure accommodation and a substantial increase 
            in police officers visible in our communities, and recognises that, 
            while much material poverty has been alleviated, 21st century forms 
            of vulnerability require policies that create wealth and provide economic 
            opportunity and security for all, which can only happen within a framework 
            of public order in which people have the security of strong families, 
            communities and high quality public services.&quot; </p>

            recommendation of the recent reports into children&#146;s services, 
            the Child Protection Review, <em>It&#146;s Everyone&#146;s Job to make 
            Sure I&#146;m Alright</em>, the Audit Scotland report, <em>Dealing with 
            Offending by Young People</em> and the Scottish Committee of the Council 
            on Tribunals&#146; report into Children&#146;s Hearings; notes the 
            need to address recruitment and retention of social workers and welcomes 
            progress in the Executive&#146;s Action Plan for Social Services; 
            notes that the reports highlight a need to continue to focus on delivery 
            which improves outcomes for Scotland&#146;s children, and agrees that 
            the Executive should continue to address the problems of poverty and 
            exclusion and close the opportunity gap.&quot; </p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3623.1</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: Glasgow 
            to Barra Air Link Public Service Obligation</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
            to motion (S1M-3623) in the name of Mr Duncan Hamilton, leave out

            of the residents of the Island of Barra about the future of the vital 
            air link between the island and Glasgow; recognises the strength of 
            feeling expressed at a public meeting held on the island on Monday 
            9 December 2002 where the clear view was expressed that any loss of 
            the service would result in damage to the local economy and tourism 
            and create hardship for those attending hospital and receiving life-saving 
            treatment in Glasgow and beyond; considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should conduct its review of the air service with urgency and, following 
            this review, put procedures in place to tender the service for an 
            additional two years, and believes that, once this current contract 
            period ends, the Executive should seek to tender the service for a 
            period of three years in the future, bringing it into line with the 
            provision for Campbeltown and Tiree.&quot;</p>
