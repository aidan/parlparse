          <p><strong>*S2M-98#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne: Regulation of Care 
            Home Provision</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that standards 
            are not as required in some residential homes; notes with concern 
            the apparent inconsistent care of the elderly within some care and 
            nursing homes where, despite being charged nearly £400 per week for 
            their care, residents develop malnutrition from not receiving proper 
            meals or are abused at the hands of care workers; considers therefore 
            that the Scottish Executive should ensure that its regulating care 
            commission regularly monitors all care homes, is given more powers 
            to address the incidence of poor care provided in residential homes 
            by tightening their registration and regulation and improving the 
            standards of staff training required, and further considers that appropriate 
            action should be taken against residential home owners who are guilty 
            of mismanagement and unacceptable care. </p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-97</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Education (School 
            Meals) (Scotland) Bill - Financial Resolution</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the Education (School Meals) (Scotland) Bill, agrees 
            to any increase attributable to that Act in expenditure payable out 
            of the Scottish Consolidated Fund by or under any other Act.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-96</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle: European Football 
            Achievements of Scottish Clubs</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            Celtic Football Club on its UEFA Cup achievements this season; welcomes 
            the increase in Scotland's co-efficient as a result of this run, pushing 
            us up the UEFA rankings; congratulates the Celtic fans on the fantastic 
            impression they left in Seville; further congratulates all Scottish 
            teams that qualified for European football next season, and sends 
            best wishes to Rangers and Celtic in the Champions League and Heart 
            of Midlothian and Dundee in the UEFA Cup.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-95</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle: Edinburgh Fringe and 
            International Festival</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges 
            the importance of the role of the Edinburgh Fringe and International 
            Festival in the annual calendar of Scottish tourism and its huge magnetism 
            for the global tourism market; notes the wealth of jobs it gives rise 
            to, both in Edinburgh and throughout Scotland; recognises the difficulties 
            faced by the organisers this year in the wake of the fire in the Cowgate 
            area of the city, both in finding alternative venues and promoting 
            a "business as usual" image to the international market, and urges 
            the Scottish Executive to work with VisitScotland to ensure that the 
            festival organisers have the necessary support and assistance to make 
            this year's festival a success. </p>
          <p><strong>S2M-94</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Charity Law Reform</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that existing charity law is based on a statute 
            that was passed in 1601 and therefore in urgent need of modernisation 
            to reflect today's public perception of a charity; believes that the 
            recommendations arising from the McFadden Commission form the basis 
            of a robust legislative framework fit for the 21st century; recognises 
            public concern about ensuring that charitable donations are used for 
            the core purpose of a charity; welcomes the Scottish Executive's intention 
            to establish the Office of the Scottish Charities Regulator (OSCR) 
            to monitor the activities of charities and ensure transparency; notes 
            that the OSCR will not have full statutory powers to cover all of 
            its functions and that the Scottish Executive will keep under review 
            the need for legislation, but, nevertheless, considers that the urgent 
            need for a comprehensive charities bill is essential to creating a 
            pro-active system of regulation to restore public confidence.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-93#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Promoting Arts Organisations 
            in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the success of 
            the collective enterprise of Edinburgh&#146;s arts organisations in 
            co-operating through The Audience Business to produce accurate statistics 
            for numbers of people attending arts events and working in the arts 
            and to develop a systematic, sustained programme of increasing audience 
            numbers, and considers that the Scottish Executive and the Scottish 
            Arts Council should co-operate with arts organisations and local authorities 
            in promoting similar schemes throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Brian Monteith<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-92</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: Scottish Brass Band 
            Week 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes Scottish Brass 
            Band Week 2003, 24 to 31 May; recognises the importance of brass band 
            playing, with 80 brass bands in communities across Scotland from Lerwick 
            to Loanhead and Arran to Armadale; further recognises brass bands&#146; 
            roots in the mills and collieries of Scotland, and congratulates the 
            Scottish Brass Band Association for its promotion of this important 
            cultural tradition.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Margaret Jamieson, Mr John Home Robertson, Mr Kenneth 
            Macintosh, Irene Oldfather, Maureen Macmillan, Mr Duncan McNeil, Des 
            McNulty, Jackie Baillie, Dr Sylvia Jackson, Marlyn Glen, Cathie Craigie,

          <p><strong>S2M-91</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle: Electoral Registration 
            and Victims of Domestic Abuse</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            that victims of domestic abuse can become vulnerable to further abuse 
            and intimidation through publication of their names and addresses 
            on the publicly available electoral register; notes the House of Commons 
            Home Affairs Select Committee&#146;s Fourth Report 1997-98, <em>Electoral 
            Law and Administration</em>, which recognised the calls for a means 
            of registering without having to reveal information that could make 
            the elector vulnerable, and calls on the Electoral Commission and 
            the UK Parliament to give consideration to developing a system to 
            allow anonymous electoral registration in exceptional circumstances, 
            while providing safeguards against electoral fraud, as part of the 
            general review of electoral registration.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-90#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Weekend Ban on Scallop 
            Fishing</strong>&#151;That the Parliament opposes the introduction 
            of any technical measures for the scallop fishing industry that would 
            include a weekend ban; believes that such a ban (a), if geographically 
            confined, will cause major displacement problems, (b) will produce 
            no conservation benefit, as those who do not already work a five-day 
            week work two 10-day trips a month, which amounts to the same fishing 
            effort, and (c) will disrupt supplies to processors, who rely on continuity 
            of supply, and thereby will threaten continued access to the lucrative 
            Spanish market, particularly the weekend market for which a premium 
            price is presently enjoyed, and notes that, in contrast to the lack 
            of any contribution of a weekend ban to effective conservation measures, 
            measures that would make a real and significant contribution to conservation 
            have been proposed and developed by the Scallop Association and the 
            Mallaig and North West Fishermans Association, which would enhance 
            conservation whilst allowing the industry to remain viable.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-89#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Rural Rail Services</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that the contract to operate Scotland&#146;s 
            internal rail services over the next seven years is shortly to be 
            awarded; recognises that the provision of affordable, reliable and 
            regular rail services across all of the Scottish network is important 
            to the social and economic well-being of communities, and believes 
            that, in considering the tender proposals offered by the competing 
            train operators, the vital needs of communities served by rural lines 
            should not be forgotten.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-88#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Minch Moor </strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the concerns of local people, hill-walkers and 
            ramblers about the application by AMEC Ltd to locate a wind farm at 
            Minch Moor, near Innerleithen and Walkerburn in the Scottish Borders, 
            an area designated by Scottish Borders Council in its 1995 Structure 
            Plan as a &quot;preferred area of search&quot; for wind farms; further 
            notes that the application concerns the erection of 14 turbines some 
            100 metres high, with at least seven of the turbines being visible 
            from Walkerburn and three being directly adjacent to part of the Southern 
            Upland Way; is aware that, as yet, there is no indication from AMEC 
            Ltd on how and where the power lines will run; shares the local, national 
            and international concern that this unspoiled countryside, including 
            the skyline defined by Priesthope Hill and Windlestraw Law, will be 
            blemished should this development proceed; further shares concerns 
            that tourism in this economically vulnerable area will suffer, and 
            therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should review its 
            planning policy on the proliferation of wind farms and examine planning 
            policy elsewhere in Europe, in particular Germany, Netherlands and 
            Denmark, with the purpose of developing a proactive national planning-led 
            approach to the location of wind farms.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-87#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Relocation of European 
            Maritime Safety Agency to Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that the European Maritime Safety Agency is due to relocate 
            from Brussels to elsewhere in the European Union; further notes the 
            long-standing and rich sea-going heritage and ongoing business interests 
            of both Glasgow and Scotland in the maritime sector, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive, and all relevant bodies, should take 
            all possible steps to have the agency located in Glasgow.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-86#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard: Proposals for the 
            Future of Europe</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the proposals 
            by the Convention on the Future of Europe for an EU constitution and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should conduct a consultative 
            public referendum on such proposals.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-84</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock: Education (School 
            Meals) (Scotland) Bill - Stage 1</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            agrees to the general principles of the Education (School Meals) (Scotland) 
            Bill.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-83</strong> <strong>Colin Fox: Cuban Miami Five</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament expresses concern at the trial and detention in the 
            United States of America of Cuban nationals Antonio Guerrero Rodriguez, 
            Fernando Gonzalez Llort, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo, Ramon Labanino 
            Salazar and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert, known as the Miami Five; considers 
            that the nature of the charges, the location of the trial in Miami, 
            Florida, in an atmosphere of media and public intimidation and the 
            length of the sentences subsequently handed down call into question 
            the safety of the judicial process; notes that the immediate families 
            of the detainees have been unable to visit them as they have been 
            denied entry to the USA, and believes that the US Government should 
            support the petition for a retrial and ensure that it is held in a 
            jurisdiction that guarantees a fair trial.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Bill Butler, Scott Barrie</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-82</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson: Robin Rigg 
            Offshore Wind Farm (Navigation and Fishing) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament agrees that the Robin Rigg Offshore Wind Farm (Navigation 
            and Fishing) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-81#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Planning Law </strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming Planning Bill proposed by 
            the Scottish Executive in the consultation paper <em>Your place, your 
            plan: A White Paper on Public Involvement in Planning</em>; considers 
            that the consultation is of extreme importance in assessing the outstanding 
            needs to improve our planning law; believes that there is a particular 
            need to build in greater fairness for local residents affected by 
            planning decisions and that changes to the law should include a qualified 
            right of appeal against decisions of the planning authority for those 
            directly affected by a planning decision; further believes that there 
            must be improvements in the neighbourhood notification system and 
            a new right for objectors to receive some expert assistance to present 
            their case; believes that, as the relevant elected representatives, 
            MSPs should be directly notified by the Scottish Executive of planning 
            appeals received from within their constituencies, and considers that 
            the Executive should consider fully these changes and ensure that 
            the process of decision making in planning is open and transparent 
            at both local authority and Executive level.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-80</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: MTV Awards</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament appreciates the contribution made by the Scottish contemporary 
            music industry to Scottish arts and culture and, most particularly 
            to, the Scottish economy; notes the broad range of talents and skills 
            within the industry, including songwriters, musicians, educators, 
            producers, technicians, small business record labels, recording studios, 
            broadcasters, agents, promoters and venue and festival organisers; 
            is proud of the diverse range of music courses available throughout 
            Scotland; congratulates Edinburgh on securing the MTV Awards, to be 
            held in Leith later this year, and wishes the best of luck to all 
            Scottish nominees and participants.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-79#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Local Bus Routes 
            </strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses concerns over powers 
            of deregulated bus operators to alter local bus routes without prior 
            consultation and notice to local communities; believes that it is 
            not acceptable that profitability is put before access in such cases; 
            is particularly concerned about the adverse effect of such changes 
            on older people, those with disabilities and parents with young children, 
            restricting their access to vital services and facilities; notes that 
            the negative experience of such changes in communities such as Bromhill, 
            Anderson and Townhead in Glasgow has resulted in community campaigns 
            to reinstate bus services; further notes that there is currently no 
            legal requirement for bus operators to consult members of the public 
            on the variation of bus routes and that bus operators are reluctant 
            to provide advance warning of changes owing to commercial sensitivities; 
            notes that there is no statutory duty for a strategic authority to 
            assess gaps created in bus services, and believes that measures should 
            be considered by the Parliament to create statutory duties on bus 
            operators to consult communities on proposed changes to local bus 
            routes and to ensure that bus operators serve hospitals and key services, 
            regardless of profitability.</p>

            the Parliament welcomes the official visit to the Scottish Parliament 
            by a delegation from the Palestinian Authority from 26 to 28 June 
            2003, organised by the British Council; notes that the Palestinian 
            Authority is the official legislative body of the Palestinian people; 
            recognises that the development of democracy and administrative organisation 
            in the Palestinian Authority can benefit greatly from co-operation 
            of the Scottish Parliament and hopes that this visit will represent 
            only the beginning of a positive and practical relationship with the 
            Palestinian Authority; further recognises the extremely difficult 
            circumstances in which the Palestinian Authority must operate, particularly 
            the on-going occupation by the Israeli Defence Force; aspires to a 
            settled peace in the Middle East for both the Palestinian and Israeli 
            peoples; considers that the Road Map for Peace represents an opportunity 
            to establish an independent Palestinian state within three years; 
            insists that the Road Map for Peace process must be a genuine attempt 
            to meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people, including those 
            currently with no right of return to their homeland, and calls on 
            the Government of Israel to halt the building of illegal settlements 
            and withdraw from the occupied territories immediately.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-75</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin: North Ayrshire Leisure 
            Limited</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns the action of North 
            Ayrshire Leisure Limited, a company formed, and primarily funded, 
            by North Ayrshire Council, in banning the Auchenharvie Ice Dance and 
            Figure Skating Club from operating a small tuck shop selling "20p 
            mixtures" of sweets and non-fizzy drinks, proceeds of which were used 
            to help fund the development of skating and ice dance talent among 
            young people in the north Ayrshire area; notes that this action will 
            mean that the club may now struggle to meet financial obligations 
            to its young members in terms of dance and skating development and 
            recognition of achievement, and deplores the fact that North Ayrshire 
            Leisure Limited appears to be putting profit before sporting development 
            by advising club members that they should instead use vending machines 
            selling over-priced and unhealthy chocolate bars and fizzy drinks.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-74#</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell: Terrestrial Trunked 
            Radio Masts</strong>&#151;That the Parliament considers that there 
            should be a halt to the introduction of terrestrial trunked radio 
            (TETRA) masts throughout Scotland until such time as (a) safety standards 
            specifically relating to TETRA technology are drawn up and (b) TETRA 
            masts and equipment are fully tested against such standards and any 
            adverse health effects identified and made public.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-70#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Maternity Services 
            in Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses support for 
            the unique child and maternal healthcare link at Yorkhill NHS Trust, 
            Glasgow; notes that the Queen Mother's Hospital at Yorkhill currently 
            caters for 3,400 births each year and is expected to take on extra 
            births from other NHS boards; further notes that the Royal Hospital 
            for Sick Children is a national centre of excellence in many fields 
            of paediatric care; is concerned that the review of maternity services, 
            announced by Greater Glasgow NHS Board on 20 May, 2003, may threaten 
            the long-term future of both the Queen Mother&#146;s Hospital and 
            the Royal Hospital for Sick Children; notes the vigorous campaign 
            involving parents, the local community and elected representatives 
            only four years ago against the proposed removal of Yorkhill NHS Trust 
            from its existing site in the west of Glasgow, and believes that the 
            Greater Glasgow NHS Board should consider responses to its previous 
            consultation on the future of Yorkhill NHS Trust and the implications 
            of breaking up the paediatric-maternity care link alongside any new 
            consultation to be organised on the future of maternity services in 
            Glasgow.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-69#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Fair Credit Schemes</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the recently published in-depth report into 
            personal debt in the UK, <em>In Too Deep</em>, produced by the citizens 
            advice bureau (CAB) service in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern 
            Ireland; acknowledges the Scottish context of the report; notes with 
            concern the report's findings that more people in Scotland blamed 
            low incomes than elsewhere in the UK and more people coped with their 
            debt problem by taking out further borrowing than elsewhere in the 
            UK; further notes that personal debt is nearly always connected to 
            other problems in people&#146;s lives such as loss of job or ill-health; 
            notes that the number of debt cases brought to citizens advice bureaux 
            in Scotland is at an all-time high with nearly 60,000 new debt enquiries 
            last year; recognises the link between CAB clients and MSPs&#146; 
            constituents and therefore supports the invaluable work of Scotland&#146;s 
            CAB service as a vital provider of free, independent, impartial and 
            comprehensive advice and as the leading voice on the issue of personal 
            debt in Scotland today; welcomes the commitments in <em>A Partnership 
            for a Better Scotland</em> to support the extension of the money advice 
            service, building on the work of the CAB and other bodies to assist 
            those burdened by multiple debt, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should increase access to affordable credit for people on very low 
            incomes and, as a matter of urgency, take action on the commitment 
            from <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland </em>to work with the 
            Department of Trade and Industry to introduce fairer credit schemes 
            and protection from exorbitant interest rates.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-68</strong> <strong>John Swinburne: Airdrieonians FC</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises that it is time that the great Lanarkshire 
            football club of Airdrieonians FC, which was formed in 1878, has it 
            title returned to its rightful place in the community to supersede 
            the temporary title, Airdrie United; further recognises that had the 
            proud Airdrieonians not been forced into liquidation last season, 
            Falkirk FC would have been relegated and would only now be returning 
            to the First Division, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to intercede on behalf of the Airdrie community and demand the return 
            of the proud title &quot;Airdrieonians FC&quot; from the administrators, 
            KPMG.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-67#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Scottish Premier 
            League's Treatment of Falkirk Football Club</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament condemns the decision of the Scottish Premier League (SPL) 
            to reject the application from Falkirk Football Club, as champions 
            of the Scottish Football League's First Division, to join the SPL, 
            despite the fact that the SPL stadium criteria would be met both by 
            the club's new stadium, under construction at Westfield, and by the 
            Excelsior Stadium at Airdrie, of which Falkirk Football Club would 
            have guaranteed use for all SPL home fixtures for the 2003-04 season, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should make it a condition 
            of any future public funding of SPL members that the criteria for 
            admission to the SPL do not infringe any principles of natural justice 
            and that any application for admission is assessed in an open and 
            accountable manner.</p>

            of Genetically Modified Organisms</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            condemns outright the immoral and unethical actions of the US Government 
            in tying food and assistance for AIDS victims to the acceptance of 
            genetically modified organisms; vigorously opposes the US case at 
            the World Trade Organisation opposing the EU moratorium on genetically 
            modified organisms, and calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government to 
            do the same.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-65.1</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Reduction in Services 
            at Vale of Leven General Hospital</strong>&#151;As an amendment to 
            motion (S2M-65) in the name of Frances Curran, leave out from &quot;elderly&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;services at the Vale of Leven Hospital caused 
            by a combination of the increasing specialisation of staff, particularly 
            in surgery, the inability of Argyll and Clyde NHS Board to attract 
            staff to the area and the demands of Royal College guidelines; further 
            notes the contingency arrangements in place for the provision of maternity 
            services, in partnership with the Queen Mother's Hospital, Glasgow, 
            and for accident and emergency services; welcomes the forthcoming 
            return of maternity services delivered through a midwife-led unit 
            and the prospect of returning full orthopaedic surgery to the Vale 
            of Leven Hospital; recognises the deep concern of local people at 
            the gradual erosion of services and, in particular, at the recent 
            announcement by Argyll and Clyde NHS Board of changes to the accident 
            and emergency service; urges the Scottish Executive to review all 
            the circumstances that led to the decision, and believes that the 
            acute services review, due to be launched in the summer, provides 
            a real opportunity to deliver sustainable and improved healthcare 
            for the future."</p>

            at the Tay Bridgehead in north-east Fife; is aware of widespread local 
            community support in the area for such a school; believes that the 
            school is vital to relieve pressure on Madras College, St Andrews, 
            which is the second largest secondary school in Scotland with a pupil 
            roll of 1,850 and on Bell Baxter High School, Cupar, and further notes 
            that the relocation of an additional squadron to RAF Leuchars will 
            increase the pressure on the existing secondary schools and exacerbate 
            the current situation.</p>
