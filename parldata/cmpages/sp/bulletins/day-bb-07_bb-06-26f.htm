<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-243</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the Government&rsquo;s transport priorities and notes that the Government party proposed during the election campaign not to proceed with the Edinburgh Trams and current EARL projects, but planned an additional crossing for the River Forth.</p>
<p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-242</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Freedom of Information</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report of the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons rejecting the UK Government&rsquo;s proposal to reduce the rights of the citizen under the Freedom of Information Act; notes the committee&rsquo;s view that the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office should be made independent of government and be funded by and accountable to Parliament, and welcomes the fact that the Scottish Information Commissioner and other similar post holders established by this Parliament are independent of the Scottish Executive and are already funded by and accountable to this Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-241</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Land for Affordable Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that house prices have risen by 180% in the last 10 years and as such are increasing the demand for affordable housing; notes that one of the great obstacles to developing affordable housing is obtaining appropriate land for development, particularly in urban areas; congratulates the Scottish Churches Make it Happen campaign which has identified potential for affordable homes from redundant and underused church properties, and calls on the Scottish Executive to enter into negotiations with Scottish Churches and other landholding bodies such as the Ministry of Defence, the NHS and the Forestry Commission to ensure that the necessary land is made available to meet the demand for affordable housing across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-240</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Braw Lads&rsquo; Gathering of Galashiels</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Galashiels&rsquo; Braw Lads&rsquo; Executive on this year&rsquo;s Braw Lads&rsquo; Week and Braw Lads&rsquo; and Braw Lasses&rsquo; Festival; recognises the huge, year-long commitment made by each member in donating their time to raise funds for the week; further congratulates the Braw Lad and Braw Lass on their appointments; notes the significance of the week-long diary of events in terms of marking Galashiels&rsquo; historical past, particularly the dipping of the Burgh Flag which is a poignant mark of respect for those who died in World Wars One and Two, and commends the people of Galashiels on their unfaltering support for this important annual event.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-239</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>End Fuel Poverty by 2016</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that all types of household are susceptible to fuel poverty, but particularly pensioner and lone-parent households; notes Scottish Executive figures published earlier this year showing that 419,000 Scottish households are in fuel poverty; recognises the crucial role that the central heating and Warm Deal programmes have played in delivering thousands of vulnerable individuals out of fuel poverty in the last eight years; however recognises the concern of key stakeholders that more needs to be done to tackle fuel poverty, and calls for urgent action to meet the 2016 target to abolish fuel poverty in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-238</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Paisley Victoria Cross Memorial Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the ceremony to be held on 26 June 2007 in Paisley Abbey, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the first award of the Victoria Cross, to unveil a memorial in honour of the five recipients of this medal who came from Paisley; notes that Paisley is thought to have the highest concentration of Victoria Cross winners of any town in the world; further notes its gratitude for the sacrifices made by these men and their comrades, and sends its respects to the representatives, relatives and regiments of the men and to others who represented the Paisley area with such distinction.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-237</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Rural Fuel Discount Scheme Amendment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the disproportionately high cost of fuel in the remote and rural parts of Scotland where cars are a necessity not a luxury; further notes the undue burden that this puts on the social and economic life of these areas and calls on the Scottish Executive to indicate its support for the &quot;rural fuel discount scheme&quot; amendment to the UK Government&rsquo;s Finance Bill to benefit people in remote areas by allowing fuel duty be cut by up to 2.4 pence per litre, which is in line with EU law and already used in rural France, Portugal and Greece, but not in the UK, and believes that this would make a real difference to people in rural areas who face high fuel costs, greater driving distances and little or no public transport.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-236</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Devolved Fuel Duty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the right held by the French government to vary fuel duty under certain circumstances; notes that this policy could lead to cuts in fuel duty of up to 3% in rural areas; considers this to be a valuable means of alleviating a proportion of the financial burden on rural drivers who often rely on private transport to access essential services, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consult the other devolved legislatures with a view to presenting a case in favour of this policy to the UK Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-235</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>RNID Report, Here to be Heard, on Information for Hearing Aid Users</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the report<em>, Here to be Heard,</em> by Glasgow Caledonian University on behalf of RNID and, in particular, its key findings that only half of hearing aid users believed that they had received enough instruction on how to use their aids before being fitted and that three-quarters felt that this would have been useful; supports the empowerment of well-informed patients who can manage their own health needs, and believes that NHS Scotland should carry out a full evaluation on how the needs of new hearing aid users can best be met.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-234</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Social Aspect of Bingo Clubs and VAT</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the important social aspect that bingo clubs provide in local communities; notes that they provide a safe environment and are sometimes the sole outlet for communication for some people, many of whom are elderly women; notes that the Bingo Association was supportive of the smoking ban in Scotland but observes that this has contributed to a serious decline in attendance and profits; further notes that the industry is subject to the imposition of 17.5% VAT, while its immediate competitors in bookmaking and casinos are not, and suggests that the VAT taken by HM Treasury should be removed or significantly reduced in order to level the playing field, facilitate the survival of the industry and prevent further closures of bingo clubs in local communities across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-233</strong> <strong>Tom McCabe on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body:</strong> <strong>Members&rsquo; Allowances Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament &mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(a) amends with immediate effect the Resolution of the Parliament of 21 June 2001 agreeing to motion S1M-2034 by substituting &quot;is employed by a member or members&quot; for &quot;remains employed by a single member&quot; in paragraph 1.(7)(a) of Part B of the Members&rsquo; Allowances Scheme referred to in that Resolution; and</p>
  <p>(b) confers functions upon the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to pay allowances in each financial year in accordance with the amended Members&rsquo; Allowances Scheme.</p>
