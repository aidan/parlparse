<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-709</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>European Reform Treaty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that a referendum should be held on the European Reform Treaty.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-708</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Chartered Teacher Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Chartered Teacher scheme is prohibitively expensive and that the achievement of full Chartered Teacher status, allowing teachers to access salary increases of up to &pound;6,500, takes too long, thereby making the achievement of full Chartered Teacher status unrealistic for most teachers; believes that all teachers should be able to access higher salaries in order for the scheme to be a credible part of the salary structure; notes that of Scotland&rsquo;s 20,000 eligible teachers less than 3,500 have registered to work towards Chartered Teacher status and only just over 300 have achieved full accreditation; agrees that this shows that the scheme is not currently within the reach of most teachers and is therefore inequitable; acknowledges that the scheme in its current form creates a false picture of teacher salaries; considers that achieving Chartered Teacher status should be affordable to all members of the profession who are eligible; understands the need for the accreditation route to be streamlined to reduce the amount of time required to achieve full accreditation; realises that the 12 modules required for full accreditation, costing &pound;650 each, effectively price many teachers with young families out of the scheme, and affirms that, in light of this and in the spirit of the McCrone agreement, the Chartered Teacher scheme should be reviewed so that it can achieve its original goal of rewarding experienced teachers who wish to continue to work in the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-707</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>NHS Tayside&rsquo;s Hand Hygiene Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the good work of NHS Tayside&rsquo;s Hand Hygiene Campaign aimed at tackling the unacceptably high incidence of healthcare-associated infections which kill 5,000 people every month in the United Kingdom; deplores the high cost of treating such infections which amounts to &pound;1 billion per year, a sum which could build ten large hospitals; agrees that hand hygiene is the most effective method for preventing cross-infection in the healthcare setting; commends the campaign&rsquo;s approach of raising public awareness, providing resources to GPs and reaching diverse demographic groups such as minorities, travellers and blind people by using specialised media such as a &quot;glow&quot; box, and endorses the campaign&rsquo;s aim of raising awareness among NHS staff and the public as to the importance of effective hand hygiene.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-706</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Independence Referendums in the Basque Country</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of the Basque Government that it will hold two referendums, in 2008 and 2010, in which the Basque people will be asked to vote for independence, and believes that holding referendums will assist the cause of peace, progress and democracy in the Basque Country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-705</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>ASH Scotland Annual Report: Relationship Between Health and Wealth Inequalities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the ASH Scotland Annual Report for 2006-07, particularly the statement it contains that the disparity in smoking rates between the most affluent and the poorest communities points to a growing health inequalities gap in Scotland, and congratulates ASH on its resolution to ensure that inequality-focused work will remain its priority and also remains on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s health agenda.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-704</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Accessible Public Transport For All</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of accessible public transport to communities across Scotland; expresses concern that many private bus operators do not undertake adequate consultation with communities on changes to local bus services; notes that only one bus operator in Scotland is local authority owned, with all others provided by private sector operators; believes that regulated public transport systems are better for the communities that they serve; further believes that transport services should be run for public need, not private profit, and calls on the Scottish Executive to commit to investment in the Scottish bus network and to move towards the re-regulation of bus services in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-691</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-688</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Drink Drive Limit Reduction</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the needless loss of life on Scotland&rsquo;s roads each year due to drink driving; notes that the United Kingdom is now one of only four EU member states that have an 80mg per 100ml of blood drink driving limit; believes that a reduction in the legal drink drive limit to 50mg per 100ml of blood would save many lives; acknowledges that reducing the limit is not currently a devolved power and that implementation would require either legislation at Westminster or devolution of power to the Scottish Parliament; recognises that, in order for the reduction to have maximum impact, a considerable media and enforcement campaign would be required, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to take appropriate measures to reduce the drink driving limit for Scotland, in line with the majority of our European counterparts.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-686&diams;</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Labour&rsquo;s Disingenuous Position on Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the effect that the announced post office closures across Glasgow, central Scotland and Argyll will have on vulnerable members of society, many of whom rely on the essential services that these offices provide; acknowledges that in the debate in the House of Commons on 15 May 2002 opposition parties voted in favour of the motion calling for the Labour government to &quot;set out a clear policy and timetable for heading off a potentially disastrous collapse of the rural and urban network&quot;, while Labour MPs voted against the motion in favour of an amendment that &quot;applauds the Government&rsquo;s decision to accept all 24 of the PIU recommendations in its June 2000 report <em>Counter Revolution-Modernising the Post Office Network</em>&quot;; strongly condemns Ann McKechin MP and other Labour Party members in Glasgow for their disingenuousness in publicly opposing the closures while having voted in favour of recommendations for closure back in 2002, believing that these actions serve to further erode the confidence ordinary people have in their politicians, and believes that misleading constituents for political gain warrants an apology.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-642.1</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-642) in the name of Patrick Harvie, insert at end &quot;believes, however, that the public is becoming increasingly scunnered at being lectured on the need to make personal sacrifices for the sake of the planet by actors, singers and former US presidential hopefuls who are seen to minimise their own tax contributions towards global warming by the expedient of having offshore accounts and highly skilled tax advisors, fly across the world on private jets, own a number of large properties in different parts of the globe, are driven around in gas-guzzling limousines and who have a correspondingly large carbon footprint; believes that cynicism on the need to make lifestyle choices would be tempered if the public saw celebrities and high-profile former politicians actually lead from the front on this issue rather than preach to everyone else; recognises that green politics can be seen as a way of extorting higher taxation from the public, rather than for improving the environment, and urges greater transparency in ensuring that revenues raised are actually invested in projects that directly counter global warming.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-568#</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Crown Estate Taxation on Harbour Developments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vital importance to island and coastal communities of their ports and harbours which serve lifeline transport links and, by supporting such industries as fishing, aquaculture, offshore oil, tourism and renewable energy, provide major employment opportunities; further notes that ports and harbours in the Highlands and Islands are largely owned by local authorities, trusts or other public bodies that operate for the benefit of the communities they serve and reinvest any profits in these communities; views with concern the charges such ports and harbour owners have to pay to the Crown Estate for the rental of areas of seabed; further views with concern the royalty charges imposed by the Crown Estate when material dredged from the seabed to assist navigation is used productively by harbour owners for land reclamation rather than being wastefully dumped at sea, and believes that serious consideration should be given as to how the Parliament&rsquo;s powers to legislate over the property rights of the Crown in Scotland, as outlined in the December 2006 report of the Crown Estate Review Working Group, could be used to lift this unjustifiable burden of Crown Estate taxation from ports and harbour operators.</p>
