    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-431</b> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Mike Tyson</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    notes with grave concern the deplorable action taken by the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, in
    granting Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist, entry into the UK; recognises the great
    disrespect that this action shows to victims of rape; calls upon the Home Secretary to
    reverse his decision and to ensure that in the future financial reasons do not take
    precedence over ethical and legal reasons when considering the entry of convicted
    criminals into the UK, and congratulates Justice for Women for their action taken in the
    High Court to attempt to have this decision overturned.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-430</b> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament endorses the principles of equalising the age of consent for homosexual and
    heterosexual activity and creating a new criminal offence of breach of trust as set out in
    the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill considered by the UK Parliament in the 1998-99
    parliamentary session and agrees that the UK Parliament should consider any Bill
    introduced in the same terms in the current session.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-429</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Capital Receipt Set-Aside Rules</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive&#146;s insistence on continuing to apply Tory
    capital receipt set-aside rules across Scotland&#146;s local authorities; further notes
    that a Scottish Executive instruction to disregard the capital receipt set-aside rule
    would release immediately £138.6 million to be spent on local authority housing, and
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to rescind the capital receipt set-aside rules
    immediately in order to allow approximately 69,000 council homes in Scotland to be fitted
    with either double-glazed windows or central heating systems.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-428</b> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Centre for Crofting and Farming
    Training</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the strong crofting tradition in Sutherland
    and the recent description of the area as &#145;a desert for further and higher
    education&#146;; notes that Drummuie Farm and Technical School in Golspie would be a
    potential base for a Centre for Crofting and Farming Training, and calls upon the
    University of the Highlands and Islands, the community of Golspie and Highland Council to
    work together to explore this and other options for the area.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Alasdair Morgan<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-427#</b> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: National Goose Forum Report</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament acknowledges the financial burden placed on the people of Islay of
    supporting approximately 70% of the world&#146;s population of Greenland geese; notes that
    urgent action is required to alleviate the difficulties faced by the island&#146;s
    livestock and crofting communities caused by the annual migration, and calls for the early
    publication of the Final Report by the National Goose Forum.</p>
