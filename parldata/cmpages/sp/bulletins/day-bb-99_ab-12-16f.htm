    alongside Finnish children at the International Forum on Arts Education in Helsinki and at

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-385#</b> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Review of Licensing Laws</strong>&#151;That

    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-384</b> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament is concerned about the familial exclusion in the Criminal Injuries
    Compensation Scheme; believes the denial of civil compensatory redress for victims of
    incestuous sexual abuse before 1979 is a nonsensical and harmful exclusion; agrees with
    the views expressed by MPs Maria Fyfe and Menzies Campbell that the legal loophole should
    be closed by Westminster and wishes to express its support for victims of sexual assault
    in seeking justice in both the civil and criminal arenas.</p>

    insert &quot;regrets the lower rise in health spending in Scotland in comparison with
    England, in spite of the widening gap in poverty and ill health between north and south;
    opposes the continued reliance on PFI, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to accept its
    responsibility to provide adequate resources in order to support a National Health Service
    in Scotland fit for the 21st Century.&quot; </p>

    motion (S1M-383) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end
    and insert &quot;recognises, however, the rock-bottom morale of NHS staff, most of whom
    are underpaid, overworked and undervalued; believes that the NHS continues to be
    under-funded and demands extra resources immediately to pay salary increases and
    millennium supplements without the imposition of further cuts in service provision and
    staffing levels; recognises that a huge winter crisis in the NHS is looming and commits
    itself to full winter relief for Trusts, many of whom already have severe deficits;
    recognises that the gross inequalities in health across Scotland can only be addressed
    through a combination of increased NHS spending and other anti-poverty measures to improve
    housing conditions, wage levels, benefit levels and pensions and accordingly agrees to
    make urgent representation to the Chancellor to demand the release immediately of the £12
    billion surplus to improve the quality and standard of our public services; condemns the
    use of PFI to fund hospital building as an inefficient use of public resources, the
    continuation of health privatisation and an undermining of NHS workers&#146; jobs and
    conditions, and calls for proper public investment to renovate and re-build our hospitals
    and health facilities.&quot;</p>

    (S1M-383) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and
    insert &quot;but condemns Labour&#146;s centralisation and increase in bureaucracy within
    the NHS and the Executive&#146;s folly of pursuing a raw waiting list target that has led
    to the negation of its promises on health; notes with concern the overspend by health
    boards in the current year, the increasing levels of bed blocking and the failure of the
    Arbuthnot Report to address inequality in health spending; believes that the development
    of a modern NHS depends on a sustained programme of service redesign, greater public
    accountability and involvement and true partnership working across the NHS in Scotland,
    and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make the reduction of waiting times and access to
    treatment on the basis of clinical need its top priority for all the NHS in
    Scotland.&quot;</p>
