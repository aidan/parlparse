<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4668</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Panorama: Britain&rsquo;s Homecare Scandal  - an example of  investigative journalism at its best</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave concern regarding the arrest of Arif Farooq, the journalist who, with her colleagues in the <em>Panorama </em>programme, Britain&rsquo;s Homecare Scandal, exposed scandalously poor quality of care experienced by elderly people in their own homes; notes that the programme has prompted action by the Scottish Government and an inquiry by the Parliament&rsquo;s Local Government and Communities Committee into home care; applauds all those involved in producing a powerful programme, which is already ensuring more protection for older people who rely on home care;  believes that this <em>Panorama</em> programme is in the finest tradition of investigative journalism, and is concerned that while undercover journalism and any methods involving deception must be closely monitored and operate within clear conditions, the action by the police in this instance could deter journalists from one of their core purposes of exposing wrongdoing, cruelty and neglect.</p>
<p>Supported by: Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4667</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Maryhill and Possilpark, Town Centre Regeneration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the award of &pound;1.8 million to Maryhill Burgh Halls from the Town Centre Regeneration Fund; notes that this completes the funding package for the regeneration of the Burgh Halls that will see the building restored to its former glory for community use; further notes that a working group is drawing up a bid for the regeneration of Saracen Street in Possilpark in the second round of Town Centre Regeneration Fund applications; welcomes the community support that this has received through petition signatures and community consultation; hopes that this bid will succeed in order to complement the regeneration of the wider Possilpark community, and further hopes, given the huge demand for town centre regeneration funding across Scotland, that the Scottish Government will continue this fund into future years.</p>
<p>Supported by: Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong>, Des McNulty<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4666</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Tombstoning, Jumping into the Unknown</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the dangerous practice of tombstoning, a potentially lethal practice&nbsp;that involves jumping into the sea, rivers and lochs from a cliff or other high point;&nbsp;further notes with concern the incidence of tombstoning in areas of north east Scotland, including Arbroath and the ongoing occurrence of tombstoning&nbsp;at both coastal and inland locations across Scotland;&nbsp;also notes with concern that in the United Kingdom tombstoning has killed&nbsp;10 and seriously injured 26 people since 2005;&nbsp;again notes with concern&nbsp;that tombstoning not only puts the lives of all those directly involved at risk but also takes up a significant amount of time of the emergency services; notes&nbsp;also with concern the emergence of websites and videos promoting this dangerous activity&nbsp;that often give a false impression that tombstoning is risk-free, which&nbsp;can lead to copycat behaviour; welcomes the&nbsp;joint efforts to address this issue&nbsp;between police forces&nbsp;and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and in particular congratulates the local collaborative approach taken between Tayside Police and the MCA, which has resulted in a local education campaign in schools, warning of the dangers of tombstoning, a&nbsp;campaign leaflet focussed on holiday-makers and an appropriate enforcement strategy; notes the need for a dual approach of education and enforcement, and finally welcomes the ongoing Don&rsquo;t&nbsp;Jump into the&nbsp;Unknown campaign, run by the MCA, that aims to raise awareness among young people about the risks involved in tombstoning.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4665</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Inquiry into Allegations of MI5 and MI6 Complicity in Torture</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of a parliamentary report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights calling for an inquiry into allegations of MI5 and MI6 complicity in torture; agrees with the report that a system whereby ministers have been able to shirk responsibility and accountability by providing hollow blanket denials is &quot;woefully deficient&quot;; believes the practice of assisting other states in the commission of torture, or acquiescing in such torture, to be abhorrent; further notes that, according to a poll published by the PoliticsHome website, 65% of voters believe that the UK&rsquo;s moral authority on the international stage has been weakened over the last 10 years as a result of government foreign policy, and calls on the UK Government to take heed of the calls of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and embark on a full inquiry, as soon as is possible, into this matter.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4660</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Prison Overcrowding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disappointed by the hypocrisy of Labour politicians who complain on the one hand that Scottish prisons have record levels of overcrowding, a direct result of their failure to invest in new prisons, while at the same time castigating the Scottish Government for not locking up enough people.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4653</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>BBC Trust Support for Scottish Football on Terrestrial TV</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision from the BBC Trust in its submission to the UK Government&rsquo;s Department for Culture, Media and Sport to seek the protection of Scottish international football matches by adding live home and away qualifiers to the A-list, giving them the same level of protection as the Scottish Cup, and believes that this is a significant step forward in the campaign to return live Scottish football to terrestrial television where it is available to the widest possible audience.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4647 *#*</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Campaign Against Diageo Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, further to motion S3M-4568 lodged on 6 July 2009, notes that a major cross-party campaign has been established to oppose Diageo&rsquo;s restructuring proposals that would see the closure of plants at Kilmarnock, Hurlford and Port Dundas with the loss of hundreds of jobs in the Scotch whisky industry and a devastating impact on local communities; endorses the statement by the First Minister calling these proposals socially unacceptable; welcomes the action of the Scottish Government in commissioning an alternative business plan for consideration by Diageo, and echoes the call of thousands of people who took part in the march and rally in Kilmarnock on 26 July for a secure and successful future for the workers and their communities and for the company.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4646 *#*</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Tokyo Beer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the extent of health and criminal justice problems associated with excessive and unhealthy alcohol consumption in Glasgow and other parts of Scotland; notes the production of Tokyo beer by BrewDog brewery; further notes that Tokyo is being cited as Britain&rsquo;s strongest beer; is concerned that, with an alcohol content of 18.2%, each 330ml bottle will contain the equivalent of six units of alcohol, which is twice the recommended daily limit for women set by health professionals; recognises the significant health and social harms associated with irresponsible drinking; further recognises that major cultural change is required if Scotland is to tackle its damaging relationship with alcohol, and therefore believes that promoting drinks of this kind with both a very high alcohol content and unit volume is reprehensible in a society where the medical evidence shows that, across all age groups and socio-economic categories, individuals are drinking too much alcohol.</p>
