<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the<a href="#end"> end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4280#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Job Losses, Profits and Subsidies at Hewlett-Packard, Erskine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores and deeply regrets the short-sighted decision of the management of Hewlett-Packard to dismiss 843 employees at their Erskine site in order to outsource their jobs to plants in the Czech Republic; is well aware of the company&rsquo;s profits of &pound;5.2 billion in 2008 and of the substantial public funds given to the company based on assurances offered by company representatives in the past; views with scepticism the claim made by management that the remaining jobs at the Renfrewshire plant are comparatively safe; believes that the interests of shareholders will always swamp the needs and expectations of loyal and hard-working employees, and hopes that the dreadful consequences of this decision can be avoided.</p>
<p>Supported by: Cathy Peattie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4279</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Overseas Perfomers Don&rsquo;t Deserve Terrorist Treatment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the ramifications of the Home Office&rsquo;s new immigration controls on non-EU artists who require a sponsor to allow them to enter the United Kingdom, as highlighted by the treatment of Canadian singer Allison Crowe and several band members who were held for 11 hours in Gatwick Airport before being barred from entering the UK to tour and visit friends in the north west Highlands; considers that Ms Crowe was treated as little better than a terrorist after enduring an 11-hour ordeal where she was locked up, questioned, had her fingerprints taken, her passport stamped &quot;barred from entry&quot; and was then deported; contends that this is no way to treat a legitimate and repeat visitor to the UK; urges the Home Office to rethink this draconian policy before it harms cultural links to Scotland and the wider UK; notes that Ms Crowe is allowed to perform in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic and will do so; furthermore notes the German authorities&rsquo; reported reaction to the situation that they were horrified at the British treatment and that Allison would be welcomed to perform in Germany, and asserts that visitors to Scotland during the Year of Homecoming deserve a civilised and warm welcome.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4278#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Glasgow Central and West Local Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all who took part in the seventh Glasgow Community Awards event in Partick Burgh Halls on 28 May 2009; further congratulates Radio Lollipop, based in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Yorkhill, for winning the Community Team Award, Margaret Khan from Garnethill for winning the Community Individual Award, John Campbell from Hillhead School for winning the Community Public Service Individual Award, Betty Dougan from Townhead for winning the Community Neighbour Award, Glasgow Old People&rsquo;s Welfare Association (GOPWA) for winning the Community Service Team Award and Youth Voices for winning the Community Young People&rsquo;s Award; pays tribute to all who took part; recognises that their actions prove that community spirit is alive and well in Glasgow, and looks forward to the Gala Final later this year.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4277</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Children&rsquo;s Orchard</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Children&rsquo;s Orchard for making the shortlist for the TFN Scottish Charity Awards&rsquo; Community Action Award; notes that the Children&rsquo;s Orchard aims to create a fruitful Scotland through the simple initiative of creating orchards in Scotland&rsquo;s urban areas; also notes that, stemming from Glasgow&rsquo;s Botanic Gardens, the Children&rsquo;s Orchard began as an outreach project to plant fruit trees in the city&rsquo;s George Square; further notes that the organisation has worked with 100 Glasgow schools to plant trees in their local areas and has supported work in Edinburgh, Perth and Kinross and other parts of Scotland, and wishes the project the best of luck at the awards and in its Commonwealth Orchard project, which aims to plant 2,014 trees across Scotland in time for the Glasgow Commonwealth Games 2014.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3357#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Support for Unpaid Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vital role played by unpaid carers across Scotland in providing essential care and support to people whose lives are seriously affected by illness or disability and the work done to support carers by the Voice of Carers Across Lothian (VOCAL) in Edinburgh and the Coalition of Carers in Scotland; notes that the estimated replacement cost for unpaid carers in Edinburgh has increased by &pound;98.3 million to &pound;554.5 million; is concerned that one in five carers has given up work to provide care, the same proportion suffer poor health, only 40% have had a break from their responsibilities of more than two days and 73% live in fuel poverty, and therefore considers that the contribution made by unpaid carers to the Scottish economy should be recognised by improving the sharing of best practice in the provision of support with other European countries and local authorities across the United Kingdom and by improving the quality of support available for respite care, training, support services and young carers in Scotland.</p>
