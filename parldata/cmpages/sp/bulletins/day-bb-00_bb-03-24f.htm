    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-692#</b> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Unemployment in East Ayrshire</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that east Ayrshire is the worst unemployment blackspot in Scotland
    outside Glasgow; further notes that only 59 per cent of people of working age living in
    East Ayrshire are in employment, or on a government training scheme, in comparison with a
    Scottish average of 71 per cent, and believes that revision of current policies is
    necessary to reverse this situation and to promote significant levels of job creation and
    economic growth in this area.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Michael Russell<strong>*</strong>, Andrew Wilson<strong>*</strong>,
    Mr Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Mr Lloyd Quinan<strong>*</strong>, Michael
    Matheson<strong>*</strong>, Fergus Ewing<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-691#</b> <strong>Bristow Muldoon: DAKS-Simpson</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with concern potential redundancies at DAKS-Simpson factories at Larkhall
    and Polbeth following the decision by Marks and Spencer to end their contract with the
    company; recognises DAKS-Simpson&#146;s reputation for producing quality clothing;
    welcomes moves by the company to pursue alternative sources of orders; believes that Marks
    and Spencer should reconsider their decision to end their contract, and considers that the
    Scottish Executive should do all in its power to support DAKS-Simpson in its quest to
    secure new orders.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Karen Gillon<strong>*</strong>, Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Hugh Henry<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-690#</b> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Fast Ferry Across the Forth Estuary</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that the rate of increase of traffic using the Forth Road Bridge is
    not sustainable; believes that alternative estuary crossings must be examined to alleviate
    congestion and to allow the free-flow of commuters and visitors between Edinburgh and
    Fife, and believes that consideration should be given to studies already undertaken for a
    fast ferry service between Fife and Edinburgh with a view to examining the feasibility of
    implementation.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-689#</b> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: A75</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes
    that the A75 plays a vital economic role in Dumfries and Galloway, that it serves as the
    principal route for the region&#146;s transport infrastructure, and that it also serves as
    the main Euroroute between Cork and the Irish Republic and the Benelux countries of the
    European Union; notes therefore the role that the A75 plays in the economies of the South
    West of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Eire and the North of England, and believes that the
    trunk road spending programme should be reviewed to include the upgrading of the A75.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-688</b> <strong>Michael Russell: Chair of Celtic, Humboldt University,
    Berlin</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive to follow the
    example of the Republic of Ireland by taking positive steps to support the retention of
    the Chair of Celtic Studies at Humboldt University, Berlin, a European centre of academic
    excellence in the Celtic languages, including Scottish Gaelic.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-687#</b> <strong>George Lyon: Islay Creamery</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    notes with grave concern the closure of Islay Creamery with the direct loss of eight jobs
    and possibly many more indirectly and invites the Scottish Executive, in partnership with
    Argyll and Islands Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Argyll and Bute Council
    and the dairy industry on Islay, to formulate a long term strategy to allow farmers to
    diversify and restructure their business. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-686#</b> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Bus Drivers' Strike</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes the disruption to public transport in Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway
    as a consequence of industrial action in Stagecoach (Western Scottish) Bus Company; notes
    that this dispute was caused by the company&#146;s withdrawal of their latest pay offer,
    and requests that the management of Stagecoach immediately resume negotiations with trade
    union representatives with the aim of resolving this dispute.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong>, Karen Gillon<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-685</b> <strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: Take Your Daughters to Work Day</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament welcomes and supports &quot;Take Your Daughters to Work Day&quot; on 27
    April and encourages Members to give young people, both male and female, the chance to
    experience working in the Parliament on that day.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-684</b> <strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: Standards in Scotland's Schools etc.
    Bill (Stage 2 order of consideration)</strong>&#151;That the Education, Culture and Sport
    Committee considers the Bill at Stage 2 in the following order: sections 1-12, sections
    41-51, sections 13-40, sections 52-57 and that each schedule is considered immediately
