          <p><strong>*S2M-891</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Contraceptive 
            Awareness Week</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 9 to 15 February 
            2004 is Contraceptive Awareness Week and congratulates the sexual 
            health charity, fpa, for launching this initiative to help raise awareness 
            on issues relating to contraception; further notes the wide range 
            of activities planned to mark this week, and, in particular, welcomes 
            the work being done by fpa, along with other agencies including the 
            National Union of Students, to promote awareness and understanding 
            among young people.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-890</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Nuclear 
            Waste</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned that policies related 
            to nuclear waste management are being discussed and debated at UK 
            and European level without significant input from Scotland; believes 
            that appropriate statutory guidance for the Scottish Environment Protection 
            Agency on radioactive discharges is urgently required, and considers 
            that decisions regarding the control, management and disposal of nuclear 
            waste material in Scotland should be a matter solely for the Scottish 
            Ministers.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-889</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>The 
            Future of Scottish Football</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            crisis faced by Scottish football; recognises football's importance 
            in terms of its economic, social and health benefits and also its 
            contribution to our culture and identity; sympathises with the backroom 
            and playing staff of those clubs worst affected; calls on professional 
            football clubs to work with their supporters to harness the emotional 
            and financial investment they make in their clubs; calls on the football 
            authorities and clubs to ensure better business planning and financial 
            management; believes that public funding for the game is essential 
            but not the bail out of individual clubs; welcomes current and proposed 
            financial support from the Scottish Executive but calls for such support 
            to be matched by structural change; calls for the Scottish Football 
            Association (SFA) to be a more integrated governing body for the game; 
            calls for the SFA to review the professional league structure in Scotland 
            and the criteria for membership, and further calls for the SFA to 
            regulate and develop participation by all ages and at all levels from 
            grassroots in the community through to the national team.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-888</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>City 
            of Edinburgh Council Social Work Crisis</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that the City of Edinburgh Council's Social Work Department 
            needs assistance if it is to attract staff to fill its 32% vacancy 
            rate in social work posts and pursue a concerted recruitment campaign; 
            further believes that the council needs to offer a greatly improved 
            pay and conditions package and regrading commitment to prevent staff 
            leaving the profession, and believes that the proposed reorganisation 
            of the department would lower morale further.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-887#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Attack 
            on Free Personal Care Policy</strong>-That the Parliament deplores 
            the attack on the policy of free personal care by former Scottish 
            Executive Minister, Sam Galbraith, and the offence caused to older 
            people by his remarks; rejects the assertion that cancer services 
            have suffered because of the decision to fund free personal care; 
            is concerned about the negative impact his comments will have on both 
            older people and cancer patients; is pleased that the policy of free 
            personal care has helped to tackle some of the discrimination towards 
            those with an age-related illness, and believes that this policy has 
            been of huge benefit to many thousands of Scotland's elderly people 
            and one of the most successful achievements of the Scottish Parliament.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-886</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie on behalf of the Selection Panel:</strong> <strong>Appointment 
            of the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland</strong>-That 
            the Parliament nominates Kathleen Marshall to Her Majesty The Queen 
            for appointment as the Commissioner for Children and Young People 
            in Scotland.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, 
            Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-885</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Days 
            at Sea and the Safety of Our Fishermen</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the dangers that fishermen face in the pursuit of their 
            work to provide us with high quality produce; deplores the fact that 
            the deal reached at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels 
            failed to take into account <em>force majeure</em>, the impact of 
            bad weather on fishing time or time taken for vessels to steam to 
            and from fishing grounds; notes the impact that this will have on 
            the safety of our fishermen at sea, and calls upon Her Majesty's Government 
            to negotiate an increase in days at sea to ensure that the safety 
            of our fishermen is not further compromised by the Common Fisheries 
            Policy.</P>
