          <p><strong>*S2M-982</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Twentieth 
            Anniversary of the Miners' Strike</strong>-That the Parliament recalls 
            the historic events of the 1984-85 miners' strike which began 20 years 
            ago this month; believes that, looking back, it was not only the most 
            bitter political division in post-war Britain but also a turning point 
            in politics, and believes that the defeat of the National Union of 
            Mineworkers, after a brave and heroic struggle, ushered in two decades 
            of unremitting attack on the rights of working people, their trade 
            unions, their employment rights and their communities and had far-reaching 
            political consequences across the world.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-981</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Nursery Nurses</strong>-That the Parliament appreciates the excellent 
            pre-school education and care that nursery nurses deliver to Scotland's 
            children; notes that their pay has not been reviewed for a considerable 
            length of time and that the current pay negotiations have been ongoing 
            for more than three years; regrets that nursery nurses have felt obliged 
            to take industrial action in support of their pay claim; notes that 
            the situation is no closer to being resolved; calls on UNISON and 
            COSLA to redouble their efforts to find a solution and end the dispute, 
            and further calls on the Scottish Executive to intervene to ensure 
            that a national agreement is forthcoming, taking into account the 
            new roles and responsibilities of nursery nurses in delivering national 
            policies for the pre-5 curriculum, early education intervention measures, 
            early identification of children with special support needs and vital 
            support to deliver mainstreaming in education as established under 
            the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc. Act 2000.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-980</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> 
            <strong>P&agrave;rlamaid nan Oileanach</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the fifth Gaelic students' Parliament, <em>P&agrave;rlamaid 
            nan Oileanach,</em> which will be taking place in Armagh this year 
            from 14 to 16 March 2004; welcomes its contribution to the debate 
            on diversity, and praises its organisers <em>Iomairt Chaluim Chille, 
            </em>the Columba Initiative<em>, </em>for this important scheme which 
            aims to bring together young Gaelic speakers from Scotland, the Republic 
            of Ireland and Northern Ireland and to encourage participation in 
            the democratic process.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-975</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Gift 
            Aid</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that the future 
            of at least six of Scotland's leading visitor attractions has been 
            thrown into jeopardy by plans by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to 
            change the rules on gift aid donations to wildlife and heritage charities 
            such as Edinburgh Zoo, Scotland's second most popular visitor attraction, 
            along with five of Scotland's five star visitor attractions, the Royal 
            Yacht <em>Britannia</em>, Discovery Point and Verdant Works, Dundee, 
            the Scottish Seabird Centre, North Berwick, and the Scottish Mining 
            Museum, Newtongrange, which would all, as a consequence, face serious 
            financial difficulties; notes that some of these attractions may even 
            face the possibility of closure should the public's ability to donate 
            their admission charge to these charities be withdrawn, as proposed, 
            in April 2005; notes that these attractions contribute millions of 
            pounds to their local economies and between them employ over 400 people; 
            notes that in 2003 the benefit of gift aid tax rebates to these four 
            attractions accounted for approximately 10 to 20% of their admission 
            income and, given their very marginal commercial viability, they may 
            now have to face some serious choices with regard to their long-term 
            future, and accordingly calls upon the Scottish Executive to make 
            urgent representations to the Chancellor to retain the current gift 
            aid scheme insofar as it affects these vital visitor attractions.<strong><em>
