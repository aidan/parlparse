                          recognises the possible correlation between participation 
                          in the UK’s Nuclear Test Programme in the 1950s and 
                          the development of subsequent illnesses; congratulates 
                          Dundee University on its progress toward the development 
                          of a new diagnostic procedure and management clinic 
                          for individuals exposed to injurious amounts of ionising 
                          radiation, and supports the University’s attempts to 
                          develop a centre of excellence to deal with the health 
                          hazards of long term and accidental radiation exposure.
