<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only  printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the  complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is  published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains any motions lodged  for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for  debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol  (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (u).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a  declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3388 Rosie Kane: Population  Deficit and Glasgow School Closures&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the  Scottish Executive for all and any initiatives it takes to reverse the skills  and population deficit in Scotland; recognises that a dwindling population is  an economic time bomb which threatens health, education, social work and many  other essential services which the people of Scotland will surely always rely  on; looks forward to toasting the success of the Executive in this extremely  important challenge; expresses concern that if the Executive is successful  there will not be enough schools in Glasgow to educate its growing young  population if Glasgow City Council proceeds with its current plans to cut back  on and close schools throughout the city; notes that this includes 51  primaries, 22 pre-five centres, four special educational needs units and one  bilingual support unit, and finally is concerned that this measure shows little  confidence on the part of Labour-led Glasgow City Council in the success of the  Executive&rsquo;s initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3387 Mr Adam Ingram: Treatment  for Mild Depression&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that spending on  anti-depressant prescribing is 40% higher in Scotland than in England;  recognises that the recent English National Institute for Clinical Excellence  guideline on depression found non-pharmacological treatments to be at least as  effective as anti-depressants in the treatment of mild depression, and supports  the proposal from Depression Alliance Scotland that a SIGN guideline on the  non-pharmacological treatment of mild to moderate depression in adults in  primary care should be developed for Scotland as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3386 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Freedom  of Glasgow for Harry Benson&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises the immense  contribution of Harry Benson, one of Glasgow&rsquo;s most famous sons and one of the  world&rsquo;s foremost photographers; agrees that his images of some of the most  famous people and historic events of the second half of the 20th century are a  priceless record of those decades; believes that, in recognition of his  contribution to art, photography and historical record, the city of Glasgow  should honour his lifetime of achievement, and calls on Glasgow City Council to  award Harry Benson the freedom of the city.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3385 John Farquhar Munro: Condemnation of the Crown Estate Commission at Annat Bay&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament condemns the decision of the Crown Estate Commission (CEC) to allow  consent for a new salmon farm in Annat Bay, near Ullapool, overturning the  democratic decision taken by the Highland Council after extensive consultation  with the local community; believes that the interim guidance that the Scottish  Executive has introduced gives carte blanche to the CEC to continue to ignore  the views of the local community and the management of the local environment in  order to maximise its revenue; notes that it is nearly three years since the  Parliament voted for planning controls for marine fish farms to be transferred  to local authorities; regrets the lack of urgency by the Executive in bringing  into force the relevant section in the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland)  Act 2003, and calls on it to end the interim measures as soon as possible and  ensure that any decisions taken under interim arrangements can be reviewed by  the democratically elected local authorities.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3384# Christine Grahame: Haddington  Citizens Advice Bureau&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament commends the work of citizens  advice bureaux throughout Scotland, of which Haddington Citizens Advice Bureau  is typical; notes that in 2004-05 it opened 2,015 new cases with an increase in  drop-in and telephone access and that &pound;117,083 was secured for clients, but  that premises and funding for staff continue to be its main priorities for service  development; notes with concern the increasing demand for the Money Advice  Service, with the level of debt increased by 25% from the previous year making  more demands on the service; is most concerned that this service is now  stretched to its limits; further notes with regret that the Good Advice Better  Health Clinics in Berwick, Cockenzie, Port Seton and Tranent have lost  continuation funding and that the hours of the Project Worker at the one GP  Advice Clinic in Dunbar have been reduced from 25 to seven per week when 56  patients accessed this service, there were 177 contacts from third parties and &pound;26,685  was secured for clients from a small investment in the service of &pound;6,500;  considers that all of these services are invaluable to individuals and the  community at large, and considers that the Scottish Executive should reconsider  their funding now.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3383 Frances Curran: Water  Charges&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament believes that monies should be made available  in the forthcoming investment period to deal with the backlog of historic  under-investment in assets and infrastructure in the water industry; recognises  that the impact of not dealing with this backlog could result in much greater  costs in future and a large increase in water charges in the next review period;  calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that Scottish Water is given adequate  funding to fulfil its core functions, including promoting sustainable  development and meeting obligations for biodiversity within the charge caps  proposed by the Water Industry Commissioner, and further calls for all  Executive objectives, essential and desirable, to be delivered to achieve a  degree of compliance with environmental regulation.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3382 Frances Curran: Justice  for Co-op Financial Advisers&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament condemns the actions of  the Co-operative Insurance Society in writing to over 2,000 of its financial  advisers, threatening to sack them if they do not sign up to new terms and  conditions; notes with concern that these new terms and conditions could lead  to earnings being reduced by around 30% and that refusal to accept these  conditions could lead to employees receiving dismissal notices from 17 October  2005; is further concerned that the employer has refused to agree to binding  arbitration which has been offered by Usdaw, the trade union representing the  threatened workers; offers support and solidarity with the Usdaw members who  have now voted in favour of strike action with a two-to-one majority; agrees  with the workers that the Co-op&rsquo;s intractability has left them with no other  option; believes that the Co-op&rsquo;s actions in this dispute bring its reputation  as an ethical and esteemed community-based co-operative organisation into  disrepute, such action being more in keeping with the activities of  multi-national corporations against workers in Latin American countries such as  Colombia, and urges the company to, at the very least, agree to the compromise  offered by Usdaw members of entering into binding arbitration talks or, at  best, withdraw these threats of dismissal and maintain fair and favourable  terms and conditions for all of its employees.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3381 Michael Matheson: Scottish  Olympic Team&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates London on securing the 2012  Olympic Games, which will encourage many young Scots to become involved in  sport; welcomes the recent launch of a campaign to establish a Scottish Olympic  team; notes that 78 percent of Scots support the establishment of such a team;  recognises that the creation of a Scottish Olympic team will inspire many young  Scots to achieve sporting excellence in order to represent their nation in the  Olympic arena, and calls on politicians from across the political spectrum to  rise up to the challenge set by the people of Scotland and work to establish a  Scottish Olympic team.</p>
