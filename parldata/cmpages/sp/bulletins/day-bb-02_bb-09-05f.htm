          <p><strong>*S1M-3355</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Erskine Hospital</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the management and staff at Erskine Hospital 
            for the creation of the excellent Erskine Bursary Scheme which, in 
            co-operation with other care providers, will ensure that former servicemen 
            and women will receive first-class care in care homes near to their 
            families, friends and communities and believes that Erskine Hospital 
            stands alongside the very best of care providers for service veterans 
            and sets a benchmark for such services in relation to those who have 
            served in the armed forces and who in retirement deserve no less.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3354#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Crisis in 
            Borders Public Sewerage System</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern that there is no further capacity in water waste treatment 
            works in some towns and villages in the Scottish Borders such as Duns, 
            Earlston, Lauder, Newtown St Boswells, Stow, Peebles and West Linton; 
            further notes that, as a consequence, developments are being delayed 
            or restricted and that Scottish Water's current investment programme 
            will be unable to resolve some of these issues until, for instance, 
            2004-05 in Peebles and 2005-06 in Earlston, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency, convene a meeting 
            with representatives of Scottish Borders Council, the Chief Executive 
            of Scottish Water, the Water Commissioner for Scotland and relevant 
            MSPs.</p>

            Services Ombudsman Act 2002 (Amendment) Order 2002</strong>-That the 
            Transport and the Environment Committee recommends that the Scottish 
            Public Services Ombudsman Act 2002 (Amendment) Order 2002 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3352</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Support for Crofting 
            in the Highlands and Islands</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            importance of crofting to the Highlands and Islands; welcomes the 
            publication of the White Paper on crofting reform and encourages crofters 
            to participate in the consultation now underway; further notes the 
            level of agricultural returns to crofting businesses and supports 
            the agri-environmental focus that the Environmentally Sensitive Area 
            scheme has brought to many crofting counties, and encourages continuing 
            support to crofting through such measures as the Crofting Counties 
            Agricultural Grants scheme. </p>

            motion (S1M-3351) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &quot;and 
            believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;but believes that the difficulties 
            for young people leaving care should be addressed at an earlier stage 
            to give them the best chance of coping with the challenges of successful 
            adult living.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3351.2</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Throughcare and

            to end and insert &quot;urges the Executive to endorse the recommendations 
            highlighted in the report and to ensure their adequate resourcing 
            and effective implementation.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3350.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Scottish Fuel Poverty 
            Statement</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3350) in the name 
            of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from the first &quot;recognises&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Executive's self-congratulation 
            is unfounded given that substantial inroads into eradicating fuel 
            poverty were made by previous Conservative governments, and recognises 
            that the policies of those Conservative governments have had a lasting 
            effect and that many of them have been continued by the Scottish Executive 
            under a different name.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3350.2</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Scottish 
            Fuel Poverty Statement</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3350) 
            in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out 
            from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the publication 
            of the Fuel Poverty Statement and the positive developments contained 
            within it; accepts the need for a single entry point to the plethora 
            of grant schemes and initiatives available; believes that, to eliminate 
            fuel poverty, resources both human and financial must be in place 
            to meet this aim; urges the Scottish Executive to extend the Warm 
            Deal and Central Heating Programme to disabled people, the long-term 
            sick and all pensioners with partial or obsolete systems at the earliest 
            possible opportunity; considers the establishment of a Decent Homes 
            Standard as fundamental to reducing fuel poverty, not least through 
            energy efficiency measures; has serious concerns regarding hard to 
            heat homes, the inflexible application of criteria used in the Central 
            Heating Programme, the delay in installing central heating in Glasgow's 
            socially rented sector and the Executive's definition of fuel poverty, 
            and seeks the commitment of the Executive to liaise with Her Majesty's 
            Government on issues such as debt blocking, pre-payment meters and 
            benefit uptake&quot;.</a> </p>

            Invasion of Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">is 
            opposed to the invasion of Iraq by USA forces and *believes that* 
            the Prime Minister *should* try to dissuade President Bush from such

            the Middle East and would almost certainly destroy the lives of many
