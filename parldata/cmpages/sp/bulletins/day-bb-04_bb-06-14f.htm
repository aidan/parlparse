            Health Week, Scotland: 14 to 20 June 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            pledges support for Men's Health Week, Scotland, from 14 to 20 June 
            2004; acknowledges efforts by all sectors to publicise Men's Health 
            Week, Scotland and recognises and welcomes the work undertaken by 
            the Men's Health Forum Scotland generally; recognises that men have 
            a lower life expectancy, higher suicide rate and a higher death rate 
            from diseases such as cancer and heart disease than women; further 
            recognises that men are less likely to have chronic diseases identified 
            and treated early and that men attend their GPs less than half as 
            often as women; notes that as the population of Scotland ages the 
            burden of treating and caring for increasing numbers of men living 
            longer with chronic disease will be resource-intensive; believes that 
            prevention of such diseases should be a focus for Scottish health 
            policy, and calls upon MSPs to assist ongoing collaborations by promoting 
            positive messages about healthy ageing, men's health and Men's Health 
            Week, encouraging more men to take responsibility for their own health 
            and well-being.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1460</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Roxburgh 
            Citizens Advice Bureau: 30 Years of Serving the Community</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the invaluable work of Citizens Advice Bureau 
            offices Scotland-wide and notes that, in the past year of its work, 
            Roxburgh Citizens Advice Bureau, like bureaux Scotland-wide, has offered 
            free, confidential and independent information, advice and advocacy 
            on any subject to anyone who requests it and also helps the community 
            by campaigning on social issues; notes that this year alone it helped 
            the public to claim £805,658 to which they were entitled, and congratulates 
            all volunteers, past and present, as it celebrates&nbsp;30 years of 
            service in the community.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1459</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Improvement 
            in Scottish Small Business Sector</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the publication of the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland 
            membership survey, <em>Lifting Barriers to Growth in UK Small Businesses 
            2004</em>, in particular the findings that 58% of its members had 
            experienced an increase in turnover in the past 12 months, that nearly 
            a third have increased their number of employees, that there has been 
            a rapid rise in uptake of broadband from 3% in 2002 to 21% in 2003 
            and an increase in the number of women who own a small business and 
            that more than half expect their business to grow within the next 
            two years and, furthermore, supports the work of the Scottish Executive, 
            Scottish Enterprise and the Business Gateways in helping small businesses 
            to achieve growth.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1458</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Call 
            for Resignation of Scottish Opera Chairman, Duncan McGhie</strong>-That 
            the Parliament supports the chorus of Scottish Opera and the union, 
            Equity, in their fight to retain jobs for singers in Scotland and 
            believes that the chairman of Scottish Opera, Duncan McGhie, who has 
            failed to ensure that the company spends according to its income, 
            failed to ensure the continuity of productions and failed to retain 
            jobs for his staff, should resign.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1457#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 
            Marriage Counselling Service - Couple Counselling Scotland</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the excellent work done by Glasgow Marriage 
            Counselling Service (GMCS) in association with Couple Counselling 
            Scotland; notes, in particular, their expertise and involvement with 
            families where children are drawn into partnership dysfunction that 
            requires the assistance of well-trained couple counsellors; is aware 
            that training costs around £5,500 per counsellor, of which £3,500 
            is paid by counsellors who later give their time on a voluntary basis; 
            is astonished that such an essential service to families which is 
            in line with the principles set out in the Scottish Executive consultation 
            paper, <em>Family Matters: Improving Family Law in Scotland</em>, 
            does not have direct funding and depends on varying levels of support 
            for such services from local authorities, and notes with concern that 
            one local authority has indicated its intention to reduce substantially 
            their vital support of GMCS with attendant consequences for the service.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1456#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Scottish Nappy Company for Winning a Scottish Business in the Community 
            Award</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Nappy Company 
            was presented with an Award for Excellence at the Scottish Business 
            in the Community celebration dinner on 3 June 2004; commends the excellent 
            service that companies like the Scottish Nappy Company offer to parents 
            in Scotland who are seeking an uncomplicated and inexpensive means 
            to reuse cotton nappies; recognises that, on average, 60% of a disposable 
            nappy is non-biodegradable and that their usage creates 1,000,000 
            tonnes of waste in Great Britain every year, much of it ending up 
            in landfill, and recognises that reusable cotton nappies provide a 
            practical and environmentally-sustainable alternative to disposable 
            nappies.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1455</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>The 
            Scottish Outdoor Access Code: Proposed Code (SE/2004/101)</strong>-That 
            the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the Scottish Outdoor Access 
            Code: Proposed Code (SE/2004/101) be approved.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1454</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Dalziel 
            High School, Motherwell</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Dalziel High School in Motherwell on the success of its development 
            and marketing of the school's own-label healthy options of low-fat 
            and low-salt potato crisps and bottled water; believes that this enterprise 
            is a fine example of the entrepreneurial spirit of Scotland's young 
            people and potentially a positive step in the battle to provide healthy 
            eating options for our young people, and calls for similar projects 
            to be explored and instigated by Scotland's other local authorities.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1453</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Parkhead 
            Citizens Advice Bureau</strong>-That the Parliament regrets Glasgow 
            City Council's decision to award Parkhead Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) 
            only £65,969 of the £104,845 requested in the service level agreement 
            that was submitted for the running of core services; notes that this 
            will result in a 40% reduction in Parkhead CAB's service to clients 
            and will have a significant impact on the lives of people within the 
            east end of Glasgow; further notes that last year the bureau assisted 
            with over 7,000 client contacts and over 10,000 problems, formally 
            represented over 300 clients at tribunals and in the Sheriff Court 
            and secured over £830,000 in financial gain for clients; is extremely 
            concerned that other Glasgow citizen's advice bureaux and advice providers 
            are facing problems in securing funding for their valuable services, 
            and therefore urges Glasgow City Council to increase substantially 
            Parkhead CAB's grant to allow the bureau to continue to operate at 
            its current level of service.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1452</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Homeless 
            World Cup 2004</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Jamie Shearer, 
            Kevin Short, Robert Cairney, David Duke, Gary Kimmet, Eddie O'Neill, 
            Owen Turner, Phil Garden, Shawn Schofield, Thomas Comrie, Mark Elliot 
            and John McAnnany who have been selected to represent Scotland in 
            the Homeless World Cup which will be staged in Gothenburg, Sweden 
            in July 2004; regrets, furthermore, that last year our magnificent 
            team, who picked up a trophy in their group, were not given the send 
            off, media coverage or welcome that they deserve and hopes that the 
            Parliament will attempt to rectify that shortfall this year by getting 
            behind our boys and actively promoting them; further notes that the 
            Homeless World Cup team is not only a successful and winning team, 
            but is also an example of huge triumph over often extreme difficulty 
            and to this end deserves the support, encouragement and praise of 
            the Parliament, and calls on the Minister for Tourism, Culture and 
            Sport to work with the Minister for Finance and Public Services in 
            order to find funding to assist the cash-strapped team.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1451</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> 
            <strong>Heart Week 5 to 13 June 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates the British Heart Foundation on its Heart Week campaign, 
            the Big Red Fightback, from 5 to 13 June 2004, against coronary heart 
            disease (CHD); notes that, while heart disease rates in Scotland are 
            falling, more people than ever before are living with the disease; 
            further notes that lack of physical activity is one of the key causes 
            of CHD, yet only around one in three men and one in four women achieves 
            the recommended 30 minutes of exercise, five times a week, and therefore 
            believes that the Heart Week campaign's focus on encouraging people 
            to increase their level of physical exercise will be an important 
            contribution to fighting the causes of heart disease in Scotland.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1450#</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>NHS 
            Argyll and Clyde's Clinical Strategy Review</strong>-That the Parliament 
            rejects the inadequate and short-sighted proposals expressed in <em>Shaping 
            the Future</em>, the clinical strategy for NHS Argyll and Clyde, and 
            specifically its proposals to close both the Dumbarton Joint Hospital 
            and the Helensburgh Victoria Infirmary and to further downgrade the 
            Vale of Leven Hospital while centralising services at the Royal Alexandra 
            Hospital (RAH) in Paisley; notes that, in a recent consultation held 
            by Jackie Baillie MSP and John McFall MP with nurses, consultants, 
            voluntary groups and the local community, 88% of those who responded 
            said that they wanted services delivered north of the river Clyde; 
            agrees that travelling long journeys to reach suitable health care 
            should be the exception and not the rule; further notes with concern 
            the apparent lack of detailed regional planning in arriving at these 
            proposals, and therefore considers that these proposals should be 
            rejected and that local services should be maximised as the first 
            priority and thereafter, for those services that cannot be delivered 
            locally, that serious consideration should be given to the use of 
            Gartnavel Hospital and the Golden Jubilee Hospital.</P>

            Scotland's Right for Nurses, Right for Patients Campaign</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the recent launch of the Royal College of Nursing 
            Scotland's Right for Nurses, Right for Patients campaign that aims 
            to focus attention on five key nursing issues, including staffing 
            levels and workload, pay modernisation, professional development, 
            specialist nurses and nurse leadership; welcomes the Scottish Executive's 
            positive response to the <em>Facing the Future Nursing and Midwifery 
            Workload and Workforce Planning Project </em>report in accepting all 
            of its 20 recommendations, and further welcomes the forthcoming Facing 
            the Future national convention on Monday 28 June 2004 in Edinburgh 
            and the opportunity it presents for nurses across Scotland to influence 
            future policy on nursing.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1448</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>NHS

            which proposes to move in-patient and emergency services from Inverclyde 
            Royal Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH) in Paisley; expresses 
            concern that the RAH, which is already struggling to cope with the 
            increased numbers of patients that it is required to treat as a result 
            of previous centralisation exercises, will be even more severely stretched; 
            condemns the denial of access to NHS services for people in Inverclyde, 
            Largs, Dunoon and beyond, and calls on the NHS board to consider alternative 
            options which may be brought forward for dealing with the real external

            of Standing Orders</em> (SP Paper 93), and its 5th Report, 2004 (Session

            have very few pleasures in life and one of them they regard as smoking&quot;; 
            notes that the people Dr Reid speaks of are those most at risk of 
            dying of smoking-related illnesses; considers these remarks to be 
            ill-judged and dangerous and also that these comments are unhelpful 
            to the Scottish Executive's proclaimed strategy to cut smoking levels 
            among all categories in society, and urges its members to make it 
            clear that the health of those in the lower socio-economic groups 
            is equally as important as those in other socio-economic categories 
            and support speedy legislation to get anti-smoking legislation on

            achievement but that the exploitation and abuse of workers' rights 
            endemic in the sportswear industry is violating that Olympic spirit; 
            notes that a recent report by Play Fair has found that employees of 
            international corporate sportswear companies are working long hours 
            for low wages in arduous conditions, often without the most basic 
            employment protection; commends the work of the Play Fair at the Olympics 
            campaign, which is attempting to persuade sportswear companies and 
            the International Olympic Committee to take their responsibilities 
            seriously and challenge the abusive business practices of its sponsors 
            and licensees, and believes that the Scottish Executive should pledge 
            its support for this campaign and help place pressure upon the Olympic 
            movement to become part of the solution to end such labour abuses.</P>

            links to Al-Qa'ida and Iraq posing an imminent &quot;45-minute&quot; 
            danger to British interests; believes that the invasion of Iraq was 
            illegal under international law and the continued presence of coalition 
            troops represents an illegal occupation of a sovereign country; believes 
            that the United Nations was wrong to support the bombing of Afghanistan 
            and that its regrettable inability to prevent the invasion of Iraq 
            exposes its inherent weakness in relation to US domination of our
