          <p><strong>*S1M-2391</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Recent Alleged 
            Comments by Sheriff Ronald Smith on Peace Protestors</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament condemns the alleged comments of Sheriff Ronald Smith 
            at Dumbarton Sheriff Court referring to peace protestors as parasites, 
            causing untold damage to fences, disrupting the Faslane base and wasting 
            public money which could be spent elsewhere, believes that such comments 
            are unacceptable from a practising Sheriff and expose political bias, 
            ignorance and intolerance of legitimate peaceful protest, and further 
            believes that such comments would render a Sheriff unfit to sit in 
            judgement impartially in any case involving peace protestors, if at 
            all.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2390 Mr Tom McCabe on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Business Motion</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that time 
            for consideration of Stages 2 and 3 of the Police and Fire Services 
            (Finance) (Scotland) Bill be allocated as follows, so that debate 
            on proceedings at each Stage, if not previously brought to a conclusion, 
            shall be brought to a conclusion at the time specified &#150;</p>
          <p></p>

          <p></p>
          <p>Stage 3 &#150; no later than 5.00 pm </p>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2389</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Centrally Held 
            Information</strong>&#151;That the Parliament denounces the unhelpful and 
            often overused answer to parliamentary questions by the Scottish Executive 
            that &quot;This information is not held centrally&quot; and urges 
            the Executive to provide its departments with the means of gathering 
            the information necessary to ensure that answers to parliamentary 
            questions are substantive. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong>, Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, 
            Alex Neil<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2388#</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Son-Rise Program</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament acknowledges the Son-Rise Program in Massachusetts, 
            USA, and its unique approach to autism; recognises the programme&#146;s 
            remarkable and successful results as shown by Edinburgh parent Sue 
            McLernon, her daughter Danielle and son Sean, and believes that the 
            Scottish Executive should finance and resource similar projects throughout 
            Scotland in order to ensure that autistic children and adults receive 
            the greatest possible care and education available that is specific 
            to their individual needs.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2387</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: The Charter 
            for Equality and Diversity in Ageing</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            <a name="MotionText">welcomes the launch of the Charter for Equality 
            and Diversity in Ageing which calls upon public bodies and service 
            providers to take positive steps to improve the quality of life for 
            all older people in Scotland and to promote positive attitudes to 
            equality and diversity in ageing across all services and sections 
            of the community; recognises the work of Age Concern Scotland, the 
            Black and Minority Ethnic Elders Group and other organisations which 
            have made the charter possible, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to give whatever help is necessary to support the aims of the charter.
