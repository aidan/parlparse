          <p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by 
            the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information 
            to the Parliament.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>S1W-23641</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-15753 
            by Mr Jim Wallace on 11 July 2001, whether it supports the use by 
            the Scottish Law Commission in paragraph 1.5 of its <em>Report on Boundary 
            Division Walls </em>(footnote 7) of the Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia 
            (Volume 18, paragraph 223) to justify the Commission's opinion that 
            the law on March Fence Type Divisions had been changed from ownership 
            &#145;pro-indiviso&#146; to ownership to mid-line only (&quot;ad medium 
            filum&quot;) when at the time of publication of this Encyclopaedia 
            in 1993 the Commission itself (a) had in a letter to Mr David Lambie 
            MP in October 1990 stated that research commissioned by itself had 
            shown that case law on the subject was confused, consisting of essentially 
            two lines of decision which cannot be satisfactorily reconciled, (b) 
            had issued in June 1992 a consultation paper on Mutual Boundary Walls 
            which confirmed this confusion in this aspect of the law but suggested 
            that holding as &#145;pro-indiviso&#146; common property should be 
            confirmed and asking inter alia whether legislation to clarify and 
            settle the matter was required, (c) stated that the matter was still 
            open and under consideration, including the consultee responses, when 
            the Encyclopaedia was published in 1993 and (d) issued in December 
            1990, a discussion paper (No.91) on the law of the tenement in which 
            the proposals supported the use of &#145;pro-indiviso&#146; common 
            property for walls dividing property ownership, which in the Commission&#146;s 
            own words &#145;met with general support from consultees&#146;.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-23642</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether Professor KGC Reid was a member of 
            the Scottish Law Commission at the time the Commission published its 
            <em>Report on Boundary Division Walls</em> in March 1998 and, if so, 
            whether he had been a member for three years and whether paragraph 
            223 in Volume 18 of the Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia on 'Ownership 
            and Maintenance' as published in 1993 was compiled by him while he 
            was a member of the Commission.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-23643</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether there was a team of three Commissioners 
            in operation prior to the publication of the Scottish Law Commission's<em> 
            Report on Boundary Division Walls</em>, which was responsible for property 
            considerations and, if so, for how long this team was in operation 
            and whether Professor KGC Reid was a member of it.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-23644</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it supports the statement in the Stair 
            Memorial Encyclopaedia (Volume 18, paragraph 223) that &quot;the modern 
            law is not now in doubt&quot;; whether, at the time of the Encyclopaedia's 
            publication, the Scottish Law Commission was expressing and demonstrating 
            that doubt existed and was promoting a view in direct conflict with 
            this statement and whether the author of this paragraph was aware 
            of the Commission&#146;s position at the time.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-23645</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to Question S1W-15753 
            by Mr Jim Wallace on 11 July 2001, whether it supports the change 
            of mind by the Scottish Law Commission, as stated at paragraph 1.13 
            of their<em> Report on Boundary Division Walls</em>; on what basis this 
            change of mind came about; what reconsideration was given to the Commission's 
            consultation paper and the Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia on this issue; 
            what importance can be attached to the change of Commissioners at 
            the Commission, and what plans it has to ensure that a clear, consistent 
            and uniform policy on this matter is adopted and maintained.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-23664</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how many planning applications have been referred

            constituency.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-23665</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> To ask

          <p><strong>S1W-23667</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what powers it has in respect of Crown Estates 
            property and whether it will seek additional powers from Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government, with particular regard to fish farms.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-23668</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it has any (a) powers and (b) plans 
            to give financial relief to fish farms in respect of rents charged 
            by the Crown Estates Commissioners and what information it has received 
            on any such charges collected in other countries for the purposes 
            of assessing their impact on the fish farming industry in Scotland. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>S1W-23669</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it will ensure that no vision and strategy 
            papers and detailed and outline policy proposals on devolved topics 
            will be issued between 31 December 2002 and 1 May 2003 except in circumstances

          <p><strong>S1W-23670</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> To ask

          <p><strong>S1W-23671</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> To ask

            papers between 31 December 2002 and 1 May 2003.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-23672</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive, in view of its responsibility for economic 
            development, what estimate it has made of any increase in the volume 
            of quarrying by-products, such as dust, which will be unsaleable in 
            circumstances where such by-products are replaced in construction 
            projects with other materials which are not subject to the aggregates 
            tax and what the consequent loss will be to Scotland's gross domestic

            and value of public construction projects for which it, its agencies 
            and other public bodies are responsible as a result of the introduction 
            of the aggregates tax.</p>

            ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to mitigate any

            ask the Scottish Executive what information it has received from Her

            both in Glasgow and throughout Scotland&quot; in the October 2001 
            issue of <em>The Key - Special Edition for Home Owners</em>, whether

            the Scottish Executive whether the ballot on the Glasgow housing stock 
            transfer will be underway before the second stage consultation is

            vacancies arising from construction industry shortages following the 
            transfer of Glasgow City Council&#146;s housing stock, in light of 
            research commissioned by the council, Scottish Enterprise Glasgow

          <p><strong>S1W-23693</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> To ask

            the Scottish Executive whether the forthcoming ballot on the transfer

          <p><strong>S1W-23695</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, if tenants choose to vote against stock transfer

          <p><strong>S1W-23697</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that an anomaly has

            for new graduates which affects the 2-year probation of graduates
