<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-628</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>End Discrimination by Utilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuation of the practice by utility companies of surcharging those who do not pay by direct debit; believes that this surcharge is a tax on older people and those with low incomes, and calls on these companies to introduce a system that does not discriminate against those who choose to pay by cash.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-627</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>European Shark Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that European Shark Week runs from 8 to 14 October 2007; condemns the practice of shark finning which sees sharks hauled on board ships to have their fins removed before being thrown back into the water, often still alive; notes that, although this practice has been illegal for European fishermen since 2003, the current legislation contains many loopholes and is not being properly enforced or monitored in all EU countries; further notes that many species, such as the hammerhead shark, are now on the endangered list as a result of finning; recognises the vital role that sharks play in the marine ecology, and calls on the European Union to put a stop to this cruel, unnecessary and wasteful practice.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-626</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Football Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen Football Club on qualifying for the group stages of the UEFA Cup; looks forward to the economic and sporting benefits that will follow, and calls on the Scottish Ministers and sportscotland to ensure continued support for sports development in Aberdeen and the north east to the benefit of Scotland as a whole.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Foulkes<strong>*</strong>, John Park<strong>*</strong>, Charlie Gordon<strong>*</strong>, Patricia Ferguson<strong>*</strong>, Richard Baker<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-625</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Class Sizes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Scottish Government for its commitment to reducing class sizes to 18 in primary 1 to primary 3; notes that there are cost implications in delivering this policy not only in terms of additional staff but, in circumstances where popular schools are full to capacity, also in the need for building modifications; is aware that, while teachers strive for smaller classes, ensuring that one&rsquo;s children access the school of their choice is often a parent&rsquo;s first consideration; recognises that in some open-plan classrooms up to 66 children are in a class served by two teachers; believes that building constraints can be overcome and children&rsquo;s educational experience greatly enhanced by considering the employment of two teachers in a class of 33 (36 if there is space), rather than a teacher and an occasional classroom assistant, and is also of the view that raising the starting age for primary school, in line with standard practice in Germany, Scandinavia and elsewhere, would not only be sound education policy, but would also allow for smaller class sizes and should be explored by the Scottish Government.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-624</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Moray Citizens Advice Bureau</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Moray Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) on its successful year of service to the people of Moray; praises the 17 volunteer advisers, paid staff and management committee, who make an extremely valuable contribution to the work of Moray CAB which provides a comprehensive advice and information service to the Moray community, and wishes Moray CAB every success for the next 12 months and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-623</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>International Credit Union Day - Together We&rsquo;re Better</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish credit union movement on its continued growth, both in total membership and assets; acknowledges its positive support for financial inclusion in communities across the country; notes that on International Credit Union Day, Thursday 18 October 2007, 200 million credit union members around the world will join in celebration under the theme, Together We&rsquo;re Better, and congratulates the Scottish League of Credit Unions on honouring the memory of the late Bert Mullen, founder of Scotland&rsquo;s first credit union in Drumchapel in 1970, at the Biennial Bert Mullen Lecture, &quot;Building Confidence - the Role of Credit Unions&quot;, to be delivered at the University of Glasgow by Dr Carol Craig.</p>
