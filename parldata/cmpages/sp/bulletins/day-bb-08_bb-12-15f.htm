<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3104</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Walk Don&rsquo;t Run</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the claims of the Communication Workers Union that Royal Mail management are expecting postal workers to walk their routes at an average speed of 4 mph, instead of the long-established expectation of 2.4 mph; believes that this is an obvious attempt at further cost cutting that will simply lead to increased work-related injury among staff, further reducing the morale of an already beleaguered workforce, and asks Royal Mail management to stop this cost-cutting exercise.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3103</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Keep Trade Local this Christmas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland on its Keep Trade Local &ndash; Sustaining Scottish Communities campaign; recognises the contribution of small independent businesses not simply to the local economy but also to the wider community, and encourages MSPs to back their local traders in the current economic difficulties and source their Christmas dinners from small, independent businesses in their constituencies.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3102</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to East Renfrewshire for Being the Best-performing Local Authority for Exam Performance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates East Renfrewshire on being the top-performing local authority in exam results, with 27% of its pupils passing five or more highers and 47% passing three or more; notes that St Ninian&rsquo;s High School was the second-best performing state-funded school, with 37% of its pupils passing five highers or more, and further notes that a total of five schools from East Renfrewshire are included in the list of top-performing schools.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3101</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Tram Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that Edinburgh&rsquo;s Princes Street, Scotland&rsquo;s most famous street, will be closed for eight months in order to commence track-laying work for the Edinburgh Tram Project; further believes that the disruption will affect businesses, motorists and pedestrians, increasing frustration in the city, all to put in place a project forced through by Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems essentially to replace the exceptional number 22 bus service while leaving behind a black hole for Edinburgh&rsquo;s residents to pay, and nevertheless asks Transport Initiatives Edinburgh to ensure the lowest possible level of disruption to the city and its residents.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>

<p><strong>S3M-3094</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Scotland at Ten</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets BBC Scotland&rsquo;s decision to stop producing Scotland at Ten in its current format; expresses concern that the new format represents a lowering of standards in relation to current affairs production as there will not be live discussion in the new format; believes that Scotland at Ten has been an important feature of current affairs in Scotland for Scots who want to be more informed about Scottish politics and Scottish affairs, and urges BBC Scotland to reconsider its decision.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3092&diams;</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Protection for Buyers of New-build Homes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that in 2007 Helen Eadie MSP submitted a proposal for a Member&rsquo;s Bill, which would require a builder and a developer of a new-build home in Scotland to specify an entry date in the missives for the sale of that property and, if that entry date were missed, to enable buyers of that property to withdraw from the contract without penalty and to have returned to them any deposit or fees paid in advance together with interest and provide for compensation for delays should the purchaser wish still to continue with the contract; recognises that such delays were experienced by an individual in Kingseat who was forced to pay over &pound;4,000 in additional costs for living expenses, shelter and storage pending completion of his home and that similar experiences of high costs have been documented throughout Scotland; regrets that the Minister for Communities and Sport has yet to agree a date for a meeting on this issue or respond to the substantive issues around housing strategy raised during Health and Wellbeing question time on 26 June 2008 (<em>Official Report</em>, c. 10290); hopes that the Scottish Government will clarify whether it will support a proposed legislative change and examine the Court of Appeal decision of R (Khatun) v Newham LBC [2004] EWCA Civ 55, [2005] QB 37, which held that contracts relating to land are not within the scope of Council Directive 93/13/EEC and regulations; acknowledges that while C7 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 reserves those matters specified in that section (consumer protection) to Westminster, in this instance the Court of Appeal decision held that contracts or missives relating to land were not within the scope of the Directive or the Regulations, and considers that legislative changes proposed by Helen Eadie MSP, which will offer protection to home purchasers who currently have, according to the Scottish Consumer Council, more protection buying a video than buying a house, are worthy of support.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3091</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Pending Decision of the Office of Rail Regulation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the pending decision of the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) on the planned expansion of rail services on the east coast main line between London and Scotland; recognises that there are competing applications for scarce track capacity on sections of the east coast route; understands that new services that publicly-franchised inter city east coast service operator National Express East Coast has offered to run from December 2009 include additional services to Scotland, that the additional services will deliver much-needed extra capacity of thousands of extra seats per day and create around 50 new jobs, a number of which are likely to be in Scotland, and that the proposed new timetable will significantly reduce average journey times between London and Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scotland Office and Scottish Government ministers to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s interests are effectively communicated to ORR and taken into account by them in allocating any available capacity.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3090</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>The Act of Settlement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the fact that Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice Jack Straw MP is looking to change the Act of Settlement 1701; strongly believes that it is wrong to have a settled constitutional position that discriminates against any section of the population, and further believes that the Act is outdated and does not fit with multicultural life in a modern society.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3087</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper&rsquo;s Threat to Lone Parents of Very Young Children and Disabled People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at proposals contained in the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper, <em>Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future</em>, to push lone parents of very young children and disabled people into taking mandatory steps toward work that is not necessarily available in a time of economic turndown, which it believes is the result of the economic incompetence of the UK Government; further believes that this represents bullying tactics against vulnerable groups and individuals, and considers that suggestions that schemes be piloted in Glasgow effectively amounts to test-bedding Glasgow in the same way as Scotland was test-bedded for the Poll Tax by the Thatcher government.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3085</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Save Our Forests</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposal to lease 25% of the most commercially viable, publicly-owned Scottish forests to private investment companies for up to 75 years; further notes that the 25% could equate to 40% of production for the Forestry Commission, which could significantly diminish essential income for investment in maintaining tourist activities such as the 7stanes network and for creating new leisure-access initiatives such as mountain biking, walking, orienteering and other community woodland projects; recognises the importance of Scotland&rsquo;s woods and forests and the potential for raising capital for expansion of woodland cover; considers that Forestry Commission jobs and associated jobs are under threat; recognises that timber and wood processing companies depend on security of wood supply and that Forestry Commission cutting contracts face an uncertain future if those cutting rights are taken away; urges the Scottish Government to commit to maintaining sufficient availability of wood for these industries; considers that the Scottish Government should commission a comprehensive survey of wood availability and demand, in conjunction with Forestry Commission Scotland, Forestry Commission Wales and Forestry Commission England and with the wood industries; recognises with concern the detrimental effects that this proposal could have on the Scottish landscape, economy and environment, and calls for its immediate withdrawal from the Scottish Climate Change Bill.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3084</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>School Budget Cuts Must Stop</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the creation of the Edinburgh Parent Council Network, a first class framework for parent councils across Edinburgh to support each other in their work; congratulates the network on its first publication, a dossier detailing the very concerning impact that a 1.5% efficiency saving has had on school budgets this financial year and outlining just how the proposed 2% efficiency saving would devastate each school&rsquo;s budget next year; calls on the Lib Dem/SNP council to abandon its plans for a 2% budget cut; reminds John Swinney MSP of his words in the Chamber on 20 November 2008 (<em>Official Report</em>, c. 12632) when he said &quot;What might be described as crude cuts in services can in no way pass the test for efficiency savings&quot;, and believes that the SNP government&rsquo;s historic concordat is failing Scotland&rsquo;s children.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3057</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Scots Trad Music Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the winners of the Scots Trad Music Awards 2008; notes that the keen competition for each of the awards is a clear sign of the strength in depth of traditional music across Scotland; particularly notes that Orkney musicians have once again come to the fore with three winners, Kris Drever as Instrumentalist of the Year, The Chair as Scottish Folk Band of the Year and Jeana Leslie and Siobhan Miller as the Up and Coming Artists of the Year; believes that this is a fair reflection of Orkney&rsquo;s strength in the field of traditional music, with both established and young musicians maintaining and building Orkney&rsquo;s musical reputation; looks forward to next year&rsquo;s Orkney Folk Festival, and recommends that visitors from across Scotland and around the world visit Orkney to hear for themselves the music played on the islands where it has its roots.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2878#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Dignity for Palestinians</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the passage of the boat, Dignity, which travelled from Cyprus to Gaza with 11 European parliamentarians including three members of the Scottish Parliament on board; recognises that this is the third boat to challenge the siege of Gaza, which has become a permanent blockade and which has affected every aspect of Palestinian life to the point where they are now in receipt of the largest food aid programme in the world; is concerned about the impact of the blockade on ordinary Palestinians, denying them basic health care rights as there is a shortage of medicine, proper medical equipment and severe restrictions on leaving Gaza for referral treatment, which has resulted in many deaths as recorded by the World Health Organisation; supports the efforts of Edinburgh Direct Aid to send aid to Gaza, and recognises that action by the international community, to secure an end to the siege of Gaza and implement international law, is key to encouraging long-term peace in the Middle East.</p>
