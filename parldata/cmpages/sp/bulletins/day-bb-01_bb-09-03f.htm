            the Scottish Executive acted when the illegitimacy of Erskine Bridge 
            tolls was discovered; further notes the doubt about the legal legitimacy 
            of Skye Bridge tolls, and urges the Scottish Executive to make public 
            all legislative and contractual documentation pertaining to the collection 
            of tolls on the Skye Bridge.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2150</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: <i>Tampa </i>Refugees</strong>&#151;That

            refusing to allow the asylum seekers on board the boat <i>Tampa</i> 
            off Christmas Island to land in Australia; believes that this behaviour 
            contravenes all standards of humanity, and calls upon the Australian 
            Government to reverse this inhumane policy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2149 Mr Tom McCabe on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: 
            Committee Membership</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that the

          <p>Margaret Ewing to replace Christine Grahame on the Justice 2 Committee,</p>

            Committee. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2148</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry: Scottish Examination System</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the substantial progress made in relation to 
            the Scottish examination process; congratulates everyone involved 
            &#150; the pupils on their achievements, the teachers on their efforts 
            in helping to make the system work, the Scottish Qualifications Authority 
            (SQA) on the improvements introduced, and the Scottish Executive on 
            its commitment to ensuring a smooth process and providing the investment 
            to make the system work; notes that further investigation is required 
            to refine and improve both the examination process and the workings 
            of the SQA, and asks that the Scottish Executive undertake an early 
            review of both the SQA and the structure of the examinations, including 
            internal assessments.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2147#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Refugee Ship</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament commends the people of East Timor for their humanitarian 
            action in offering sanctuary to the boat refugees refused permission 
            to land by the Australian Government and congratulates this newly 
            emerging independent democracy on its ready acceptance of international 
            responsibility.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2146</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Borders Timber and Holyrood</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament, in the spirit of Enric Miralles&#146; wish to incorporate 
            traditional Scottish materials in the Holyrood parliament and in recognition 
            of the historic importance of Borders timber and of its present day 
            craftsmen and women, recommends the use of Borders-made furniture 
            within that building and its environs. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2145</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Community Policing in Fife</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates Fife Constabulary on its record on community 
            policing, as highlighted in a report published by HM Chief Inspector 
            of Constabulary, and notes in particular Fife&#146;s emphasis on preventative 
            work, focus on priority issues such as drugs and lay visitors scheme.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Brian Monteith<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2144</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Testing in the 5-14 Curriculum</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the proposals of the Scottish Executive to develop 
            revised, standardised tests for primary school pupils in the areas 
            of literacy and numeracy as part of the 5-14 curriculum and believes 
            that these tests should be undertaken in all Scottish schools to provide 
            valuable comparative and individualised information for parents, teachers 
            and pupils.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2143</strong> <strong>Angus MacKay: Sexual Offences (Procedure and 
            Evidence) (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the Sexual Offences (Procedure and Evidence) (Scotland) 
            Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure payable out of the Scottish 
            Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace<strong>*</strong>, Iain Gray<strong>*</strong>, Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2142#</strong> <strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing: Inverness Airport and Links 
            with Hub Airports</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the huge 
            significance of direct links between Inverness Airport and London 
            hub airports to the economic and social well-being of the Highlands 
            and Islands, particularly in relation to tourism, exports, the business 
            economy and employment; expresses its grave concern at the possible 
            loss of landing slots at Gatwick; seeks not only to have such links 
            preserved but also to have similar slots at Heathrow restored, and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should pursue these matters vigorously 
            with the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions 
            and the European Commission.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2141</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Scottish Parliament 
            Police Unit</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to reimburse Lothian and Borders Police for the full annual cost of 
            running the Scottish Parliament Police Unit, instead of the current 
            39 week basis of reimbursement which will result in a funding deficit 
            of £111,436 in the current financial year, as the costs of policing 
            the Parliament should be borne centrally and not at the expense of 
            one region of the country.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David McLetchie<strong>*</strong>, Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong>, Linda 
            Fabiani<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2140#</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Primary Health Care in Rural 
            Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses grave concern over 
            the increasing centralisation of many health care services, currently 
            provided efficiently and effectively within the primary care sector, 
            into large central units primarily concerned with expensive acute 
            care provision; notes the uncertainty surrounding Chalmers Hospital 
            in Banff as an example of the threat to such services, and believes 
            that the Executive should review policy direction to NHS boards in 
            order to emphasise that community facilities must always be the preferred 
            option.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Brian Adam<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2139</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe</strong> <strong>on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau</strong>:<strong> Business Motion</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees

            airport, high quality and wide ranging education and training infrastructure 
            and an outstanding environment enhanced by a recent £40 million investment 
            to clean up its seafront, as well as a rich heritage, not least in

            City Council acted against the occupation of Govanhill Pool; deplores 
            the council's decision to send in sheriff officers and police against 
            what had been a peaceful protest for 140 days; notes that the council 
            was entirely responsible for the police being called in; believes 
            that no council should involve the police in purely political matters 
            such as this, and asks Glasgow City Council to provide an explanation 
            for its specific acts of provocation, which included ignoring pleas 
            to alleviate the situation which would have avoided the charge by 
            mounted police, a lack of regard for the safety of either police or 
            demonstrators, a failure to send any positive message that they would 
            even talk to the pool protesters and abandoning the police and public 
            to face the consequences of its decisions, as well as for the further 
            acts which re-started trouble, such as sending workmen to board up 
            the swimming pool in front of demonstrators and, next day, refusing 
            to let the Southside Against Closures group into a council-run hall 
            to hold a peaceful meeting and closing Govanhill Neighbourhood Centre 
            to everyone, including local sports groups which usually use the facility,

            the Parliament believes that any move at Westminster to implement 
            the provision in the Scotland Act 1998 which would cut the number 
            of MSPs from 129 would be severely damaging to Scottish democracy, 
            given that 129 is the smallest number of seats that allows any effective 
            proportionality of seats arising from votes cast; further believes 
            that any reduction in the number of members would adversely affect 
            the committee system of the Parliament which after two years is proving 
            itself to be effective and efficient; believes that such a crucial 
            decision for the future of Scotland and its democratic institutions 
            would be better made by this Parliament rather than Westminster, and 
            therefore calls upon the Parliamentary Bureau to establish a special 
            committee to prepare an urgent all-party and unanimous submission 
            to Her Majesty's Government demanding the retention of the present

            of the export ban imposed as a result of foot-and-mouth disease; believes

            in Europe by the Scottish Executive; regrets that the Scottish Executive 
            has made no direct representations to the European Commission thus 
            far; urges the Scottish Executive to take charge of the negotiations 
            with both the European Commission and the Standing Veterinary Committee 
            in order to secure the objective of lifting the ban, and believes

            consequences this will have for health services in the region; notes 
            that Grampian has the lowest per capita health funding in Scotland 
            and is concerned that this will continue to be the position in 2004; 
            believes that this situation is a result of the inadequacy of the 
            Arbuthnott formula at identifying the financial needs of health boards 
            with large rural populations, and therefore believes that the operation 
            of the formula should be reviewed to ensure that finance is allocated

            on 1 August 2001 authorised, by a majority vote, further cuts of £1,579,255 
            to its education budget; notes that £200,000 was previously cut from 
            the budget for the provision of special education auxiliaries; is 
            concerned that part of these further cuts will impact on the provision 
            of transport for children with special needs and that the intention 
            to vire £525,000 from the Excellence Fund budget to the National Grid 
            for Learning budget will impact directly on special education needs 
            provision by raiding the budget for classroom assistants, early intervention 
            and learning support; believes that this matter is causing undue distress 
            and uncertainty to parents of children with special educational needs;

          <p><strong>S1M-2088#</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Waste Incinerators</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with concern that at least five large new incinerators 
            are being planned for siting around Scotland, despite the growing 
            evidence that they may frequently emit a cocktail of toxic chemicals 
            which breach legal pollution limits and raise health concerns; further 
            notes that the defect ridden Baldovie incinerator in Dundee reported 
            18 separate breaches of safety limits within a five week period earlier 
            this year, which more than justifies the concerns of communities in 
            Aberdeen about the planned Altens incinerator; is concerned that although 
            60% of the waste produced in Scotland is biodegradable, only 6.6% 
            of it was recycled last year, thereby placing Scotland at the bottom 
            of the European recycling league; commends the first area waste plan 
            in Scotland which opts for the recycling of waste rather than the 
            burning of it, and believes that the Scottish Executive should implement 
            policies which promote a resource efficient, recycling society.</p>

            money to fund a party which is attacking our jobs, wages and conditions; 
            Conference also notes that the New Labour policies have led significant

            candidates in favour of independents or other candidates who oppose 
            cuts and privatisation and defend public services; this Conference

            therefore instructs the National Executive Council to consult the 
            affiliated and general political fund committees, service groups,

            payments such as benefits, redundancy payments and pensions are not 
            exempt from the application of bank arrestments and that many arrestments 
            are enacted without warning; notes with alarm that the overall impact 
            of such bank arrestments is financial hardship, particularly for families 
            with children; fears that the abolition of poindings and warrant sales

            for around 91% of such arrestments, is within the competence of the

            Baillie on 14 June 2001 stated that there were, for the year 1999-2000, 
            1,672 very sheltered houses for older people in the social rented 
            sector; further notes that based on the latest research available 
            the requirement for very sheltered accommodation for older people 
            is 23 dwellings per 1,000 of the older population; acknowledges that 
            Age Concern estimates a requirement in the order of 18,055 such dwellings, 
            and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should immediately 
            commission a report to confirm very sheltered housing requirements 
            and undertake that the report will be published within the next parliamentary 
            year.</p>

            over 160 Scottish lives were saved or markedly improved by a transplant; 
            notes that over the next decade the number of people developing kidney

            transplantation is the most cost-effective solution for suitable patients

            clubs, medical and children&#146;s charities which supports the campaign

            oldest national flag in the world, varies in shade ranging from light 
            blue through dark blue to navy; disputes the argument that the Executive 
            cannot take a view on this matter on the grounds that heraldic responsibility 
            lies with Westminster, since the Lord Lyon King of Arms has been in 
            charge for many centuries of all aspects of heraldry in Scotland; 
            believes that the relevance of heraldry to national flags is questionable 
            not least because there is no heraldic definition of colours, which 
            is why many countries define the colours of their national flag in 
            law; and believes that the Executive should acknowledge that it is 
            entirely appropriate for any modern Parliament to take a view on the 
            proper colour of its national flag and that a legal definition of 
            the Saltire&#146;s colours would be welcomed.</p>

            Works, has been forced into a series of cost cutting exercises and 
            staff redundancies because of continuing decline in the Scottish tourism 
            market and a critical shortfall in revenue support; further notes 
            that the Trust has warned that unless significant additional revenue 
            support can be found it will consider the closure of Verdant Works, 
            the last working jute mill in Scotland and the 1999 European Industrial 
            Museum of the Year, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to provide emergency funding to secure the jobs of the 43 staff employed 
            by Dundee Heritage Trust across three sites in the city and, in the 
            longer term, to extend central revenue support in partnership with 
            local authority support to avoid a huge loss, not just to the city

            the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Parliamentary Bureau

            Advice Scotland&#146;s Quarterly Social Policy Briefing, identifies 
            social security benefits as the biggest category of problems dealt 
            with by bureaux, with 133,272 enquiries; further notes that, of these, 
            disability benefits amounted to 20,244 enquiries, income support 16,524 
            and housing benefit 12,274; recognises that disability benefits are 
            a particular concern because of the complexity of the form and because 
            decisions are sometimes contradictory, leading to some entitlements 
            being removed altogether; notes that applicants may be charged up 
            to £40 by their GP for a medical assessment; notes that the complexity 
            of the application system is evidenced by the 10,510 repeat enquiries 
            which bureaux dealt with in this area; commends the citizens advice 
            service on representing 638 clients at disability appeals tribunals, 
            two thirds of which had positive outcomes, and urges the Scottish

            is aware that Scottish dairy farmers produce milk to among the highest 
            standards in the world; is disgusted that PETA should play on the 
            fears and insecurities of children in pursuit of their goals; notes 
            that the claims made by PETA against milk and dairy products are totally 
            without foundation; is aware that a diet which includes milk and dairy 
            products is greatly beneficial to young people as a source of calcium, 
            energy and protein, and believes that this issue provides the Scottish

            the way that babies are positioned for sleep has helped reduce cot 
            deaths in Scotland by 60%; is concerned by the link between cigarette 
            smoke and cot death, with an estimated seven-fold increase in risk 
            for infants of women who smoke during pregnancy; further notes the 
            Cot Death Trust&#146;s warning that the 100% increase in 15-year-old 
            girls smoking in the past 10 years could result in an alarming rise 
            in the number of cot deaths, and therefore welcomes the Scottish Cot 
            Death Trust's research at the Queen Mother's Hospital Glasgow to determine 
            whether innovative motivational counselling offered to pregnant women 
            will be more successful than traditional advice in helping these women

            Security has made it clear that people with myalgic encephalomyelitis 
            (ME) are entitled to state benefits, the format of questions on the 
            claim forms and the nature of the tests for disability are not appropriate 
            to the symptoms and consequences of this disease; further notes that 
            many of those with ME have difficulty in obtaining benefits to which 
            they are entitled, and believes that the Scottish Executive, through 
            its representatives on the UK Working Group on ME established in 1999, 
            should emphasise these difficulties in order that no-one who is disabled 
            through ME is excluded from accessing appropriate benefits.</p>

            secondary schools no longer have access to a grass playing field and 
            that, despite government promises to promote sport, there is evidence 
            of a serious long-term decline in the facilities available, almost 
            40% of schools do not have a football pitch and there is real concern 
            also about community facilities which are closing down because of 
            a lack of resources to maintain them; considers that this situation 
            means that the already high obesity rate among young Scots will continue 
            to rise in the future and that the nation&#146;s performance in the 
            world sporting arena will go into irreversible decline, and therefore

          <p><strong>S1M-1764#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Flood Prevention</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the responsibility which local authorities have 
            for flood prevention measures and also the need for them to give consideration 
            to possible flood risks when considering planning applications; further 
            notes that local authorities have access to estimated 100 year flood 
            maps provided by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for this 
            purpose but is concerned that the scale of these maps, produced by 
            the Institute of Hydrology, is 1:50,000 and that they only provide 
            information in 50 square metre blocks; urges the Scottish Executive 
            to give consideration to the effectiveness of these maps; believes 
            that the Executive should work with all local authorities to identify 
            areas of flood risk which are susceptible to flooding and to develop 
            a national scheme to restrict or prohibit development on &quot;at 
            risk&quot; areas, and further urges the Executive to produce a long 
            term strategy for areas of development currently prone to flooding.</p>

            the Parliament, in view of 2001 being the Year of the Severely Affected 
            with ME and in view of ME Awareness Week in May 2001, acknowledges 
            the suffering of an estimated fifteen thousand patients with myalgic 
            encephalomyelitis (ME) and/or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) including 
            an estimated two and a half thousand children, and asks the Scottish 
            Executive to commission urgently a strategic needs review assessment 
            into ME and CFS and to set up a specialist ME and CFS clinic for diagnosis 
            and treatment of sufferers.</p>

            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes that a quarter of all Scots 
            will suffer from mental illness at some point in their lives; believes 
            that recovery, treatment and acceptability of mental illness are severely 
            hindered by its negative and taboo image and by public ignorance, 
            and considers that the best way to combat the stigma surrounding mental 
            illness is to introduce a high profile anti-stigma and public education 
            campaign such as the People Too campaign launched this month by the 
            Scottish Association for Mental Health, Penumbra, National Schizophrenia 
            Fellowship and The Royal College of Psychiatrists.</a></p>
