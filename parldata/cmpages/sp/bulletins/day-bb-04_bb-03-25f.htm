          <p><strong>*S2M-1098</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead on behalf of 
            the European and External Relations Committee:</strong> <strong>Enlargement 
            of the European Union</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the enlargement 
            of the European Union that will see 10 new member states join on 1 
            May 2004; recognises that this provides both challenges and opportunities 
            to Scotland, and encourages the Scottish Executive to promote actively 
            the benefits of enlargement across Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1097</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Man's 
            Inhumanity to Man</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the launch 
            and display of the exhibition &quot;Crying Forever&quot; within the 
            Scottish Parliament as the first step of its tour to parliaments in 
            London, Brussels, Washington and Astana in Kazakhstan; abhors the 
            fact that between 1940 and 1990, 607 nuclear devices were purposefully 
            detonated by the Soviet regime in the Semipalatinsk region of Kazakhstan, 
            equivalent to the size of Wales, intentionally exposing the 1.5 million 
            inhabitants, as guinea pigs, to the equivalent strength of 20,222 
            Hiroshima bombs with disastrous consequences for both the people and 
            the environment alike; notes with horror that within the Semipalatinsk 
            region cancers run at five times the national average and that birth 
            defects are three times the national average, that many women choose 
            not to have children because of the high risk of physical and mental 
            deformity amongst the new born, that many young men are impotent and 
            that suicides amongst the young are common; offers the Parliament's 
            support to the people of Kazakhstan as they struggle to overcome this 
            prime example of man's inhumanity to man, and affirms the importance 
            of democracy in protecting individuals, communities and the precious 
            environment that we live in.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1096</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>BBC 
            Survey</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the BBC on its recent 
            survey and notes that 77% of people in Scotland support a ban on smoking 
            in public places; agrees that both smoking and second-hand smoke are 
            responsible for widespread ill-health and 13,000 avoidable deaths 
            in Scotland, disproportionately affecting those that live within the 
            poorer constituencies of Scotland, and supports measures that will 
            assist in reducing levels of smoking and exposure to passive smoking, 
            including legislation to regulate smoking in enclosed premises.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1095</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>National 
            Health Service Reform (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees that the National Health Service Reform (Scotland) Bill be 
            passed.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1094</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Tax 
            Freedom Day 2004</strong>-That the Parliament notes that taxpayers 
            will have to work for an extra three days this year, compared to last, 
            solely to pay their taxes before they can work for themselves; further 
            notes that, following the Chancellor's recent budget statement and 
            the consequential increase in government debt, &quot;real&quot; Tax 
            Freedom Day, taking account of taxes and government borrowing, will 
            fall on 11 June, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to reverse 
            this trend to allow taxpayers to keep more of their own money.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1093</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>New 
            Scandinavia/Inverness Air Service</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the new Inverness/Stockholm air service to be run by the Scandinavian 
            airline Snowflake which commences on 29 March 2004; congratulates 
            the staff at Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd on their hard work 
            to negotiate the introduction of this new service using Scottish Executive 
            route development funding; notes that this new service will be an 
            asset to both business and holiday travellers in the Highlands and 
            Sweden, and hopes that this will be the first of many new regular 
            air links between Scandinavia and the Highlands of Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1092</strong> <strong>Campsie Memorial Hall Premature 
            Closure</strong> (lodged on 23 March 2004) Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1091.1</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>GM 
            Crops</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1091) in the name of 
            Mr Mark Ruskell, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;acknowledges that at present there is little support for commercialisation 
            of GM crops; further acknowledges the European and UK legislative 
            framework for GM; notes the legal advice provided by the parliamentary 
            solicitor to the Transport and the Environment Committee and the European 
            and External Relations Committee that the Scottish Executive is not 
            permitted by EU law to impose a blanket ban on, or blanket approval 
            for, GM crops; understands that decisions are required on a case by 
            case basis; welcomes the Executive's decision to reject the commercial 
            growing of spring GM oil seed rape and beet; notes that the Executive 
            does not have scientific evidence nor the powers to ban the cultivation 
            of GM maize; supports the Executive's decision to seek amendment to 
            the EU approval for Chardon LL maize to restrict its cultivation; 
            supports the Executive's decision not to agree seed listing for Chardon 
            LL unless and until such EU changes are made; welcomes the Executive's 
            commitment to consult on coexistence measures that will protect farmers 
            who wish to grow conventional or organic crops, give consumers the 
            choice not to consume GM foods, and introduce compensation and liability 
            measures; supports the Executive's initiative with the farming industry 
            to ensure consumer confidence and consumer choice in Scottish produce, 
            and welcomes the continuing commitment in the Partnership Agreement 
            to apply the precautionary principle.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1090.1</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Protecting 
            Communities - Reforming the Role of Non-Jury Courts</strong>-As an 
            amendment to motion (S2M-1090) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave 
            out from &quot;considers&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the 
            need to have a fair, effective and efficient summary criminal justice 
            system; welcomes the recent report by Sheriff Principal McInnes; acknowledges 
            the note of dissent within the report, and believes that future changes 
            to the summary justice system must impart confidence to everyone: 
            victims, witnesses, accused persons, court users and, above all, the 
            communities they serve.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1089.1</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Zero 
            Waste</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1089) in the name of 
            Shiona Baird, insert at end &quot;and, in line with a zero waste approach, 
            calls on the Executive to recognise the environmental damage done 
            to the community of Greengairs by its present policies on waste and 
            honour its commitment to the community of Greengairs by halting all 
            landfill and opencast developments immediately.&quot;</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Colin Fox<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1089.2</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Zero 
            Waste</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1089) in the name of 
            Shiona Baird, leave out from &quot;urges&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes 
            that Scottish local authorities need to improve their recycling performance 
            by 15.4% over the next two years, three times the figure they have 
            achieved in the last four, to meet the Executive's target of 25% of 
            waste recycled by 2006; calls on the Executive to admit that its top-down 
            approach is not working, and, as an alternative to a zero waste policy, 
            urges it to allow local authorities the flexibility to deliver the 
            best solutions for their areas in the long term.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1089.3</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Zero 
            Waste</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1089) in the name of 
            Shiona Baird, insert at end &quot;and further notes that many of the 
            powers required to reduce waste and achieve a sustainable Scotland 
            reside with Her Majesty's Government and that such powers should be 
            transferred to the Scottish Parliament.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1089.4</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Zero 
            Waste</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1089) in the name of 
            Shiona Baird, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes 
            the recent increase in recycling and composting; notes paragraph 7.3.3 
            of the National Waste Plan 2003 which states that Zero Waste &quot;provides 
            a platform for challenging our current systems and radically reducing 
            waste beyond even the best current levels of achievement&quot; and 
            the aim in the National Waste Plan to stop growth in the amount of 
            municipal waste produced by 2010; further notes the work being carried 
            out by the Waste and Resources Action Programme, Envirowise, the Scottish 
            Environment Protection Agency and others to minimise business and 
            household waste; recognises the Scottish Executive's commitment to 
            increasing packaging recovery targets from 59% to 70% by 2008, and 
            calls on the Executive to continue its work to prevent and minimise 
            waste, to increase recycling and to divert waste from landfill.&quot;</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1065#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Strategic 
            Assessment of Far North Railway</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the Scottish Executive's claim to record investment in public transport; 
            notes its backing for reopening rail routes such as Stirling, Alloa 
            to Kincardine and part of the Waverley line; further notes the recent 
            Highlands and Islands Enterprise report showing that demand for the 
            rail network in the Highlands is growing and that demand could be 
            increased further by more investment in infrastructure and timetables, 
            and considers that the Executive should initiate a strategic assessment 
            of the rail service between Inverness, Thurso and Wick with particular 
            attention to the feasibility of a Dornoch Firth rail crossing to shorten 
            significantly the rail journey times on the route, taking into account 
            specific provision for the Lairg loop stations.</P>
