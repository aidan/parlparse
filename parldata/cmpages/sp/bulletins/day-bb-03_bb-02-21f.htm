            (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3934</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Closure of Egunkaria</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns the actions of the Spanish Government and 
            the Guardia Civil in closing the Basque newspaper Egunkaria and believes 
            that this attack on the democratic rights of the Basque media is an 
            unacceptable practice in the 21st century. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3933</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Current International 
            Situation</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the strength of 
            public opinion on the possibility of military action against Iraq; 
            supports the United Nations' objective to rid Iraq of weapons of mass 
            destruction; recognises that the United Nations weapons inspectors 
            must be given time to complete their investigations in Iraq; believes 
            that recourse to war should only be as a last resort after all political 
            and diplomatic channels have been exhausted, and opposes any military 
            action not sanctioned by a further resolution of the United Nations 
            Security Council and a vote on a substantive motion in the House of 
            Commons.</p>
          <p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Margaret Smith<strong>*</strong>, 
            Iain Smith<strong>*</strong>, Ian Jenkins<strong>*</strong>, Nora 
            Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Mr Keith Raffan<strong>*</strong>, Mr

            Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, John Farquhar Munro<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3932</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Post Office Card 
            Accounts</strong>-That the Parliament believes that those post office 
            customers in Scotland who wish to continue receiving their benefits, 
            pensions payments and tax credits through the Post Office, following 
            the introduction of automated credit transfer in April 2003, should 
            be allowed to do so through a post office card account opened at the 
            counter of a post office or sub-post office; further believes that 
            customers should be offered a genuine choice between the options available, 
            including a post office card account; supports the National Federation 
            of SubPostmasters' call that there should be no administrative obstacles 
            to customers opening a post office card account; notes the importance 
            of post office card accounts to the future financial viability of 
            sub-post offices, and calls upon Scottish ministers to work with Her 
            Majesty's Government to ensure that there is a level playing field 
            in the marketing, promotion and advertising of the banking options 
            from all departments of Her Majesty's Government, including the Department 
            for Work and Pensions, the Inland Revenue and the Veterans Agency, 
            the Scottish Executive and its agencies and local authorities. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3931</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: The Draft Rehabilitation 
            of Offenders Act 1974 (Exclusions and Exceptions) (Scotland) Order 
            2003</strong>-That the Justice 1 Committee, in consideration of the 
            draft Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exclusions and Exceptions) 
            (Scotland) Order 2003, recommends that the Order be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3930</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: The Draft General 
            Commissioners of Income Tax (Expenses) (Scotland) Regulation 2003</strong>-That 
            the Justice 2 Committee, in consideration of the draft General Commissioners 
            of Income Tax (Expenses) (Scotland) Regulations 2003, recommends that 
            the Regulations be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3929</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: Possible Military 
            Action Against Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow 
            City and Dundee City councils on the recent adoption of resolutions 
            against the possible war on Iraq; recognises that, whilst this is 
            ultimately an issue reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament, it 
            remains both the right and responsibility of every elected body within 
            the United Kingdom to express the concerns of their electors; joins 
            with both Glasgow City and Dundee City councils in considering that 
            a pre-emptive attack on Iraq is neither necessary nor justified, and 
            acknowledges that any such unilateral military action contravenes 
            international law and poses a significant threat to international 
            peace and stability.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John McAllion<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3928</strong> <strong>Mr John McAllion: Anti-war Demonstration 
            on 15 February 2003</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">congratulates 
            the Scottish Coalition for Justice not War for organising the magnificent 
            anti-war demonstration in Glasgow on 15 February 2003; salutes the 
            nearly 100,000 Scots that raised their voice against any attack on 
            the people of Iraq; recognises that they represent the true voice 
            of the people of Scotland, and therefore calls on Her Majesty's Government 
            to use its influence in the UN Security Council to negotiate for a 
            peaceful solution to the current crisis.</a></p>
