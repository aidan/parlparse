          <p><strong>*S1M-2297 Mr Tom McCabe on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: 
            Committee Membership</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that Brian 
            Fitzpatrick be appointed to replace Des McNulty on the Enterprise 
            and Lifelong Learning Committee. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2296#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Housing Stock Transfer</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the continuing uncertainty over the proposals 
            for the wholesale transfer of Glasgow City Council&#146;s housing 
            stock; further notes the continuing uncertainty over the date of the 
            ballot of tenants on the housing stock transfer proposals, and believes 
            that in order to remove the uncertainty and to assist the tenants 
            of Glasgow City Council to make a balanced decision based on the merits 
            of the housing stock transfer proposal Her Majesty's Government should 
            immediately write off Glasgow&#146;s housing debt and the Scottish 
            Executive should make available resources to improve Glasgow&#146;s 
            housing stock.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2295</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Kidney Donation and Provision 
            of Renal Units</strong>&#151;That the Parliament records its concern at 
            the current shortage of kidneys for transplant to patients suffering 
            renal failure and that many such patients in Scotland die for want 
            of a transplant; notes that Scotland has fewer renal units per head 
            of population than most other European countries and is near the bottom 
            of the European league for transplantation rates, and calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to bring forward proposals to address these problems, 
            which may include a &quot;presumed consent&quot; system for organ 
            donation of the kind which operates in several other European countries 
            and an improved provision of renal units, particularly in rural Scotland, 
            where patients often have to travel huge distances several times a 
            week for dialysis.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2294#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Welfare Rights Service</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with appreciation recent research findings of 
            the Fraser of Allander Institute which show that last year the benefits 
            generated by the Glasgow City Council Welfare Rights Service led to 
            the creation of 264 jobs in Scotland with a value in wages of £4,491,003; 
            congratulates all of those involved in this remarkable example of 
            job creation, and commends the valuable work undertaken by welfare 
            rights advisers throughout the country.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2293</strong> <strong>Ian Jenkins: Closure of Glencorse Barracks</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with regret the decision of the Ministry of Defence 
            to downgrade its only Scottish training centre to a selection centre 
            resulting in the loss of around 100 jobs and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to consider what assistance it can offer Midlothian Council 
            and local agencies in tackling the loss of a significant local employer 
            in Penicuik and Midlothian.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2291#</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson: Conference of Women Parliamentarians 
            held in the Chamber, 28 and 29 September 2001</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the conference of women parliamentarians held in the chamber 
            on 28 and 29 September 2001; congratulates the National Democratic 
            Institute and the Vital Voices Global Partnership for its initiative 
            in bringing together women parliamentarians in this way; further notes 
            that this was the first time women parliamentarians from Oireachtas 
            Eireann, Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the National 
            Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament have had the opportunity 
            to come together to discuss issues of interest to them, and agrees 
            to the importance of building on the good progress made at the conference 
            in addressing the issue of gender inequality.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2290</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: National Air Traffic Control 
            Centre, Prestwick</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes that the building 
            of a new National Air Traffic Control Centre at Prestwick must proceed 
            without further delay in the interests of public safety and the economic 
            well-being of Scotland and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make 
            the necessary representations to ensure that public investment delivers 
            a fully operational centre no later than 2007 as currently planned.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Andrew Wilson<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2289#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Closure of Scottish Executive 
            Environment and Rural Affairs Department Offices in Stirling, Dundee 
            and Forfar</strong>&#151;That the Parliament regrets the decision of the 
            Scottish Executive to close its Environment and Rural Affairs Department 
            offices in Stirling, Dundee and Forfar; notes that this decision has 
            been taken for financial reasons to reduce annual running costs at 
            a time when the department has admitted to a £66 million underspend 
            in its budget and that it will mean the transfer of staff to a centralised 
            regional office in Perth, and deplores the failure of ministers to 
            consult with the local farming communities on the closure of these 
            offices.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Fergusson<strong>*</strong>, Mr Keith Harding<strong>*</strong>, Lord 
            James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2288</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Proposed Liberal Democrat Policy 
            on "Tourism Tax"</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            proposals to be put to a Liberal Democrats conference that a new tax 
            on tourists should be imposed in Scotland; believes that this proposal 
            would cause further damage to an industry which is already facing 
            severe difficulties, and calls upon all who support a vibrant tourist 
            industry to reject this proposed Liberal Democrat policy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2287</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Consuls and Consuls General 
            in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the effective contribution 
            made to Scottish public life by the Consuls and Consuls General in 
            Scotland; encourages all nations to appoint such representatives pending 
            the opportunities that will exist after independence to welcome Ambassadors 
            and their staffs to Scotland, and, in particular, expresses its thanks 
            to Dan Mulhall, Consul General of Ireland and Kare Hauge, Consul General 
            of Norway, for their work over the crucial period of the establishment 
            of the Parliament and wishes them well as they leave their Edinburgh 
            postings.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2286</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Fife Rail Services</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">recalls motion S1M-379 on rail 
            services in Fife which it debated on 15 December 1999; is concerned 
            that the rail services provided to the people of Fife and beyond are 
            still appalling, that carriages continue to be overcrowded and that 
            trains are still cancelled without notice; believes that the level 
            of delays is still unacceptable and that at peak times insufficient 
            carriages are being provided, and demands that ScotRail and Railtrack 
            take immediate action and provide a service which is commensurate 
            with the high levels of train fares extorted from the long-suffering 
            passengers using these services.</a></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2285.1</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Sports Promotion in Scotland's 
            Schools</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-2285) in the name 
            of Allan Wilson, insert at end &quot;; notes that other European countries 
            prioritise sport in the curriculum but that Scottish schools do not 
            even offer the recommended minimum of two hours of physical education 
            per week and that children at one in seven secondary schools no longer 
            have access to a grass playing field; further notes that almost 40% 
            of schools do not have a football pitch and that the already unacceptably 
            high obesity rates among young Scots are still rising, and therefore 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to cease lodging self-congratulatory 
            motions, to take meaningful action to prioritise sport for children 
            and young people and to ensure that locally available and appropriate 
            facilities are accessible to all.&quot; </p>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Neil<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2285.2</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Sports Promotion in Scotland's 
            Schools</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-2285) in the name

            and educational bodies to embrace and participate fully in these healthy
