<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>*S3M-6493 Irene Oldfather: Scotland&rsquo;s National Dementia Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of Scotland&rsquo;s National Dementia Strategy ahead of Dementia Awareness Week; welcomes the programme of work, including improving staff skills and knowledge in both health and social care settings, implementing dementia care pathway standards and reducing the inappropriate use of psychoactive medication; considers that this programme of action is essential following a series of reports, including <em>Remember, I&rsquo;m Still Me</em>, published jointly by the Care Commission and Mental Welfare Commission, which highlighted the inefficiencies in the quality of care for people with dementia in the community, in care homes and in long-term hospital care; further notes the importance that the strategy places on developing and implementing standards of care, drawing on the <em>Charter of Rights for People with Dementia and Their Carers</em>, which was produced by the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Cross Party Group on Alzheimer&rsquo;s; thanks all those who contributed to the development of both the charter of rights and the strategy, including those who attended the National Dialogue on Dementiaconsultation events held across Scotland; believes that, to be successful, this strategy needs to be properly resourced and monitored in order to ensure that people with dementia receive the highest level of treatment and quality of care that can be given, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a debate on the strategy before the summer recess.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>*S3M-6492 Willie Coffey: James Hamilton Academy Eco-garden</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the students and teachers of James Hamilton Academy in their recent efforts in support of their eco-garden at the school; notes that they have successfully persuaded the National Lottery to support the project with a grant of &pound;6,430, which will deliver a range of environmental measures including demolition of dilapidated bike sheds, landscaping works, including the creation of a raised garden and bird feeders, new lighting and seating and the creation of an eco-greenhouse from plastic bottles, and thanks the school for its continuing efforts to make Kilmarnock and Scotland a greener place.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>*S3M-6490 Stuart McMillan: Dance School of Scotland Pupil Achieves Highest-ever Mark</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hannah Boyce of Milton of Campsie, East Dunbartonshire, and the Dance School of Scotland at Knightswood Secondary School for her phenomenal exam result at the internationally renowned Trinity Guildhall in London; recognises that her score of 94% was not only the highest score this year, but also the highest score that Trinity Guildhall has ever given in the history of the exam; further recognises the enormity of the achievement as Trinity carries out more than 500,000 assessments each year, and wishes her the best of luck as she plans to move to London to attend the Guildford School of Acting.</span></p>
