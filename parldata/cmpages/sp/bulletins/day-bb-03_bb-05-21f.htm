          <p><strong>*S2M-53</strong> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: Junior Scottish 
            Ministers</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that Mr Tom McCabe 
            and Tavish Scott be appointed as junior Scottish Ministers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-52</strong> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: Scottish Ministers</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament agrees that Peter Peacock, Mr Frank McAveety and Nicol 
            Stephen be appointed as Ministers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-52.1</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: Scottish Ministers</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-52) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, 
            leave out &quot;Peter Peacock&quot;.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-52.3</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Scottish Ministers</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-52) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, 
            leave out &quot;Mr Frank McAveety&quot;.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-51</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Fat Cat Salaries</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament expresses its disgust at the obscene average level 
            of fat cat salaries revealed in the <em>Independent</em> on 20 May 
            2003 and calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government to introduce a maximum 
            wage as well as a minimum wage in order to curb these excessive packages.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-50</strong> <strong>Mrs Margaret Smith: Men's Health 
            Week, Scotland: 9-16 June 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament pledges 
            support for Men's Health Week, Scotland, from 9 to 16 June 2003; acknowledges 
            efforts by all sectors to publicise Men's Health Week, Scotland; recognises 
            that most diseases affecting men are preventable and that, as the 
            population of Scotland declines and ages, the burden of treating and 
            caring for increasing numbers of men living longer with chronic disease 
            will be resource intensive; is aware that, by 2050, 60% of adults 
            will be over 65 and that men visit their GPs less than half as often 
            as women and are less likely to have chronic diseases identified and 
            treated early, and calls upon MSPs to assist on-going collaborations 
            by promoting positive messages about healthy ageing, men's health 
            and Men's Health Week, encouraging more men to take responsibility 
            for their own health and well-being.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-49</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon: Books for Baghdad 
            Appeal</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the 
            Books for Baghdad appeal, a campaign to restock Iraq&#146;s libraries; 
            congratulates the University of Edinburgh and the <em>Sunday Herald</em> 
            on taking this initiative; recognises that English-language textbooks 
            and publications are needed, and encourages organisations and individuals 
            across Scotland to contribute to the appeal.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-48</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne: Depleted Uranium 
            Testing at Dundrennan</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the 
            growing campaign against the testing of depleted uranium weapons at 
            Dundrennan in south west Scotland; recognises that there is increasing 
            evidence that these weapons are highly toxic for both the people on 
            whom they are used and the people who use them and for the communities 
            near where they are tested, and calls for full support for the demonstration 
            against depleted uranium weapons at Dundrennan on 29 May 2003.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-47</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank: The Need for 
            a New Secondary School in North-East Fife at the Tay Bridgehead</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the longstanding need for a new secondary school 
            at the Tay Bridgehead in north-east Fife; is aware of widespread local 
            community support in the area for such a school; believes that the 
            school is vital to relieve pressure on Madras College, St Andrews, 
            which is the second largest secondary school in Scotland with a pupil 
            roll of 1,850 and on Bell Baxter High School, Cupar; further notes 
            that the relocation of an additional squadron to RAF Leuchars will 
            increase the pressure on the existing secondary schools and exacerbate 
            the current situation, and, given the seriousness of the matter and 
            the fact that little or no progress has been made on it over the last 
            two decades, considers that the Scottish Executive should intervene 
            and make representations to Fife Council to ensure that a new school 
            is secured.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-46#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Appeals Against 
            Convictions for Serious Crime</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is 
            greatly concerned that the period of time permitted to lodge an appeal 
            against conviction for a serious crime can be incrementally extended 
            over an undefined period; believes that this subjects the victims 
            of these crimes to protracted suffering, and believes that the appeal 
            system should be reviewed.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-45#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Nursery Nurses</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates the nursery nurses who displayed solidarity 
            on the first day of their industrial action; regrets that the nurses 
            have had to resort to such action, and considers that their grading 
            claim should be settled immediately and their professional status 
            recognised.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-44</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson</strong> <strong>on 
            behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau</strong>:<strong> Business Motion</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&#151;</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-43#</strong> <strong>Mr Richard Baker: Dental Services

            for a dental outreach centre outlined by the new Scottish Executive 
            in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em>; recognises that there
