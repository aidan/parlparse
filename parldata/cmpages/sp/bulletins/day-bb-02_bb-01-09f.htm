          <p><strong>*S1M-2586</strong> <strong> Brian Adam: Winter Maintenance 
            of North East Roads</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the Minister 
            for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning to investigate the 
            performance of BEAR Scotland Ltd and councils in the north east in 
            maintaining roads and pavements in a safe condition during the recent

          <p><strong><a name="2585"></a>*S1M-2585#</strong> <strong>Angus MacKay: 
            The Colin O'Riordan Trust </strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the outstanding contribution made by the late Dr Colin O'Riordan to 
            the provision of access to music for all children in Edinburgh, and 
            particularly Sciennes Primary School, and throughout Scotland, in 
            founding the City of Edinburgh Music School and in the many youth 
            orchestra activities with which he was associated, and congratulates 
            his family on the foundation of the Colin O'Riordan Trust, which aims 
            to assist aspiring young musicians by promoting musical excellence 
            and improving access to musical instruments for those children who 
            might otherwise not have the opportunity to pursue music.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2584</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Power 
            Industrial Dispute</strong>-That the Parliament supports the strike 
            action of Scottish Power workers in pursuit of their agreement of 
            31 May 2000 with Scottish Power management which stated that no job 
            losses and no fundamental changes to conditions would result from 
            the trade unions' agreement to work in partnership alongside the company; 
            regrets that Scottish Power management is now reneging on this agreement 
            and is intent on fundamentally changing working conditions, which 
            includes transferring staff against their will to a new joint venture 
            company; notes that this has resulted in a democratic ballot of union 
            members within Scottish Power; further notes union members' decision 
            to take part in a series of two-day strike actions, and therefore 
            calls on the management of Scottish Power to end its confrontational 
            stance and honour the agreement it signed in good faith with the unions 
            in order to avoid any further inconvenience to Scottish citizens, 
            particularly in relation to power cuts and consequential safety issues.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2582</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie: Scottish 
            Economy</strong>-That the Parliament notes with grave concern that 
            in excess of 20,000 jobs were lost throughout the Scottish economy 
            in 2001 and that the Scottish economy has failed to perform as well 
            as the UK economy; further notes that the higher business rate poundage 
            in Scotland relative to England is having a damaging effect on the 
            competitiveness of Scotland's economy, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to restore as a matter of urgency a business rate poundage 
            uniform with the rest of the UK as part of a sustained effort to reduce 
            burdens of tax and regulation, which are hindering the creation of 
            jobs and prosperity in Scotland, and demonstrate to the business community 
            a commitment to restoring growth and competitiveness to the Scottish 
            economy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2581</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Perth Royal 
            Infirmary Laboratory Services</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            discussion document produced by Tayside University Hospitals NHS Trust 
            on the future of laboratory services at Perth Royal Infirmary (PRI); 
            recognises that upheaval and uncertainty have been the hallmark of 
            health service provision in Perthshire in recent years and that patients, 
            staff and the general public require a period of stability; welcomes 
            the recognition within the document that, as an Acute Hospital with 
            the full range of District General Hospital Services, PRI will require 
            on-site laboratory services for biochemical medicine, haematology 
            and blood transfusion &quot;at the very least&quot;; acknowledges 
            the strong arguments put forward for relocating laboratory facilities 
            closer to the wards, and rejects suggestions that pathology and microbiology 
            services be relocated to Ninewells Hospital.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2580</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Education (Disability

            resulting from the Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils' Records)

            in non-trunk roads in the Highlands being in an extremely dangerous 
            condition; recognises that this has come about as a result of the 
            Highland Council downsizing its winter roads maintenance service as 
            a result of the trunk roads maintenance contract being awarded to 
            BEAR Scotland Ltd, and accordingly considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should undertake an urgent review of all roads maintenance in the 
            Highland Council area in order to avoid any future repetition of the 
            recent dangerous problems.</p>

            that the Parliament has undertaken impressive work but regrets the 
            loss of trust in government caused by the actions of the Executive; 
            calls on the Executive to dramatically improve its performance in 
            delivering public services on health, education, transport and jobs, 
            crime and on the environment, and agrees that only by equipping this 
            Parliament with the powers of a normal independent Parliament will 
            Scotland be able to reach its full potential.&quot; </p>

            the delivery of first class public services by well-paid and motivated 
            public service workers is incompatible with the continued use of PFI/PPP 
            methods of public service financing; resolves therefore to end the 
            havoc of service and staff reductions caused by PFI/PPP and instead 
            to ensure adequate funding of public service expansion and improvement 
            through public investment dedicated to the needs of all Scotland's 
            citizens, instead of through PFI/PPP which is dedicated to the delivery 
            of profit to private corporation shareholders, and resolves that 2002 
            should become the Public Investment in Public Services year, delivering 
            tangible improvements in public services throughout Scotland and improving 
            significantly the wages and working conditions of the army of currently
