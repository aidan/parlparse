<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Socialist Party Debate &ndash; Housing Stock Transfer&mdash;</p>
<p><em>&#9;</em><strong>S2M-5104</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Housing Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to embark on a programme of council house building; believes that the chronic shortage of affordable new homes has led to a huge increase in house prices in Scotland; notes that the average cost of a new home is now &pound;130,000 and thus excludes more than one third of Scots from owning their own homes; demands that the UK Treasury releases the funds already identified to provide the necessary social housing that local circumstances demand; believes that tenants across Scotland have repeatedly rejected housing stock transfer, seeing it as plain and simple privatisation; believes in the fullest democratic control and management of council homes by tenants; welcomes the decision of Midlothian Council to build 1,000 new houses; calls on the tenants of both Highland and Inverclyde councils to follow the example of council tenants in Edinburgh, Stirling and Renfrewshire and reject privatisation of their housing stock; believes that the promises made to Glasgow tenants by Glasgow Housing Association have not been kept, and believes that stock transfer, the Executive&rsquo;s flagship housing policy, is now in tatters. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5104.4</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Housing Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5104) in the name of Colin Fox, leave out from first &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;commends the initiatives by the Scottish Executive to increase the quantity of affordable housing in Scotland through its increased investment programme, which will deliver over 16,500 new affordable homes for rent and nearly 5,000 for low-cost home ownership by 2008, and through its Homestake low-cost home ownership scheme and its use of the planning system to increase supply; supports the principle of housing transfer to community ownership to improve the quality of existing housing where this has the support of the tenants; agrees that transfer has the potential to deliver a substantial package of benefits for tenants, including increased investment in their homes, rent guarantees and a much greater say in how their homes are managed, and recognises that transfer is indeed now delivering substantial new investment for tenants, as confirmed by Audit Scotland.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5104.2</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Housing Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5104) in the name of Colin Fox, leave out from first &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the failure of the Scottish Executive to adequately fund Scottish housing and its refusal to consider any other funding options than large-scale voluntary transfer; deplores the lack of real choice offered to Scottish tenants; condemns the Executive&rsquo;s failure to deliver the promise of second-stage transfer to the tenants of Glasgow Housing Association, and calls on the Minister for Communities to make immediate representations to the UK Treasury for the write-off of local authorities&rsquo; capital housing debt without preconditions.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5104.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Housing Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5104) in the name of Colin Fox, leave out from first &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the transfer of local government housing to communities run by locally accountable housing associations, co-operatives and companies and notes the recent Audit Scotland report which concluded that the handover of more than 100,000 council homes to new landlords since 1998 has brought more investment in properties and promoted tenant control as well as facilitating increased repairs and maintenance and the building of new homes and keeping rent increases down; therefore urges all tenants to seriously consider voting for the stock transfer of their homes, but notes, however, that the Scottish Executive now needs to address urgently the issues preventing the second stage transfer in Glasgow and to publish what it and the City of Edinburgh Council now plan to do for the future of Edinburgh&rsquo;s housing stock, with a view to assisting in future investment for vital affordable housing.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Socialist Party Debate &ndash; Funding Equal Pay&mdash;</p>
<p><em>&#9;</em><strong>S2M-5105</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Funding Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Scottish Executive has a responsibility, which includes the allocation of appropriate funding to assist local authorities, in agreement with the trade unions, to achieve equal pay and maintain public services. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5105.4</strong> <strong>George Lyon: Funding Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5105) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that closing the equal pay gap will benefit all Scots, Scotland&rsquo;s workplaces and Scotland&rsquo;s economy; agrees that it is the responsibility of local authorities as independent bodies to implement the single status pay agreement which they themselves negotiated, and encourages employers and unions to make every effort to reach an agreement that is fair and equitable and protects the staff concerned, council taxpayers and the services that local authorities deliver.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5105.1</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: Funding Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5105) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;calls on the Scottish Executive to facilitate discussions between COSLA, local authorities and trade unions to deliver a fair and speedy resolution to the equal pay and single status issue and to ensure that the implications of such agreement are reflected in the 2007-08 local authority financial settlement.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5105.2</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee: Funding Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5105) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the principles of the Equal Pay Act 1970; condemns the failure of local authorities and trades unions to reach agreement on the implementation of single status; recognises the importance of protecting taxpayers at all levels from the consequences of this failure, and calls on the Scottish Executive to exert pressure on local authorities and trades unions to reach an agreement fair to employees and taxpayers.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>S2M-5027</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Historical Places and Artefacts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the support given by the Scottish Executive to conserve Scotland&rsquo;s heritage; believes that a knowledge of the buildings, monuments, historic sites and ancient artefacts in Scotland contributes to our knowledge of ourselves as a nation; welcomes the recent announcements on funding to protect ancient battlefields and historic buildings and to support local projects; further welcomes the statutory protection given to listed buildings and ancient monuments; considers that the voluntary register of historic sites maintained by most local authorities is a welcome source of information on Scotland&rsquo;s history and peoples; congratulates the Council for Scottish Archaeology and national, local authority and community historical, archaeological and museum groups which work tirelessly to research, identify and conserve places such as the Henge at Balfarg in Glenrothes and the Bronze Age burial cist at Sillerhole in Leven and display artefacts in both national and local museums such as Lower Methil Heritage Centre; believes that opportunities exist to give further protection through legislative measures; welcomes the offer by the Deputy Minister for Communities to discuss such opportunities in the context of the current planning Bill, and believes that all MSPs and ministers should consider what further support can be given to protect Scotland&rsquo;s historical places and artefacts. </p>
