<STRONG>Donald Gorrie: Debt and Lending</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned 
by the number of households badly affected by debt and by the contribution to 
debt problems made by banks, retailers issuing credit cards, building societies 
and money lenders vigorously encouraging people to borrow more money, when they 
are already heavily in debt or obviously have no means of repaying the loan, and 
as regulation in this sphere is outwith the powers of the Parliament, believes 
that the Scottish Executive should address this issue by means of holding discussions 
with these lending bodies to seek voluntary agreements that they will not advertise 
or press credit on people that are manifestly not creditworthy and should ask 
the banks instead to lend money to credit unions for them to lend to people of 
limited means on the basis of such unions&#146; better assessment of the likelihood 
of each loan.</P><P>Supported by: Robert Brown<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Nora Radcliffe<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

<STRONG>*S1M-3463</STRONG> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie: Redundancy Insurance</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament, in light of the experience of the Citizens Advice Bureaux in giving 
advice to people that become unemployed, urges insurance companies to make much 
clearer the limit and extent of cover, in relation to credit and debt issues, 
given by their policies guarding people against redundancy and to highlight the 
limit and extent of such cover in the relevant proposal forms and related literature.</P><P>Supported 
by: Robert Brown<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Nora Radcliffe<STRONG>*</STRONG>, George Lyon<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Tavish Scott<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Robin Harper<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3462</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Sweet Sixteen</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
the team responsible for the film Sweet Sixteen which was made and premiered in 
Greenock and won the best script award at the Cannes Film Festival; notes with 
concern the decision of the British Board of Film Classification to give the film 
an &quot;18&quot; rating meaning that many of the young actors who made the film 
would not be allowed to view it; believes that this is clearly absurd and that, 
further, the decisions on what Scots see in the cinema should be decided in Scotland, 
and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s 
Government to devolve decisions on censorship to Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3461</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Adam: Grampian Addiction Problem Service (GAPS)</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament acknowledges the great contribution made by the Grampian Addiction 
Problem Service (GAPS) and, in particular, the efforts of Janice Jess in helping 
addicts and their families in the north-east of Scotland and calls on the Scottish 
Executive to place a duty on health authorities and local authorities to support 
and encourage community-based groups such as GAPS.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3460 Mr 
Murray Tosh on behalf of the Procedures Committee: Standards Commissioner - Procedures 
Committee&#146;s 4th Report 2002</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament agrees the 
recommendations for changes to the Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament 
concerning the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner contained in the 
Procedures Committee&#146;s 4th Report 2002, Changes<em> to the Standing Orders 
concerning the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, European Committee 
remit, Private Legislation, Temporary Conveners and the Journal of the Scottish 
Parliament </em>(SP Paper 665), and agrees that these changes shall come into effect 
on 14 October 2002. </P><P>Supported by: Mr Kenneth Macintosh<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3459#</STRONG> <STRONG>Elaine Thomson: Aberdeen Renewable Energy 
Group</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the work of the Aberdeen Renewable 
Energy Group and the recent adoption of their action plan by Aberdeen City Council 
as providing a way forward for Aberdeen and the north-east; believes that the 
adoption of the plan will be to the benefit of Scotland&#146;s economy given the 
area&#146;s existing skills and intellectual capital in the Scottish oil and gas 
industry; notes Aberdeen&#146;s international position as the energy capital of 
Europe; recognises the immense opportunities offered by the development of an 
indigenous Scottish renewable industry to exploit Scotland&#146;s unrivalled renewable 
energy resources, particularly in the north of Scotland, and further notes the 
opportunities for the export of renewable technologies and expertise.</P><P>Supported

<STRONG>Margaret Smith: Draft West Edinburgh Planning Framework</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the recent publication of the draft West Edinburgh Planning 
Framework and recognises west Edinburgh&#146;s significant contribution to Scotland&#146;s 
economy, transport and environment.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3457</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr 
Brian Monteith: The Complete Songs of Robert Burns</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
congratulates Dr Fred Freeman of the University of Edinburgh and Ivor Tiefenbrun 
of Linn Records on successfully completing the seven-and-a-half-year project to 
produce the only complete recordings of the songs of Robert Burns; recognises 
that the cultural, social and political significance of this project is far reaching, 
the approach to Burns and to his music is unique, setting him in a context which 
links together each region of the country and Scotland with Europe and the world, 
and wishes every good fortune in sales of the recordings to the public, local 
libraries and Burns societies.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Murdo Fraser<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3456</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Andy 
Kerr: Building (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament,

Bill, agrees to&#151;</P><P></P><DIR> <DIR> <P>(a) any increase in expenditure

<STRONG>*S1M-3448</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Death of Yoni Jesner</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">expresses horror at the death of 19-year-old 
Yoni Jesner from Giffnock in East Renfrewshire at the hands of a suicide bomber 
in a public street in Tel Aviv on 19 September 2002; acknowledges the impact of 
this atrocity on the Jewish community here in Scotland; believes there can be 
no justification for such an appalling act; wishes to express its sympathy to 
Yoni's family and friends; is greatly moved by the donation of Yoni's *kidneys* 
and other organs, which have been used to save the life of a young Palestinian 
child, and believes that such a practical and symbolic gesture demonstrates the 
power of tolerance, friendship and common humanity over hate and violence.</A></P><P>Supported
