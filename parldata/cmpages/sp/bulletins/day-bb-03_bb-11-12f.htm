          <p><strong>*S2M-594</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Celebrating 
            150 Years of Public Libraries in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that this year marks the 150th anniversary of the Public Libraries 
            Act in Scotland; congratulates public libraries on the diverse service 
            they provide and, in particular, commends them for the success of 
            the People's Network in encouraging even greater use of library facilities, 
            and praises local authorities for the part they play in providing 
            this service.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-593</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Reforming 
            Child Protection in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that 
            keeping Scotland's children and young people safe from harm and neglect 
            must be a priority for all; agrees the importance of having a sustainable 
            programme of reform of child protection services; notes the progress 
            on the three-year child protection reform programme and future plans, 
            and supports the Scottish Executive's decision to require local authorities, 
            NHS boards and the police to review their practices in respect of 
            child protection, take action where there are weaknesses, ensure that 
            there are robust quality assurance processes in place and continue 
            with initiatives to ensure that there are sufficient and well-trained 
            social workers to meet current and projected needs.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-592</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>South 
            Lanarkshire Council's School Closures</strong>-That the Parliament 
            is concerned by the decisions taken by South Lanarkshire Council with 
            regard to secondary school provision; believes that these decisions 
            were based on a flawed consultation process and flawed information, 
            including inaccurate demographic information; further believes that 
            the council did not take full cognisance of the community's view and, 
            indeed, misinterpreted the nature of substantial opposition; considers 
            that the council has not proven the benefits of such large schools 
            as planned in East Kilbride, which are much bigger than anywhere else 
            in South Lanarkshire; is concerned that the council has not taken 
            sufficient cognisance of the travel problems that will ensue and has 
            left the south of East Kilbride, which has a population on the lowest 
            incomes in East Kilbride and the greatest housing expansion, with 
            no secondary provision whatsoever, and considers that the Minister 
            for Education and Young People should not approve any of South Lanarkshire's 
            proposed closures but should recommend that the council re-opens the 
            consultation process.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-591</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of 
            the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>-That

          <p> <strong>*S2M-585</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Ghost

            Council in refusing to allow the break-up of American ghost ships, 
            which contain toxic chemicals, in their community; recognises that 
            these ships contain a massive amount of asbestos, a hazard to any 
            community, and believes that these ships are not in a good condition 
            and should be sent back immediately and not stored in a port over 
            the winter.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-584#</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Maternity

            Services (EGAMS); is aware of the context of falling birth rates in 
            the regions of Scotland against which EGAMS was established; congratulates 
            all staff who provide maternity services within NHS Borders on their 
            work, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that 
            consultant-led maternity services at Borders General Hospital are 
            retained.</P>

            Services Union at Scottish Natural Heritage's (SNH) headquarters in 
            Edinburgh expressed their opposition to the forced relocation to Inverness 
            and will not transfer when their jobs move; notes that the remaining 
            30% will only move with improved and enhanced conditions; further 
            notes that this lack of staff support will impose a serious threat 
            to the long-term effectiveness and efficiency of SNH to carry out 
            its core function of protecting Scotland's natural heritage, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to stop this move before it brings the Executive's
