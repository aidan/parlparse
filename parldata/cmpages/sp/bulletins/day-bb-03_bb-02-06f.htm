          <p><strong>*S1M-3863#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Dispersal of 
            Civil Service Jobs</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the progress 
            made to date on the dispersal of civil service jobs throughout Scotland; 
            believes that an assessment should be made of the benefits that dispersal 
            has brought to the respective local economies; notes the pending dissolution 
            of the Parliament and seeks early expedition of the timetable for 
            dispersal to ensure further progress; acknowledges that the selection 
            criteria for such dispersals take account of cost, operational effectiveness, 
            social, economic and environmental considerations and the position 
            of staff; but nonetheless considers that priority should be given 
            in future dispersals to areas such as Ayrshire, where there are above 
            average levels of unemployment, to ensure that all of Scotland's communities 
            share in the economic and social benefits of the policy of relocation.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3862</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon: Commissioner for 
            Children and Young People (Scotland) Bill - Stage 3</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees that the Commissioner for Children and Young 
            People (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3861</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe: Inauguration of 
            the MacRobert Prize, RAF Cranwell</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that the MacRobert Prize will be awarded for the first time on 6 February 
            2003 at RAF Cranwell and congratulates all that have contributed to 
            the inauguration of this prize, which is in keeping with the second 
            world war sentiments of Lady MacRobert expressed in the MacRobert 
            motto &quot;Not For Self But For Country&quot; and celebrates the 
            uniquely Scottish connection with the Royal Air Force of the name 
            and legacy of MacRobert and the MacRobert's Reply, a legacy that should 
            not be forgotten, which will now be proudly commemorated and carried 
            into the future in every successive year at RAF Cranwell.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Mike Rumbles<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3860#</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh: Arbroath CAFE 
            Project</strong>-That the Parliament applauds the pioneering work 
            of the Arbroath CAFE Project which provides an invaluable service 
            for young people in the area; notes that a safe, community alcohol-free 
            environment was established where young people could socialise and 
            engage in a wide range of activities, providing a positive alternative 
            to &quot;life on the street&quot;; recognises the success of the project 
            which has received national and international recognition and is being 
            used as a model for projects elsewhere in the country and further 
            afield; congratulates the project on being chosen as the launch pad 
            in Scotland of the British Council's global Dreams and Teams project 
            and on its plans to launch a pilot scheme, &quot;Street Football for 
            All &quot; to take place throughout Angus with a view to becoming 
            a national project, and wishes the CAFE Project every success with 
            both these initiatives and in continuing to provide opportunities 
            for young people and the wider community. </p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3859</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson: National Asthma 
            Campaign Scotland Manifesto, A Breath of Fresh Air </strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>A breath of fresh air 
            - a manifesto for the next Scottish Executive</em> produced by National 
            Asthma Campaign Scotland; commends the Campaign's work to advance 
            the interests of people with asthma; notes that the cost of asthma 
            in Scotland is estimated as approaching £200 million a year; notes 
            that 101 people died from asthma in Scotland in 2001 and over 7000 
            were admitted to hospital; notes that the measures in <em>A breath 
            of fresh air</em> include making asthma a priority for primary health 
            care, introducing legislation on smoking in public places and matching 
            the National Asthma Campaign's investment in asthma research; notes 
            the example of the Australian Government, which has made asthma a 
            health priority, and calls on the Scottish Executive to give consideration 
            to the realistic, costed and comprehensive proposals set out in <em>A 
            breath of fresh air</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3858</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Parliament Mail 
            Services Contract And Royal Mail</strong>-That the Parliament directs 
            that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should ensure that 
            the Royal Mail continue to be contracted to operate the Parliament's 
            internal mail and all associated services in the light of the superb 
            performance of its staff that have undertaken this contract in the 
            four years since the inception of the Parliament.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3727.1</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: Proportional Representation

            to motion (S1M-3727) in the name of Tricia Marwick, leave out from 
            &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the Local Government 
            Committee's Stage 1 Report on the Proportional Representation (Local 
            Government Elections) Bill and that any change to the election system 
            could not come into effect until the 2007 local government elections 
            at the earliest; further notes the publication by the Scottish Executive 
            of its <em>Local Governance (Scotland) Bill </em>document<em> </em>which 
            fulfils the commitments made to make progress on electoral reform 
            and deals with wider issues to encourage greater participation in 
            local government, and, with regard to the Proportional Representations 
            (Local Government Elections) Bill, therefore does not agree to the 
            general principles of this particular Bill for the reason that its 
            provisions demonstrably do not meet the extensive requirements for 
            renewing local democracy.&quot; </p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3715# Robin Harper: Theatre in Scotland-</strong>That

            theatre; notes the cutbacks at Brunton Theatre; notes the contribution 
            made over the years by groups such as the TAG Theatre Company, 7:84, 
            Borderline, Theatre in Education and TWE Edinburgh; further notes 
            the looming funding crisis for repertory theatre, especially the Royal 
            Lyceum in Edinburgh; notes that unless funding equivalent to the funding 
            available to theatre in England and Wales is made available, there 
            will be a drift of talent southwards that will result in the ability 
            of professional theatre to survive in Scotland being undermined in 
            the near future*.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
