          <p><strong>*S1M-3585</strong> <strong>Ben Wallace: Armed Forces Personnel 
            and Firefighting Duties</strong>-That the Parliament supports the 
            brave young men and women of the armed forces in Scotland who are 
            putting their lives at risk in order to cover the reckless and dangerous 
            strike by Scottish firefighters; demands that the Scottish Executive 
            immediately steps up concurrent training for armed forces personnel 
            to allow them to use better firefighting equipment and, in addition, 
            gives them access to basic protective clothing; believes that public 
            safety and the safety of the armed forces personnel must come before 
            trade union demands, and notes that the armed forces carry out these 
            essential services ill-equipped and for considerably lower pay than 
            firefighters and with no right to strike.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong>, 
            Phil Gallie<strong>*</strong>, John Young<strong>*</strong>, Lord 
            James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, 
            John Scott<strong>*</strong>, Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3584#</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Edinburgh Park 
            Railway Station</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent announcement 
            that construction of the Edinburgh Park Railway Station can begin; 
            welcomes the funding supplied by the Strategic Rail Authority, City 
            of Edinburgh Council and New Edinburgh Ltd; further welcomes the investment 
            in new rolling stock from the Scottish Executive; is concerned that 
            agreement on the project was delayed by performance targets; considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should examine how this station can serve 
            the Edinburgh to Glasgow rail line, and asks the Executive to ensure 
            that construction of the station and the provision of additional rolling 
            stock is completed as soon as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3583</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: White Ribbon 
            Campaign to End Violence Against Women</strong>-That the Parliament 
            supports the White Ribbon Campaign, which leads up to the UN International 
            Day Against Women on 25 November 2002; recognises the white ribbon 
            as the international symbol for a world where women and girls can 
            live free from the fear of violence; supports the work of the UK White 
            Ribbon Campaign, co-ordinated by WOMANKIND Worldwide, to raise funds 
            and awareness to end violence against women; notes with alarm the 
            prevalence and gravity of violence against women, with one in four 
            women in the UK experiencing domestic violence at some point in their 
            lives, and one in 20 women suffering rape, and at least one in every 
            three women around the world being beaten, coerced into sex, or abused 
            in some other way, and urges MSPs and others to support this campaign 
            by wearing a white ribbon to show their support for ending violence 
            against women.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3582</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Personal Care</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern that The Highland Council has considered 
            tightening the rules covering eligibility for free personal care because 
            of a funding shortfall of about £300,000; further notes that more 
            than 75,000 people in Scotland are estimated to be eligible for free 
            care following the decision by the Parliament and the Scottish Executive 
            to provide such free care; recognises that the council received just 
            over £4 million from the Executive to meet the costs of providing 
            free personal and nursing care in its area but that demand has proven 
            to be higher than predicted, and calls on the Executive to fulfil 
            its commitment to free personal care by meeting the shortfall in funding 
            as soon as possible. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3581#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler: Schooling of Children 
            of Asylum Seekers</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            with concern the requirement contained within the Nationality, Immigration 
            and Asylum Act 2002, which stipulates that the children of asylum 
            seekers be schooled outwith the mainstream local authority education 
            system in purpose-built accommodation centres; fears that such a condition, 
            which requires separate educational provision for the children of 
            asylum seekers, will in effect lead to segregation rather than integration; 
            acknowledges that the present arrangement, as evidenced by a recent 
            survey conducted in Glasgow, is both inclusive and successful, and 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations 
            to the Home Secretary, the purpose of which would be to arrive at 
            an agreement whereby the current distinctive approach pertaining to 
            the schooling of asylum seeker children in Scotland is allowed to 
            continue.</a></p>
