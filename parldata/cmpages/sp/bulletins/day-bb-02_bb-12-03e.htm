            Reform (Scotland) Bill provides for the purchase of "salmon fishings 
            contiguous to" croft land when the intention of the bill is to provide 
            for the purchase of salmon fishings that are exercisable from croft

            Bill.</p>

            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-30833 
            by Ross Finnie on 18 November 2002, why, if it is its policy to give 
            crofting communities the opportunity to buy their croft land, it also

            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-30835 
            by Ross Finnie on 18 November 2002, whether it is satisfied, bearing 
            in mind the opinion of the Court of Session in the case of <em>County 
            Properties </em>v<em> the Scottish Ministers</em> and, in particular, 
            paragraph 19 of that opinion, that the approval of applications made 
            under Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will be fair, given 
            that none of the safeguards mentioned in paragraph 19 of the opinion 
            will be present.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-32174</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask

            interest tests when an application is made under Part 3 of the Land 
            Reform (Scotland) Bill, namely that the application is in the public 
            interest using the qualified definition in the bill and that it is 
            in the public interest in the normal sense of the phrase as applied 
            to Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-32175</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask

            and S1W-30837 by Ross Finnie on 18 November 2002, why, if the exercise 
            of the crofting community right to buy under the Land Reform (Scotland) 
            Bill must be in the public interest in order to be compatible with 
            the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), there is no test of

            1 of Protocol 1 of ECHR, in the bill.</p>
