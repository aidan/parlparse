<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4341</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Cuts to Compensation for Mesothelioma Sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that sufferers of mesothelioma and their families face massive cuts in their compensation following a ruling by the House of Lords which, at the same time as depriving vulnerable and low income families of much needed monies, will reward insurance companies with billions of pounds; believes that this decision means that workers injured by their employers will continue to be denied justice, and further believes that, if the law has been applied accurately, then the law is inadequate and that legislation should be urgently introduced to ensure full settlement for sufferers and families and that natural justice prevails.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4340</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>James Watt College, Greenock</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is both shocked and appalled that the Principal and the Board of James Watt College in Greenock have breached the terms of collective agreements with the teaching trade union, the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), have issued 90-day redundancy notices to the entire academic staff and have announced the intention to make one-in-five of all academic staff redundant, whereby only those who sign new contracts with much worse terms and conditions will be re-employed; congratulates EIS members at the college who have voted by 94% in favour of industrial action; calls for solidarity in support of their strike action; believes that the college board has taken this unilateral action not to deal with a financial deficit but to make a profit of &pound;2 million next year; further believes that this is irresponsible management of public money, and calls for the immediate withdrawal of the redundancy notices and the resumption of negotiations with the EIS representatives.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4339</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Richard Lochhead be appointed as the Scottish National Party substitute on the European and External Relations Committee.</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4338</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Richard Lochhead be appointed to the Environment and Rural Development Committee.</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4337&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Birth of James Clerk Maxwell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the 175th anniversary of the birth of James Clerk Maxwell on 13 June 2006; recognises his great achievement in discovering the nature of electromagnetic waves which opened the way to the invention of television, radio, radar and the mobile phone; applauds his work on colour perception which enabled the successful development of colour television and colour photography, and believes that he is worthy of greater recognition throughout Scotland, given the acknowledgement of Albert Einstein, who said that &quot;the special theory of relativity owes its origins to Maxwell&rsquo;s equations of the electromagnetic field&quot;, and of Ivan Tolstoy, who wrote &quot;Maxwell&rsquo;s importance in the history of scientific thought is comparable to Einstein&rsquo;s (whom he inspired) and to Newton&rsquo;s (whose influence he curtailed)&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4336</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>J K Galbraith</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of the great Scots-Canadian economist, Professor J K Galbraith, Emeritus Professor of Economics at the University of Harvard, United States of America, former ambassador to India in John F Kennedy&rsquo;s administration, prolific writer of varied texts, including <em>The Non-Potable Scotch</em>, a recollection of boyhood in a Scottish community in Ontario, and hails the full and interesting life of this great man whose roots and ancestry lay in Crinan in Argyll.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4335</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Release of Ministerial Briefing Note on &quot;Fiscal autonomy - full fiscal powers - financial independence&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision by coalition ministers to withhold from public scrutiny the Executive briefing note entitled &quot;Fiscal Autonomy &ndash; full fiscal powers &ndash; financial independence&quot; which was requested under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 and suggests that the reason that ministers are so coy over its release is that such a document will be likely to support the case for a free and sovereign Scottish nation; believes that its release is fundamentally in the public interest to inform the debate over Scotland&rsquo;s destiny, and acknowledges that only through independence can Scotland flourish.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4334</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>John Muir Trust - Journey for the Wild 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the initiative of the John Muir Trust in arranging the 2006 Journey for the Wild, an epic adventure through some of the wildest places in the country; recognises that the aim of the initiative is to raise awareness of wild places for people and nature; notes that the journey will cover 2,500 miles during five months of the summer of 2006, with routes from the north, south, east and west culminating in a celebration at Ben Nevis, and welcomes the fact that its final route will deliver a message about the value of wild places to the Parliament at Holyrood on 4 October 2006.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4333</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>EU Fisheries and the Western Sahara</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recently concluded fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco; regrets that the agreement does not exclude from its scope the waters off the occupied territory of Western Sahara; considers that this is potentially in violation of international law, and calls on the Scottish Executive to urge Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to reject in the Council of Ministers any such agreement which does not exclude the waters off Western Sahara.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4332</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle:</strong> <strong>Scottish Local Government Investment in the Tobacco Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the success of the ban on smoking in public places, introduced as a result of the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act in March 2006; notes with concern that local authorities can still invest public funds in the tobacco industry; believes that, in the absence of a clear ruling, local fund managers will continue this practice, and calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce legislation in support of administering authorities fully considering ethical issues in future investments.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4331</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle:</strong> <strong>Scottish Beef Exports</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive on the resumption of exports of Scottish beef and further congratulates Scotbeef in Bridge of Allan for spearheading this re-opening of the European markets, thus fulfilling a welcome boost to the Scottish agricultural economy and, after a ten-year period of abstinence from eating this delicacy, allowing Europeans to once again savour the delights of beef reared in environmentally friendly conditions and according to the highest standards of animal welfare.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4329.3</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Pledge Against New Nuclear Power Stations in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4329) in the name of Shiona Baird, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;appreciates the work of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management; welcomes the position statement on its draft recommendations published by the committee on 27 April 2006; agrees that the review of options for the long-term management of radioactive waste, currently being undertaken by the committee, is the correct means of engaging Scotland on the crucial issue of finding a long-term management option for higher activity radioactive waste, and notes the Executive&rsquo;s position, as outlined in the Partnership Agreement, that it will not support the further development of nuclear power stations while waste management issues remain unresolved.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4306*#*</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s First Social Enterprise Trade Fair</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in organising Scotland&rsquo;s first social enterprise trade fair; notes that the event was oversubscribed by exhibitors wishing to participate and that over 600 delegates registered for the event; further notes that, in Scotland, there are already 1,100 social enterprises which collectively deliver around &pound;1.25 billion to the economy and employ some 30,000 people; believes that the social enterprise sector has the capacity to grow much more and become an established part of the business mix; acknowledges the wide support for social enterprises from the Parliament and the Scottish Executive, particularly through the creation of the Co-operative Development Agency; recognises that social enterprises have a significant role to play in reducing poverty, promoting sustainable communities and delivering key social and environmental benefits in Central Fife and across Scotland, and wishes all those working in the sector continued and increasing success.</p>
