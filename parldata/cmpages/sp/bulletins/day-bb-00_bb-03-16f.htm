    </strong><p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-665</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Border Television</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes the unique position of Border Television serving the South of Scotland,
    North West England and the Isle of Man; notes its consistent ability to achieve the
    highest percentage of viewing figures for any local news programme in the United Kingdom;
    notes that there has been considerable speculation regarding a takeover of Border
    Television by other media organisations, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make
    appropriate representations to Her Majesty&#146;s Government to ensure that the quality
    and the volume of the news programming and other local production is maintained.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    </strong><p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-664</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Lung Cancer</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    notes with serious concern that lung cancer has overtaken breast cancer as the leading
    cause of cancer-related deaths and that women who smoke are twice as likely as male
    smokers to develop lung cancer; further notes with concern that smoking remains prevalent
    among young women; recognises that early detection of lung cancer is the key to long-term
    survival, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to support clinical trials of lung cancer
    screening techniques that could identify lung tumours while they are small enough to be
    surgically curable.</p>
