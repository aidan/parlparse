          <p> <strong>*S1M-3257#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Death of 
            Mrs Annie Davies</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the tragic death of Mrs Annie Davies, 84, of Aytoun Drive, Erskine 
            on 30 May 1998; is aware of ambiguities surrounding her death, with 
            eminent forensic pathologists expressing a view that there is strong 
            evidence of foul play that conflicts with official police reports 
            of accidental death and the Renfrewshire Procurator Fiscal considering 
            Annie&#146;s demise as &quot;highly suspicious&quot;; considers that 
            previous investigations into this case may not have been independent 
            or looked at all available evidence, and believes that the best way 
            to ensure that this case is resolved to the satisfaction of all parties 
            is for the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice to instigate 
            an independent inquiry to review all the evidence, details and circumstances 
            relating to Mrs Davies&#146; death.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3256</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran: Better Communities 
            in Scotland: Closing the Gap</strong>&#151;That the Parliament warmly 
            welcomes the publication of the Scottish Executive&#146;s community 
            regeneration statement <em>Better Communities in Scotland: Closing 
            the Gap</em>; agrees<em> </em>that despite past successes in community 
            regeneration more needs to be done to improve the quality of life 
            of people in Scotland&#146;s deprived areas; fully endorses the policy 
            proposals for improving public services in deprived communities, placing 
            community regeneration more firmly within the strategic framework 
            of community planning, giving more priority to community learning 
            and development and improving monitoring and evaluation, and agrees 
            that these measures will make a significant contribution to closing 
            the gap between deprived areas and the rest of Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3255</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: William Topaz 
            McGonagall</strong>&#151;That the Parliament pays tribute to the life 
            and work of William Topaz McGonagall, known as the &quot;world&#146;s 
            worst poet&quot;, on the anniversary of his death 100 years ago; recognises 
            that despite his lack of poetic talent he had a great passion for 
            poetry and for his adopted city of Dundee, and hopes that public interest 
            in his life and work will increase in this important year and that, 
            love or loathe his poetry, he is given due recognition as one of the 
            great Scottish eccentrics of the last century.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3254#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Action Plan on 
            Organic Food and Farming for Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that the sale of organic food in the UK, including Scotland, 
            is increasing faster than in any other European country; further notes 
            that Scotland is well-suited to organic food production; welcomes 
            the adoption by the devolved administrations in Wales and Northern 
            Ireland of ambitious action plans to expand organic food production, 
            the preparation of a plan by Her Majesty's Government and its support 
            for the development of a European Union plan, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should support consumers and producers by preparing 
            an action plan on organic food and farming for Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3253</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: Deferred Waiting

            the Auditor General for Scotland, <em>Review of the management of waiting 
            lists in Scotland</em>; believes that public confidence in the waiting 
            list system is at an all-time low, and considers that, for public 
            confidence to be restored, the following immediate action should be 
            taken by the government in Scotland: (a) the deferred list should 
            be abolished and a complete waiting list established in order to ascertain 
            the true number of people waiting for treatment in Scotland and (b) 
            all current and new patients whose treatment has been reclassified 
            from day case to out-patient should be given a &quot;waiting time 
            guarantee&quot; and that the guarantee should be redefined to include 
            the complete patient journey from referral by a general practitioner 
            to treatment. </p>
