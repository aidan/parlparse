<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7508 Cathy Peattie: Carers Rights Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Friday 3 December 2010 is Carers Rights Day; acknowledges and values what it considers the substantial contribution made by over 700,000 unpaid carers and young carers across Scotland; welcomes the practical and emotional support provided by the network of Princess Royal Trust for Carers Centres across Scotland; recognises what is seen as the critical work of Falkirk Carers Centre in identifying and supporting over 53,000 carers and young carers; understands that, despite what it considers their valuable work and social impact and the inclusion of &pound;5 million of Carer Information Strategy funding for NHS boards in the draft budget, carers organisations across Scotland continue to face significant funding challenges as a result of local government cuts, and believes that all parties should demonstrate their support for unpaid carers in the Parliament and in local constituencies and regions across the country as carers centres wait to hear about local core funding over the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7507 Robert Brown: Silently Stressed, NUS Scotland&rsquo;s Research on Student Stress</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the recent report from NUS Scotland on student stress, <em>Silently Stressed: a survey into student mental wellbeing,</em> which reported that student stress is on the rise, with over 90% of students feeling very stressed by examinations, 70% feeling very stressed by financial hardship and 50% feeling stressed while working in a paid job; is particularly alarmed that 40% of student counselling services surveyed were unable to meet demand from the student community and calls on Universities Scotland to ensure that student welfare and support services are adequately resourced to meet the reported increase in student stress; notes that over 80% of students surveyed felt that stigma around mental illness prevented them from seeking help, and calls for more work to be carried out on how the barrier of stigma can be overcome in encouraging students to come forward early to seek support for stress.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7506&diams;   Des McNulty: St Margaret of Scotland Hospice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the continuing uncertainty faced by Scotland&rsquo;s largest hospice as a result of proposals to remove places for the care of older people with complex needs; considers with regret that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has failed to enter into positive and constructive discussions with the board of the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice aimed at securing the future of the hospice and the retention of what is considered its outstanding provision; believes that insufficient progress is being made toward finding a solution, and would welcome the continuation of what is considered this much-valued provision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7505&diams;   Nanette Milne: Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) in its campaign to increase awareness and understanding of type 1 diabetes; notes that Scotland has the third highest incidence of type 1 diabetes in Europe; understands that only 2% of people in Scotland with type 1 diabetes have access to an insulin pump in comparison with an average of 20% in the rest of Europe; acknowledges that insulin pumps can reduce the incidence of disabling hypoglycaemia and the risk of developing diabetic complications; would welcome progress on increasing access to insulin pumps for all people with type 1 diabetes who would benefit from using one, and recognises the importance of research funded by JDRF, such as recent work at the University of Aberdeen on the role that stem cell technology might play in finding the cure for type 1 diabetes.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7504&diams;   Alison McInnes: Getabout and liftshare</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, following the first ever <em>lift</em>share week, membership of the UK-wide car-sharing network has now exceeded 400,000; further notes that car sharing, as well as bringing environmental benefits, can save participants money through shared travelling costs; congratulates <em>lift</em>share on its recent success in the Contribution to the Community category at the Nectar Small Business Awards; considers outstanding the work of Getabout, a partnership between Nestrans, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils, local universities and other organisations, in promoting better transport choices, including car sharing, in the north east, and believes that encouraging car sharing and other more sustainable transport options can play a key part in helping the transport sector to meet its share of Scotland&rsquo;s climate change reduction targets.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7503 Patrick Harvie: Shawlands Town Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the longstanding efforts of Shawlands and Strathbungo Community Council as well as residents, businesses and community groups on Glasgow&rsquo;s south side to push for the improvement of Shawlands town centre; recognises the work of the Shawlands Town Centre Steering Group, which published the results of a consultation exercise in April 2010 and which is working toward an action plan for the area; notes that the priorities identified in the consultation included the regeneration of Shawlands Arcade and better use of public space, including more greenery and facilities for a market; looks forward to the publication of the action plan and a commitment from Glasgow City Council to addressing these and other priorities; values the character of Shawlands and the diversity of local independent businesses, and hopes to see the great potential for improvement turned into a reality.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7502 Alasdair Allan: Outer Hebrides to Mexico</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the former crofter, Seumas MacDonald from South Uist, for representing the interests of threatened coastal communities around the world when he travelled to Mexico on 26 November 2010 in advance of the global UN climate change talks due to take place over the next fortnight; notes that Mr MacDonald, together with Oxfam Scotland, has raised awareness of the dangers faced by communities in Uist from coastal inundation and the wider lessons that these provide for coastal communities around the world at a time of rising sea levels; considers that, in Uist, there is a powerful example of the human as well as environmental impact of shifting coastlines and climate change, and welcomes the attention that Mr MacDonald is bringing to this issue.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7500 Alasdair Allan: BT Alba Gaelic Debate 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Iain Murdo MacMillan and Christina Louise MacLeod of the Nicolson Institute, Stornoway, on winning the final of the BT Alba Gaelic Debate 2010, held in the Scottish Parliament on 24 November; notes that Christina Louise MacLeod was also named as best debater of the competition; congratulates runner-up Millburn Academy, Inverness, on progressing so far in the competition and semi-finalists Castlebay school and Inverness Royal Academy and all other teams taking part in the competition; considers that a high standard of debate was shown throughout this year&rsquo;s competition and final, and believes that this is an excellent showcase of the skills of Scotland&rsquo;s young Gaelic speakers.</p>
