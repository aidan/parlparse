    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-68 Henry McLeish: </b>That the Parliament notes that

    privatisation of health, education, transport and other public services through the
    Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) schemes; notes the
    mounting body of evidence that PFI and PPP, introduced by the Conservative Government and
    continued by the Labour Government, are an inefficient and expensive method of funding
    vital public services which also undermine the pay and conditions of public service staff;
    calls upon the Scottish Ministers to disclose the annual expenditure commitments
    associated with each public project involving private finance, and the rate of return that
    private partners receive for the capital that they commit; urges the Scottish Ministers to
    examine alternatives to such private financing, and calls on the Scottish Ministers to
    bring forward proposals to introduce Scottish Public Service Trusts.</p>

    &quot;supports the provision of high quality health, education, transport and other public
    services; agrees that public/private partnerships will continue to be one of the ways used
    to increase innovation and investment in public services where this approach represents
    best value; calls on the Executive to continue to work to improve the operation of
    public/private partnerships and seek opportunities for new types of partnership and
    flexible contracts which will allow assets, when appropriate, to revert to public
    ownership, and recognises its use in delivering high quality public services while
    protecting the interests of the community as indicated in the <i>Partnership for Scotland.</i>&quot;</p>

    that high taxes can have on tourism and, in the light of new statistics showing a fall in
