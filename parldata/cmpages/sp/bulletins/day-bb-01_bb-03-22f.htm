            <strong>Ms Sandra White: River Clyde Improvement</strong>—That the Parliament

            in particular the society’s George Parsonage who has worked with dedication 
            on the Clyde for many years; notes however with concern that despite 
            recent improvements in water quality the Clyde still suffers from 
            pollution caused by sewage and rubbish, hindering the work of the 
            society; notes that much of the riverside is neglected, decaying and 
            overgrown, and therefore believes that consideration should be given 
            to the introduction of greater sanctions on individuals and companies 
            dumping rubbish and sewage in the river and to the setting up of a 
            national river authority consisting of representatives from the relevant 
            local authorities to ensure that the Clyde and its banks are properly 
            managed and maintained.</font></p>

            of an extra £1.9 million in grant aid for Scottish Opera in the current 
            financial year which has less than two weeks to run, and an additional 
            £1 million each year for the next three years to the company, has 
            been handled in what appears to be a rushed and irregular manner in 
            the final days of the Minister’s career in government, and calls upon 
            the First Minister to suspend payment of any additional money to Scottish 
            Opera pending an inquiry into the circumstances of the grant and its 
            announcement and, in his new capacity as the Cabinet Minister with 
            responsibility for the arts and culture, to appear before the Education,

            on the funding and operation of Scottish Opera which has now received 
            £4 million in emergency aid in less than 16 months and which appears 
            to be in blatant contempt of the key unanimous cross party recommendation 
            of the Education, Culture and Sport committee’s report into the National 
            Companies published in February 2000 which stated &quot;Any solution

            a public information campaign in relation to the disease with clearer 
            and more precise guidelines governing access to the countryside, and 
            believes that the extent of the financial difficulties now being suffered 
            is so grave that a comprehensive package of measures must be introduced 
            to assist all aspects of economic life in our rural communities.&quot;

            Sheridan: Inquiry Into Drugs Misuse and Deprived Communities</strong>—As 
            an amendment to motion (S1M-1766) in the name of Johann Lamont, <a name="AmendmentText">insert 
            at end "and welcomes the findings of the Report which, at long last, 
            have conclusively established the clear link between problematic drug 
            use and social deprivation and believes it is particularly encouraging 
            to see that for once the relationship between poverty and social exclusion 
            leading to drug misuse rather than the other way around has been identified; 
            believes that attending to the strategies of regeneration and community 
            planning in disadvantaged areas will benefit these communities far 
            more than the continued reliance on a failed policy of reducing availability; 
            further welcomes the Report’s findings which clearly state that the 
            drugs causing serious problems in communities are heroin, tranquillisers 
            and alcohol; supports the general thrust of the Report which highlights 
            the need to regenerate communities and build decent recreational and 
            sporting facilities which are accessible to all as a first priority 
            in the strategy to tackle problematic drug abuse but also recognises 
            that the Report makes it clear that criminalising drug users has failed 
            as a deterrent and has actually compounded these problems; notes that 
            it is time to recognise that drug use is a health issue and not a 
            criminal justice one and, to this end, recommends that the example 
            of other European countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, 
            Holland and Switzerland, which have all taken decisions to decriminalise 
            the personal use of cannabis, should be followed; commends the findings 
            of the Report which have established that the use of soft drugs like 
            cannabis is not a serious problem and therefore believes that the 
            licensing of the sale of cannabis would play a major role in breaking 
            the link between the sale of cannabis and heroin in communities; further 
            recognises from the Report that treatment facilities for heroin users 
            are &quot;woefully inadequate&quot; across Scotland and that necessary 
            funds are released to satisfy demand for these services and, while 
            recognising the need for a comprehensive and widely available maintenance 
            programme for recovering heroin addicts, further notes that the Report 
            has failed to investigate the potential of pharmaceutical heroin being 
            prescribed to registered heroin addicts; further recommends that a 
            fact-finding mission be sent to Switzerland to study the results of 
            clinical trials there which have been carried out on over 1,000 existing 
            heroin addicts and where the initial results are even more dramatically 
            successful than the methadone maintenance programme, in terms of stabilising 
            the lives of heroin addicts, reducing crime and stabilising the communities, 
            and recognises that the main thrust of drugs expenditure has to move 
            away from law enforcement, such as the ill-conceived Scottish Drug 
            Enforcement Agency, and into treatment, education and spending so 
            as to alleviate social deprivation.</a></font></p>
