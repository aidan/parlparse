    Parliament agrees that the regulation-making powers relating to Scotland in respect of

    Ministers. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-809#</b> <strong>Elaine Smith: Right to Respite</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes National Carers Week 2000 between 12 and 18 June; recognises the
    outstanding contribution made by thousands of Scots, including a great many constituents
    in Coatbridge and Chryston, who provide care for sick or disabled family or friends; notes
    the on-going commitment by the Scottish Executive to assist those who find themselves in a
    caring role; notes the difficulties encountered with the provision of respite care to
    carers and the cared for, and believes that a &quot;Right to Respite&quot; should be
    enshrined for all.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-808#</b> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Shinty</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    recognises the importance of shinty as Scotland&#146;s indigenous sport; notes that,

    inclusion, citizenship, healthy living, community development, volunteering and economic
    development; welcomes the comprehensive presentation made by the Camanachd Association to
    MSPs on 3 May 2000, and supports the Association&#146;s case for enhanced funding from the

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-807</b> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Gourock-Dunoon Ferry Service</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Executive&#146;s proposal that the CalMac
    ferry route from Gourock-Dunoon become a &quot;passenger only&quot; service; recognises
    the massive additional subsidy that would be required to make good the shortfall in
    revenue created through the loss of vehicular business; acknowledges the profound concern
    of local businesses in Dunoon that such a measure would hinder the economic growth of the
    town; expresses concern about the capacity of the alternative private operator to maintain
    the current frequency of service offered through the availability of both public and
    private ferry operators, and reaffirms its belief that the Scottish Executive should make
    representations to the European Commission to guarantee no diminution of ferry services to
    Dunoon.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-806#</b> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Malawi</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    welcomes the visit by the President of Malawi; recognises the historical and present day
    links between our two nations; acknowledges the commitment to democracy and human rights
    by the government of Malawi; applauds its efforts to improve the social and economic
    wellbeing of the people of Malawi despite the debt burden accumulated by the previous
    regime, and urges the Scottish Executive to act on the plea by the President to encourage
    medical students and doctors to go to Malawi and to make urgent representations to Her
    Majesty's Government to encourage the write off the burden of debt on this nation, which
    is one of the poorest in the world. </p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-805</b> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Local Veterinary Inspector Fees:
    Competitive Tendering</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the pilot exercise by the
    Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the area covering Lancashire, Cheshire,
    Greater Manchester and Merseyside to subject routine TB testing, the collection of blood
    samples for brucellosis and brucellosis abortion enquiries to competitive tendering;
    recognises that the current local veterinary inspector system plays an invaluable role in
    animal welfare; notes that any alteration to that system may erode the relationship
    between client producer and the local veterinary inspector, and calls upon the Scottish
    Executive not to introduce such a system within Scotland without an exhaustive evaluation
    of the pilot exercise and full consultation with the industry. <i><strong>R</strong></i></p>
