<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3568</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Operation Fleet</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of Operation Fleet, by Strathclyde Police, in the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area; notes the impressive results of Operation Fleet, including five people arrested for posing with offensive weapons on internet sites and encouraging people to join them in violent acts, 16 arrested under warrant and 21 arrested for offences such as carrying an offensive weapon and assault; welcomes the fact that no offences were detected in 228 visits to licensed premises to ensure compliance with licensing laws; notes that the success of Operation Fleet depended on partnership working, using measures between Strathclyde Police, North Lanarkshire Council and local businesses, putting into effect measures introduced in the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 and Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004, and hopes that the current Scottish Executive continues this commitment to effective&nbsp;community policing by providing forces with the tools that they need to deliver stronger and safer communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3567</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>SNP Fails Dumbarton Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Labour group of West Dunbartonshire Council to set a budget that included funding to enable a much-needed rebuilding of Dumbarton Academy; considers that the rebuilding of this 500-year-old school should be a priority; expresses considerable disappointment and anger that the SNP-led council failed even to consider the Labour group&rsquo;s proposals and voted against the rebuilding of the school; further expresses concern that, if the school is not rebuilt quickly, it will disadvantage thousands of young children in Dumbarton who are currently being denied access to the best educational environment possible, and therefore calls on the SNP to build a new Dumbarton Academy without any further delay.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3566</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s Contempt for Consultation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision taken by the board of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to remove 24/7 anaesthetics service, coronary care, treatment for strokes, gastrointestinal bleeds and epileptic seizures from the Vale of Leven Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RHA) in Paisley; further regrets the decision to close the Christie Ward, which provides invaluable inpatient acute mental health services to the local community; considers that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has displayed utter contempt for the views of the local community; strongly considers that insufficient attention has been given to a reconfiguration of services based north of the river; further notes that this decision is not keeping services local, as promised by the Scottish Government, and therefore calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to reject these proposals, retain 24/7 anaesthetics and the Christie Ward at the Vale of Leven Hospital and reconfigure services currently delivered by the RAH to be delivered north of the river for an enhanced catchment area.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3565</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Perfect Pupils</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ashley-Leigh Robertson and Rasiba Norin, the two Dumbarton Academy pupils who attained 100% in their higher modern studies papers; acknowledges that they are the first two pupils from the same school ever to achieve such a feat; recognises the hard work of both girls who gained a further four highers each; further recognises that this achievement is a positive reflection on the teaching staff at Dumbarton Academy and the area as a whole, and wishes both girls long and successful careers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3564</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>The Draft Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee recommends that the draft Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2009 be approved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3563</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Strathclyde Police Prolific Offender Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Strathclyde Police on the success of the Prolific Offender Programme, aimed specifically at drug and alcohol offenders, which has resulted in a 30% reduction in offending rates, particularly regarding shop lifting, housebreaking and prostitution; welcomes the inclusion of counselling, education and housing opportunities as part of the rehabilitation process under this pioneering initiative aimed at improving community safety, and notes that since 2007 over 194 people have been involved in the initiative while 95 people remain engaged in the programme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3562</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Furniture Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the Glasgow Furniture Initiative, which, after recycling unwanted domestic furniture and white goods, provides a one-stop-shop for Glasgow&rsquo;s social welfare and housing agencies to supply furnishings for households on low incomes; welcomes the many benefits of the initiative, such as recycling goods previously sent to landfill, reducing levels of repeat homelessness and providing training opportunities for people previously affected by homelessness, and hopes that this initiative will go from strength to strength.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3561</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Medical Student Top-up Fees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that medical students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland studying at Scottish universities pay an additional fee of &pound;1,075 compared to students studying other subjects; believes that students should not have to choose what they study based on how much it costs, and calls on the Scottish Government to scrap this top-up fee for medical students at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3560</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Confucius Classroom</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Our Lady&rsquo;s High School in Cumbernauld on the public launch of&nbsp;its Confucius Classroom Hub; recognises the commitment of staff and pupils to deliver and gain knowledge of the language and culture of China; welcomes the close links developed with Clyde Union, which&nbsp;has strong business links with China; recognises that the facilities provided in the Confucius Classroom Hub are made available to the wider community; encourages the work&nbsp;of Our Lady&rsquo;s High School and Clyde Union to establish work experience programmes designed to give young people an insight into their work in Scotland&nbsp;and China, and recognises the long-term benefits that&nbsp;this will have for Our Lady&rsquo;s High school pupils and the wider community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3559&diams; </strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Future of the Sunday Mail and Daily Record</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of Trinity Mirror to merge the editorial content of the Daily Record and Sunday Mail with the loss of up to 30% of journalistic staff, based primarily in Glasgow and the West of Scotland; recognises that both newspapers are an integral part of Scottish culture and that to diminish their individual identities would be a serious blow to the diversity, vibrancy and quality of the Scottish media; believes that the loss of their separate identities would undoubtedly lead to the erosion of circulation at both titles, leading inevitably to further job losses; considers that Trinity Mirror is highly profitable and that there is no need to undertake such drastic restructuring, and therefore very much hopes that good sense may prevail over the future of two of Scotland&rsquo;s leading titles.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3558</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Scrapping of Midlothian Bus Services by First</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the scrapping, with effect from 20 April 2009, of over 700 bus journeys per week between Edinburgh and Midlothian by First; deplores the fact that this will significantly reduce public transport provision for communities including Gorebridge, Newtongrange, Bonnyrigg, Eskbank, Rosewell and Newton Village; regrets the lack of consultation with the affected communities prior to the announcement; considers that these changes underline the need for communities to have more of a say in the provision of bus services, and believes that there is a strong case for the re-regulation of local bus services if market forces are unable to meet public aspirations for those services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3557</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Keep the Post Public</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Royal Mail Group third-quarter results show revenue of &pound;2.6 billion, up from &pound;2.5 billion last year, with all four businesses in profit, year-to-date profit of &pound;255 million compared to &pound;162 million for the whole of 2007-08 and full-year profits expected nearly to double; considers that profits would be higher were it not for the uncompetitive conditions under which the Royal Mail delivers mail for rival companies; notes opposition from businesses and the public towards privatisation, with opinion polls showing public support for privatisation as low as 3%; notes the importance of the universal service obligation to the social and economic wellbeing of Scotland; endorses the call for a new relationship between management and postal unions and welcomes the commitment of the Communication Workers Union to negotiate an agreement that would support the modernisation of the industry; observes that in 2007 the UK Government agreed to a &pound;1.2 billion loan facility on commercial terms to modernise Royal Mail operations but that two years later only half of this money has been spent; welcomes the recommendations in the Hooper Report that the UK Government should take responsibility for the pensions deficit that followed an extended contributions holiday; recognises that the global financial situation has exacerbated the pension fund problems, but believes that, if these can be addressed to facilitate partial privatisation, then they can be addressed to facilitate keeping the otherwise profitable Royal Mail publicly owned, and further believes that the best way to protect the universal service obligation, including six days a week delivery, is to keep the post public.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3556</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Fair Pay for Statutory Redundancies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the huge bonuses and salaries paid to senior staff in banking and financial services; believes that the pension payment to Sir Fred Goodwin is wrong and that failure should not be rewarded; notes with concern the financial difficulties being faced across the country by workers who have lost their jobs, and supports those MPs calling for a review of the current cap on statutory redundancy pay with an early uplift and a mechanism to link it to average weekly earnings.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3555</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Fred Goodwin&rsquo;s Pension</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the pension payment to Sir Fred Goodwin is wrong and that failure should not be rewarded and further believes that steps should be taken to have this pension stopped and that any payment to Sir Fred Goodwin should be brought into line with the compensation available to ordinary employees at the Royal Bank of Scotland who face unemployment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3554</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Running Out of Time - Support for Elderly Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Running Out of Time campaign, launched by ENABLE Scotland to highlight the needs of older carers of people with learning disabilities; recognises the huge pressure on these carers and the fears that they have about what will happen to their children when they, their carers, die or are no longer able to care; supports ENABLE&rsquo;s call for action by local authorities and the Scottish Government to identify elderly carers, and urges the Scottish Government to meet the key demands of the Running Out of Time campaign for better support now for older carers and help for them to plan for the future and put something in place for their sons or daughters so that&nbsp;older carers can have peace of mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>*S3M-3553</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Excellent Chryston Primary School HMIe Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Chryston Primary School for achieving an excellent evaluation in the recent HM Inspectorate of Education report in which the encouraging work of both staff and children is recognised and the commitment to maintaining current standards is celebrated; notes the success of recent events in expanding the learning experiences of children, and highlights the improvements in service that continue to be in line with the Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3552</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Release of Iraq War Minutes Vetoed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Secretary of State for Justice, Jack Straw MP, to veto the release of UK Government cabinet minutes that relate to the legality of the decision of the UK Government to go to war with Iraq in 2003; believes that the decision to veto the request of the Information Tribunal undermines the credibility of freedom of information laws, and further believes that the UK Government should launch a full inquiry into the legality of the decision to go to war with Iraq.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3551</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Stop the Part-privatisation of Royal Mail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the proposals by the UK Government to part-privatise the Royal Mail; supports the vision of a wholly publicly owned and integrated Royal Mail Group; believes that the current universal service obligation offered by Royal Mail, including six days a week delivery, must be protected and that the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals risk fracturing one of the most important public services in the country; notes that over 150 MPs have indicated their opposition to these plans by supporting an early day motion; further believes that the Post Office and Royal Mail have suffered enough from a commercial and profiteering approach to what is, in reality, a vital piece of national infrastructure, and calls on the UK Government to abandon its plans for selling any part of the Royal Mail Group into private hands.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3550</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Clentry Nursery School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly congratulates Clentry Nursery School in Kelty, Fife, for the excellent HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) report that it has received; notes that Clentry Nursery School received three excellent and two very good ratings; further notes that HMIE identified several particular strengths, including the nursery&rsquo;s leadership, the school ethos and children&rsquo;s varied and exciting outdoor learning experiences; recognises the dedicated and caring staff who are committed to the wellbeing of children and parents in both the nursery and wider community, and acknowledges the success of the nursery since its opening in 1951 in caring for generations of Kelty&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3549</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>A82, Kilbowie Roundabout</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing problems being experienced due to increasing traffic flows at the Kilbowie roundabout on the A82, causing particularly severe congestion at peak hours in the Hardgate area; welcomes the steps being taken by West Dunbartonshire Council and its partners to come up with the most appropriate engineering solution, and urges Scottish ministers to provide funding for the necessary works, bearing in mind undertakings given at the time that tolls were removed from the Erskine Bridge that ministers would ensure that necessary upgrades to key junctions on the A82, as a consequence of increased flows arising from the removal of tolls, would be given priority in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s transport programme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3548&diams; </strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Community Service Volunteers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Community Service Volunteers (CSV) for its strong track record in supporting retired people to engage with their local communities as volunteers; congratulates the CSV-RSVP (Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme) voluntary drivers project in West Dunbartonshire, which organises the pick-up and return to their homes of elderly people and other patients who would otherwise be unable to attend local health clinics and hospitals; notes that direct government funding for this and other similar volunteering schemes ends in March 2009; expresses grave concern that local authorities across Scotland are not making financial provision for these services to continue despite Scottish ministers advising projects to seek funding through community planning partnerships, and would welcome the provision of suitable financial support to ensure that the work of well-used and successful projects, including CSV-RSVP in West Dunbartonshire, can continue.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3546</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Wood News is Good News</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of &pound;870,000 in Scottish Government funding that is to benefit over 20 urban woodland projects across Scotland, including a community event that is to take place at Heathcote Avenue, Drumchapel, during National Tree Week and the Drumchapel Woodland Group, which has received &pound;3,700 in order to take on a part-time volunteer coordinator; notes the importance of such projects in boosting the sense of pride and community in local areas, and commends the ongoing hard work and commitment of all those involved in such projects.</p>
