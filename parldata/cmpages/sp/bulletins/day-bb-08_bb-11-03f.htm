<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2809</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Balochistan Earthquake</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deepest sympathy for the victims of the earthquake affecting Pakistan&rsquo;s south-west province of Balochistan, which took place on Wednesday 29 October 2008; recognises that many hundreds have lost their lives, with over 50,000 thought to be homeless; congratulates Islamic Relief for being one of the first charities on the ground to start distributing aid and building shelter for the tens of thousands facing temperatures of minus six degrees, and sends best wishes and thoughts and to the delegation of aid workers from the United Kingdom, headed by Islamic Relief&rsquo;s Scotland Fundraiser, Habib Malik, setting out to the worst affected areas in Balochistan.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2808</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>65 Years of Piping Excellence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the College of Piping in Glasgow on its 65th anniversary year in 2009; acknowledges the importance of the college in teaching people of all ages and from all backgrounds since 27 October 1944; notes that it also welcomes students from around the world, and further congratulates the college for being the oldest piping educational establishment in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2807</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>South Primary, Paisley</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that South Primary School in Paisley is being considered for closure by Renfrewshire Council; recognises the level of commitment from the teaching staff and parents at South Primary; further recognises the positive HM Inspectorate of Education report in September 2008 commending the school&rsquo;s strengths, including attainment in mathematics, the strong sense of staff teamwork and staff commitment to the care and welfare of all pupils, high quality accommodation, which provided a stimulating learning environment, very positive relationships with parents, the wider community and a range of agencies, which supported pupils&rsquo; learning; believes that the closure will result in larger class sizes for those schools that will have to absorb the displacement of pupils from South Primary; understands the anxiety that this proposed decision will cause pupils, parents and staff; regrets the educational budget cut proposals within Renfrewshire Council, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the education needs of the children who attend South Primary and, indeed, across the whole of Renfrewshire are safeguarded.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2806</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>EU Council of Ministers Call for Action on Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the acknowledgement by the Council of the European Union that Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is a European priority; agrees that Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is a major challenge for all European societies; notes that the council has acknowledged the importance of better understanding, detecting, preventing and finally combating the mechanisms that trigger neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s; further notes that the council has recognised the value of strengthening co-operation, co-ordination and financial support for research efforts across Europe; acknowledges that the current EU Presidency has also made a commitment to Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to amend its European priorities to include action on Alzheimer&rsquo;s as a key priority area and to work with key Scottish stakeholders to recognise the contribution that Scotland can make to developing innovative approaches to neurodegenerative disease Europe-wide.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2768#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Lloyds TSB Takeover of HBOS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament gives a general welcome to the measures taken by the UK and other governments to tackle the current banking crisis; considers, however, that the recapitalisation plans announced by HM Treasury in October 2008 have fundamentally changed the landscape under which competition rules were waived to enable a merger between Lloyds TSB and Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS); further considers that inconsistent statements have come from the Treasury about whether or not the banks would independently have access to the recapitalisation funds; believes that this ambiguity is not serving anyone&rsquo;s interests in the present environment; further believes that losing HBOS corporate headquarters and jobs in Edinburgh would seriously jeopardise the city&rsquo;s position as a financial centre; sees no reason why HBOS should not be able to access UK Treasury recapitalisation and, therefore, liquidity funding on the same independent basis as other major banks, and, with this in mind, considers it a very real possibility that an independent HBOS solution could be found that may well be in the best interests of shareholders, employees, customers and the Scottish economy at large.</p>
