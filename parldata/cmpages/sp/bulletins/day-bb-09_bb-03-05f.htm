<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3617</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Snaring in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that it is now a full year since the previous Minister for Environment announced his intention not to ban snares but to create further regulations to govern their use; recognises that the proposed regulations have not yet appeared; considers that, even with regulation, the continued use of snaring will subject thousands of Scotland&rsquo;s animals every year to distress and suffering, including disembowelment, mutilation and death by slow strangulation, which is unacceptable and could not legally be inflicted on domestic animals; also considers that indiscriminate trapping methods such as snares exact a heavy toll of non-target animals including wildlife, pets and farmed animals; is concerned that snares are still used to catch protected mountain hares; recognises that the Scottish Executive consultation on the future of snaring in 2006 elicited a more than two-to-one majority in favour of an outright ban on snares and that a poll commissioned in October 2008 showed that 79% of the Scottish public thought that snares should be banned, and therefore fully supports the campaign by Advocates for Animals, the League Against Cruel Sports and other wildlife organisations in calling for urgent action including a complete ban on snares in Scotland.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3616</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Loreburn Housing Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Loreburn Housing Association from Dumfries and Galloway on being named by <em>The Sunday Times</em> as one of the top 10 companies in the United Kingdom for making a positive difference to the world and on being one of only two housing associations and one of only three Scottish companies included in its list of the top 100 Best Small Companies to Work For in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3615&diams; </strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Childhood and Sport-related Injuries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the lack of data available in Scotland on childhood and sport-related injuries; understands, however, that Scotland has signed up to the Child Safety Action Plan, part of the European Commission&rsquo;s public health programme that will provide an opportunity to address child safety; observes that Sweden, with its child injury and surveillance system, has the lowest rates of injury and the highest levels of sports activity in Europe, as well as obesity rates half that of the United Kingdom; notes the partnership between NHS Lothian and the Scottish Rugby Union, and hopes that this and similar initiatives to increase sport participation across deprived communities will include provision for surveillance and monitoring of injuries.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3614</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Marine and Coastal Access Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the UK Marine and Coastal Access Bill introduced in the House of Lords on 4 December 2008, relating to the marine policy statement, marine planning, marine licensing, marine conservation zones and enforcement powers, so far as these matters fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, or alter the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3613</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Women&rsquo;s Environmental Network</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Women&rsquo;s Environmental Network aims to empower women to make positive environmental change, increase awareness of women&rsquo;s perspectives on environmental issues and influence decision-making to achieve environmental justice for women; further notes the publication of <em>Gender and Environmental Chemicals</em>, a scoping study to identify key gender-related issues for international policy-making on chemicals management and safety, commissioned by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which recommends how best to have a gender perspective and input to environmental policy and processes; recognises that the biological, physiological and sociological differences between men and women need to be taken into account when considering how exposure to chemicals in the environment may affect them; considers that a gender equality approach needs to be taken to protect women&rsquo;s health and help women participate more in environmental decisions about policies, processes and forums; believes that it is essential that women are brought into the mainstream of environmental decision-making processes, whether community-based or those initiated by governments; is concerned that new research shows that environmental and occupational exposures to toxins are contributing, or suspected of contributing, to a range of serious health problems in humans, as well as in many other species, and in particular notes the evidence of problems arising from early exposures, pre-natally and in infancy; notes that in view of the strength of evidence for the hormone-disrupting actions of BisphenolA (BPA), several US States, Canada and several commercial firms have voluntarily withdrawn products containing BPA; believes that, as a precautionary measure, polycarbonate plastic baby-feeding bottles and other drinks bottles should be removed from sale, and further believes that a toxic use reduction programme should be considered.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3612</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Clydebank Citizen of the Year 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Phyllis Gillan on receiving the prestigious accolade of Clydebank Citizen of the Year 2009; applauds her immense contribution and dedication to the tenants&rsquo; and residents&rsquo; association in her home village of Duntocher and in the Clydebank area, and welcomes the recognition of a lifetime of work dedicated to her community that this honour brings.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3611#</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Supporting Town Centres</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the central role that high streets play in local communities and town centres as a focal point for both economic and social activity, especially in the south of Scotland region; believes that high streets and town centres must be supported and invested in during the current economic downturn; notes calls from the Local Government Association in England to allow local authorities to temporarily use vacant high street shops as sites for community projects; welcomes the cross-party support for a Town Centre Regeneration Fund in the recent budget, and looks forward to the improvements that this will generate in high streets and town centres across Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3610</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Shelter&rsquo;s Edinburgh Families Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses both concern and regret over the closure of the highly successful Edinburgh Families Project, which was set up and run by the charity, Shelter, from 1998; notes that this project was the first of its kind in Scotland that delivered intensive support specifically to meet the needs of families struggling to leave behind a history of homelessness or families at risk of homelessness; further notes that a unique aspect of the project was its separate support and advocacy for children and young people through working with child-support workers qualified in drama, art or play therapy; recognises that this project transformed the lives of 415 families, directly helping around 800 children, during its 10-year history; wishes the staff from the project well in finding alternative employment, and believes that the Scottish Government must consider the impact of losing such a valuable homelessness prevention project at the time when the target of ending homelessness by 2012 looms large and must also ensure that housing and homelessness services, support and provision are properly resourced and delivered throughout Scotland as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3609.1</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government Failures</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3609) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish Government to concentrate its efforts on economic recovery and abandon its divisive plans for a Referendum Bill for the remainder of its term of office.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3609.2</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government Failures</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3609) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from &quot;SNP manifesto&quot; and insert &quot;the SNP manifesto included a commitment to a referendum on Scottish independence within the lifetime of this Parliament but believes that there should be a campaign to educate the electorate as to the differences between the devolved powers exercised by the Scottish Parliament and the reserved powers exercised by the UK Parliament before people in Scotland are asked to make a choice for or against a transfer of power from one legislature to the other.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3609.3</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government Failures</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3609) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;commends the Scottish Government&rsquo;s record of achievement since May 2007; believes that the benefits to the Scottish people of lower council tax bills, lower business rates, lower prescription charges and a return to free education are reflected in the SNP&rsquo;s excellent poll ratings; notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s&nbsp;six-point economic recovery plan that is providing much-needed assistance during Labour&rsquo;s recession; believes, however, that additional economic powers for the Scottish Parliament, in particular borrowing powers, are essential to steer the Scottish economy out of recession and thereafter to support economic growth; condemns the &pound;500 million in&nbsp;cuts that the UK Labour government plans to impose on the Scottish budget in 2010-11 and 2011-12, which&nbsp;will cost more than 8,000 jobs and represents a serious threat to economic recovery; calls on all parties with Scotland&rsquo;s interests at heart to oppose these cuts, and looks forward to continuing a lively debate and National Conversation about Scotland&rsquo;s future.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3607*&diams;</strong>* <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>60th Anniversary of NATO</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 4 April 2009 marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO); recognises that the continued presence of NATO serves as a destabilising factor in the West&rsquo;s relationship with Russia; notes that NATO relies heavily on the continued use of nuclear weapons as part of its operational capacity; recalls that the first Secretary General of NATO, Lord Ismay, described the organisation&rsquo;s purpose as being &quot;to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down&quot;; further recognises that the world has fundamentally changed since the founding of NATO in 1949, and, given that the Cold War is meant to be over, believes that the organisation has no useful purpose in the modern world.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3584.1.1</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>National Planning Framework for Scotland 2 - Proposed Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-3584.1) in the name of David McLetchie, insert at end &quot;and reaffirms that in accordance with paragraph 152 of the National Planning Framework for Scotland 2 proposed framework document it does not support the construction of new nuclear power stations in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3584.2</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>National Planning Framework for Scotland 2 - Proposed Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3584) in the name of Duncan McNeil, insert at end &quot;supports the inclusion of the high-speed rail link between Scotland and London on the list of designated national developments; recommends that the Scottish Government ensures that both interim and long-term targets for reducing emissions are fully taken into account in land use and energy policies, and considers that local and national land use planning must facilitate walking and cycling in urban as well as rural areas.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3584.3</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>National Planning Framework for Scotland 2 - Proposed Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3584) in the name of Duncan McNeil, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that the Local Government and Communities Committee&rsquo;s 5th Report, 2009 (Session 3): <em>National Planning Framework for Scotland 2: Proposed Framework </em>(SP Paper 218), expresses no view on the inclusion of the proposed national developments; notes that the national developments proposed in the document include new coal-fired power stations, increased capacity for road traffic and provisions for increased air traffic at three Scottish airports; rejects these developments that will result in dramatic increases in greenhouse gas emissions, alongside many other forms of social and environmental impact; recognises that the designation of a national development will prevent people from objecting on the grounds of need during later stages of the planning process; notes the unanimous recommendation of the Communities Committee in its 5th Report, 2006 (Session 2): <em>Stage 1 Report on the Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill</em> (SP Paper 552) that the National Planning Framework should be &quot;the subject of a debate in the Parliament on a substantive motion&quot;, and therefore considers that the Scottish Government should bring forward a further motion to the Parliament, explicitly seeking endorsement for each of the proposed national developments before the final version of the National Planning Framework is adopted by Ministers.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3573</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>The Post Office,  A People&rsquo;s Bank</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the confidence that the public has in the Post Office, particularly in this period of financial uncertainty; further notes the value of post offices in communities across Scotland; believes that, in providing a further range of financial services, the Post Office could assist many of those whom the banks do not serve, and further believes that, by becoming a people&rsquo;s bank, the Post Office could make a significant contribution to social inclusion and financial stability in Scotland.</p>
