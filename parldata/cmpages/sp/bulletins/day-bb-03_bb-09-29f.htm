          <P><strong>*S2M-420</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>UNISON's 
            NHS Food for Good Charter</strong>-That the Parliament endorses UNISON 
            Scotland's <em>NHS</em> <em>Food for Good Charter </em>and believes 
            that the charter represents a model for how public sector catering 
            should address issues of public health promotion, environmental sustainability 
            and animal welfare.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-419</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Hearts 
            FC and its Welcome to Bosnian Refugees</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the decision by Hearts FC to give free tickets to Bosnian 
            refugees living in Edinburgh for the game between Hearts and NK Zeljeznicar; 
            further welcomes the opportunity refugees had to be involved in an 
            event in their community and meet the football players; congratulates 
            the Community Help and Advice Initiative charity for their work with 
            refugees, and calls on Scottish football clubs to make the most of 
            similar opportunities for involving members of the local community 
            when playing European ties.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-418</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Ayr

            the <em>Ayr Advertiser</em>, Scotland's oldest weekly newspaper, on

            Mail Withdrawal from Use of Rail</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with deep regret that the movement of mail by rail is due to end in 
            Scotland on 30 September 2003; condemns the decision by Royal Mail 
            earlier this year that brought this situation, which threatens the 
            future of 500 jobs across the United Kingdom, about; recognises that 
            the decision undermines the policy of the Scottish Executive which 
            seeks to promote the increased use of freight on rail; notes with 
            dismay that increased congestion and pollution will result from the 
            extra lorry miles on the road network, and considers that the Executive 
            should make further representations to Her Majesty's Government with 
            a view to persuading Royal Mail to reverse its decision.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-416#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Sexual 
            Health Strategy</strong>-That the Parliament awaits with interest 
            consultation on the Scottish Executive's Sexual Health Strategy; recognises 
            that a holistic approach across the whole spectrum of sexual health 
            is required and that a raft of measures will be necessary, and is 
            concerned to ensure that the Executive will include in its proposals 
            a commitment to provide free emergency contraception at all current 
            outlets, increase availability across the board and ensure easy access 
            for schoolchildren to professional advice and support and emergency 
            contraception, supported by measures to address the reasons for young 
            people commencing early sexual relationships, given the large numbers 
            of people who report negative experiences.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-415</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Water 
            Charging Schemes</strong>-That the Parliament endorses the recommendation 
            of the Water Customer Consultation Panel's report <em>Principles of 
            Charging for Water and Wastewater</em> that &quot;the current household 
            charge reduction scheme for low income households should be extended 
            beyond March 2004&quot; and believes that such a scheme should be 
            funded accordingly and extended with a view to expanding its scope 
            to assist many more of those living in poverty.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-414</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>The 
            Sun Newspaper and Frank Bruno</strong>-That the Parliament condemns 
            the ignorant and stigmatising headline by <em>The Sun</em> on Tuesday 
            23 September 2003, which reported on the ex-boxer Frank Bruno who 
            was sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 in England; deplores 
            the damage that this kind of extreme and ill-judged use of words can 
            do both to those suffering from mental illness and to anti-stigma 
            campaigns, and calls upon <em>The Sun</em> to extend its redress beyond 
            the current appeal campaign to provide a platform for long running 
            anti-stigma campaigns such as the &quot;See Me&quot; campaign.</P>

            Report 2003: Mainstreaming Equal Opportunities in the Work of Committees 
            of the Scottish Parliament-That the Parliament notes the recommendations 
            contained in the Equal Opportunities Committee's 1st Report 2003: 
            <em>Mainstreaming Equal Opportunities in the Work of Committees of 
            the Scottish Parliament</em> (SP Paper 817).</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-408</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Solidarity 
            with Pensioners Protesting about Council Tax in England</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the pensioners in the West Country who 
            are protesting at the steep council tax rises in England; sends a 
            message of solidarity to their campaign for non-payment of the unfair 
            and regressive council tax; notes that the Liberal Democrat conference 
            on 23 September 2003 called for the abolition of the council tax and 
            its replacement by an income-based system, and calls on the Scottish 
            Liberal Democrat part of the coalition in the Scottish Executive to 
            initiate this policy in Scotland.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-407</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Criminal 
            Justice Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament agrees 
            that, in addition to the provisions referred to in motion S1M-3671, 
            those further matters which have been brought forward in the Criminal 
            Justice Bill and that relate to devolved matters should be considered

          <P><strong>S2M-405</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Army 
            Display in the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its 
            opposition to the army display at the reception area in Parliamentary 
            Headquarters on 23 September 2003; notes that since defence is a reserved 
            matter there is therefore no reason for a display by the army in the 
            Parliament; feels very strongly that the time is not suitable because 
            of the humanitarian and political disaster in Iraq, with parents of 
            young men and women serving there wondering whether their children 
            will come home alive; questions why there is a recruitment display 
            by the army when other companies are not permitted to advertise in 
            the Parliament, and considers that the invitation to the army to display 
            in the Parliament should be withdrawn immediately and not be repeated.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-405.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Army

            to end and insert &quot;support for the army recruiting and information 
            stall in the foyer of the Parliament HQ building; welcomes the promotion 
            of military service as a career option for our young people, equipping 
            them with vital skills which will be of use in later life, and pays 
            tribute to the selfless service of our troops in defending our national 
            interest and our freedoms over many years and most recently in Iraq.&quot;</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-382</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Deepcut 
            Barracks Public Inquiry</strong>-That the Parliament fully supports 
            the call from the parents of the four young men killed in suspicious 
            circumstances since 1995 at the Deepcut Army Barracks in Aldershot 
            for a full and independent public inquiry into their deaths and believes 
            that the police and army investigations to date have been totally 
            inadequate and the results have been politically biased against justice 
            and truth.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-378#</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Mandatory 
            20 MPH Zones</strong>-That the Parliament considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should make 20 mph speed zones mandatory within a 250m radius 
            of schools and hospitals, throughout residential areas and on motorway/dual 
            carriageway off-ramps.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-377</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Imprisonment

            condemns the High Court in Dublin for jailing Socialist Party TD Joe 
            Higgins and Socialist Party County Councillor Clare Daly for one month 
            for their part in leading a popular campaign of non-payment of refuse 
            collection taxes imposed by Fingal County Council; believes that in 
            supporting this campaign these politicians have only been carrying 
            out their duty as elected representatives of the people in opposing 
            and protesting against this tax, which is perceived as a stealth tax 
            on the poor in working class housing estates in the north of Dublin, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the 
            Irish Parliament to try to secure the immediate release of Joe Higgins 
            and Clare Daly.</P>

            of Coca-Cola</strong>-That the Parliament supports the international 
            boycott of Coca-Cola, launched by the Colombian trade union federation 
            Central Unitaria de Trabajadores de Colombia (CUT) and supported by 
            the World Social Forum in Brazil, to highlight the murder of eight 
            trade union leaders at Coca-Cola bottling plants in Colombia, and 
            considers that people across Scotland should boycott Coca-Cola as 
            part of the international campaign to force this multinational company 
            to pay compensation to the families of those murdered, assist in bringing 
            the assassins to court and guarantee trade union and human rights

          <P> <strong>S2M-375</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Recruitment 
            Policy for Children's Panels</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            that the current recruitment policy for children's panel members currently 
            requires refusal of applications from those in the 60 and over age 
            group and calls on the Scottish Executive to review this policy.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-374</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Common 
            Ridings</strong>-That the Parliament supports the time-honoured informal 
            arrangements whereby local police in the Scottish Borders temporarily 
            hold up traffic while roads and streets are occupied in connection 
            with the common ridings; notes that these festivals are seen by some 
            police officers as an excellent opportunity for proactive community 
            policing; notes that routes, timings and consequent road closures 
            are traditional and therefore well known to residents and visitors; 
            notes that this arrangement has worked well for decades; notes the 
            current pressure from the Scottish Executive to formalise these arrangements 
            for trunk roads since management of these roads was privatised and 
            considers that the case for such formalisation is not proven; notes 
            that the proposals in the draft guidance document were the result 
            of consultation between Amey Highways Ltd, Dumfries and Galloway Council 
            and police and excluded Scottish Borders representatives and, according 
            to the Scottish Borders Council, "contains a number of errors and 
            flaws"; notes that implementation of these requirements will place 
            a significant financial burden on Scottish Borders Council, and therefore 
            urges the Executive to reconsider these proposals after full consultation 
            with Scottish Borders Council, the local police and all other interested 
            parties.</P>

            Week takes place between 27 September and 3 October 2003, including 
            Older Persons' Day on 1 October; welcomes the activities across Scotland 
            that recognise and celebrate the contribution of older people to our 
            society; congratulates local authorities such as the City of Edinburgh 
            Council in the partnership work which has produced a city plan for 
            older people; welcomes the strategic aims outlined in <em>A City for 
            All Ages</em> to improve opportunities and access to services and 
            tackle discrimination, and considers that the Scottish Executive should

            Scottish people, many of whom regard Dungavel as a prison for asylum 
            seekers and their children and wish it to be closed down altogether; 
            notes with alarm that Premier Security, the private company contracted 
            to run Dungavel, must have been privy to these plans before democratically 
            elected MSPs were informed of them; assumes, therefore, that Her Majesty's 
            Government is not serious about devolution, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should stand up to the government in Westminster 
            and take charge of the situation with a view to closing down Dungavel 
            at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

            beginning 22 September 2003 is National Road Safety week with the 
            theme of child pedestrians;&nbsp;notes that in 2002 there were 2,767 
            child casualties of which 523 were fatalities or seriously injured 
            of which 14 died; notes that 1,308 child pedestrians were casualties, 
            accounting for 39% of all pedestrian casualties of all ages and that, 
            of this number, 336 were fatalities or seriously injured of which 
            12 died; notes that 929 were child casualties in cars, of whom 111 
            were fatalities or seriously injured and two died; notes that 276 
            were child pedal cyclist casualties, 33% of the total and, of these, 
            46 had serious injuries; notes that Brake produces action packs for 
            schools, community groups and others with information on how to become 
            involved in this week's campaign but, above all, emphasises that there 
            is no substitute for driving safely at an appropriate speed particularly 
            in areas where there are likely to be children, whether as pedestrians, 
            cyclists or at play.</P>

            in the Entente Florale, Europe in Bloom, competition for 2003 held 
            in Slovenia on 20 September 2003 and notes that this tops seven consecutive 
            years of success in Scottish, British and world floral competitions 
            and ensures that the volunteers, who have transformed the image of 
            the town of Alness from depression to vibrancy, have won many new 
            friends across Europe for their sustained achievements, including

            commends NHS Argyll and Clyde for initiating regular briefings between 
            itself and MSPs to improve communication links; notes that West of 
            Scotland Labour MSPs have, for the second time, demanded that they 
            have a separate meeting with NHS officials, including the Chief Executive, 
            thereby incurring additional costs; further notes the financial situation 
            of NHS Argyll and Clyde which recently announced £13.2 million of 
            cuts and also recommended the reduction of maternity services within 
            its locality, and calls upon West of Scotland Labour MSPs to end their 
            system of separate briefings regarding NHS Argyll and Clyde, refrain 
            from such demands in the future and allow the board to operate one 
            single briefing, which will allocate them more time to focus upon 
            the important issues of health care in Argyll and Clyde.</P>

            the south, including the problem of parking by city centre commuters 
            in residential streets in southern Edinburgh; further notes with concern 
            the proposal for an out-of-town football stadium at Straiton that 
            can only exacerbate existing traffic problems; considers that improved 
            transport infrastructure, such as the proposed park-and-ride site 
            at Burdiehouse, is essential to help tackle the problem, and considers 
            that the City of Edinburgh and Midlothian councils and the Scottish 
            Executive should ensure that these transport problems in southern 
            Edinburgh can be resolved with added benefit to the wider Lothian 
            and Borders region.</P>

            industry to safely and efficiently transport abnormal loads on Scotland's 
            road network; notes the present difficulties being experienced by 
            the industry in relation to the operation of police escorts for HGVs 
            carrying abnormal loads; believes that the use of private escorting 
            services which operate in parts of England would improve the efficiency 
            of the haulage industry and reduce the burden on our police force, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should facilitate this in
