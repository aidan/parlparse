<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5603</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>National Tartan Register - Located in Hawick</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the growing backing for a proposed national tartan register for Scotland and urges ministers to give close consideration to such a register being housed in the National Genealogy Centre, currently under construction in the Scottish Borders&rsquo; town of Hawick, as an appropriate location; notes that placing the register in Hawick would represent a major boost for the area, and believes that the additional jobs created by locating the register in Hawick would be of significant benefit to an economy hit by a spate of redundancies in textiles and electronics.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5602</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>National Post Office Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes National Post Office Week from 19 to 23 February 2007 which aims to highlight and campaign against Westminster government plans to close approximately 2,500 post offices across the United Kingdom, several hundred of which will be in Scotland; congratulates the coalition of groups behind the campaign including Age Concern, Citizens Advice, the Communication Workers Union, the Countryside Alliance, Local Works, the National Federation of SubPostmasters, the National Pensioners Convention, Royal National Institute of the Blind and the Townswomen&rsquo;s Guilds; strongly believes that an accessible post office network in urban, suburban and rural areas is vital to the future of vibrant communities and sustainable local economies; notes research by the New Economics Foundation that each urban post office saves small businesses around &pound;270,000 every year; encourages all interested parties to respond to the current DTI post office network consultation that runs until 8 March 2007, and also calls on the Scottish Executive to do everything in its power to oppose the proposed cuts in the Scottish post office network.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5601&diams; </strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Future For Our Post Offices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the statement by the Future for Our Post Office campaign, a diverse range of stakeholder groups including the Communication Workers Union, the National Federation of SubPostmasters, Age Concern and the National Pensioners&rsquo; Convention; is concerned about the impact that current UK Government proposals will have on post office services to the public across Scotland, both in towns such as Grangemouth and Bo&rsquo;ness and in smaller communities such as Brightons, especially for vulnerable groups in rural and urban deprived areas; notes that the role of the Scottish Parliament and the regional assemblies is part of the consultation being undertaken; believes that there should be a greater role and remit for the Scottish Executive and Scottish Parliament in respect of Post Office Ltd and more devolved and local accountability regarding post office provision, and believes that the Executive should make a submission in support of this to the current DTI consultation, calling also for the UK Government to (a) provide additional funding for the entire post office network, (b) enhance the products and services on offer to customers, (c) ensure that the post office is the shop front for national and Scottish government services, (d) extend the Social Network Payment to include additional funding for the urban deprived network and crown post offices, (e) establish a more functional replacement product for the post office card account that tackles financial exclusion, to be run and operated through Post Office Ltd, (f) improve and strengthen proposed access criteria so that these genuinely meet the needs of local communities in Scotland, (g) prevent further avoidable closures of rural and highland post offices and (h) ensure that a significant national network of crown post offices has a central role in Post Office Ltd&rsquo;s future strategy.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5600</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Government&rsquo;s Decision to Pursue a Programme of New Nuclear Power Stations - &quot;Unlawful&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the High Court judgement that the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to pursue a programme of new nuclear power stations is unlawful; congratulates Greenpeace on bringing the case in an effort to ensure full and free public information; agrees with Mr Justice Sullivan&rsquo;s judgement that the government&rsquo;s energy review did not constitute the &quot;fullest public consultation&quot; that had been promised as a condition for backing new nuclear power stations in the 2003 Energy White Paper, that the consultation exercise on the energy review was &quot;seriously flawed&quot; and that the process was &quot;manifestly inadequate and unfair&quot; because no clear proposals nor adequate information was made available by the government to allow consultees to make an &quot;intelligent response&quot;; deplores the fact that the government&rsquo;s failure to disclose relevant documents made it impossible for stakeholders to comment on important aspects of the policy; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s energy needs can be met by developing renewable energy rather than nuclear power, and resolves that there shall be no nuclear power stations in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5599</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Success for the University of Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre at the University of Edinburgh for its success in having been selected to house, manage and direct the latest &pound;113 million national high performance computing facility for UK computational science, HECToR (High End Computing Terascale Resource), which will provide UK researchers with a world-class capability to undertake increasingly complex studies across a range of scientific disciplines.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5592</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Unicef Report on Child Poverty Shames UK</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is ashamed to find that, according to UNICEF&rsquo;s <em>Report Card 7, Child Poverty in Perspective: An Overview of Child Well-being in Rich Countries,</em>the United Kingdom has come last in a comparative examination of children&rsquo;s well-being in 21 countries; believes that this report on child poverty, deprivation, quality of life, safety, health and behaviour is a terrible indictment of the failure of government policy in Britain; notes that, while other countries have made real progress on many fronts, the British government has fared particularly badly; notes that the countries of Scandinavia have fared far better and generally occupy the top places in the study because of their policies to redistribute wealth and the higher political priority given by their governments to children&rsquo;s needs, and concludes that, if Britain is to be rid of this particular badge of shame, then improving children&rsquo;s well-being in Britain must now become an urgent priority.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5591</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Scottish NHS Treatment and Care of Former Servicemen and Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is of the view that the very best NHS treatment must be given to the young Scottish men and women who have been discharged from the British armed services as a result of the physical and mental wounds that they have suffered in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere; notes that the absence of military hospitals anywhere in the United Kingdom places additional burdens on these courageous young ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen and also those involved in their treatment, care and rehabilitation; is confident that the NHS personnel are more than equal to this challenge; wishes to remind the nation that our servicemen and servicewomen are rightly acknowledged as among the finest of the United Nations&rsquo; peacekeepers, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive, working in tandem with the Ministry of Defence, to ensure that sufficient means are given to those concerned with the NHS treatment and care of these young military veterans so that they can return to their communities as soon as possible and in the knowledge that the NHS has shown to them the compassionate care they so eminently deserve.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5583</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Disband the SBCCU</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the establishment of the Special Branch Community Contact Unit (SBCCU) by Tayside Police in that its actions appear focussed on monitoring anti-war, Palestinian rights and Muslim groups within Dundee&rsquo;s further education institutions; also notes that members of the SBCCU attended the University of Dundee Freshers&rsquo; Fair, did not identify themselves as police officers and proceeded to question students staffing the Stop the War stall about their plans for future activities and views on the situation in the Middle East; further notes with concern the SBCCU&rsquo;s practice of sitting in on meetings of the Islamic Society within the University of Dundee; expresses concern that information collected by Tayside SBCCU may also be passed overseas, including to countries with poor human rights records, a particular concern as a university like Dundee attracts a large number of overseas students; believes that such actions put Muslim groups under suspicion and are extremely unhelpful in the current Islamophobic climate and that such action by the police engenders fear in students, discourages them from participating in political activities, stifles debate and undermines the very principle of academic freedom within universities and colleges; further believes that it should not be the role of Special Branch officers to monitor the political activities of student groups on university and college campuses; congratulates the representatives of the University and College Union who have joined students in publicly voicing their concerns about the unit in Dundee; calls on Tayside Police to radically rethink its strategy for community bridge-building and the role of Special Branch in it, and calls for the disbandment of the SBCCU.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5582</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Location of Creative Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, while supporting the general principle of dispersal of Scottish Executive departments and agencies throughout Scotland, nevertheless believes that Creative Scotland must remain in Scotland&rsquo;s capital city, which plays host to the world&rsquo;s biggest international festival of the arts; notes that meetings and conferences concerning the arts are held every week of the year and that moving Creative Scotland out of Edinburgh may jeopardise this and the contribution made to Scotland&rsquo;s income from tourism and culture during the period of the Edinburgh Festival, and urges the Executive to support the City of Edinburgh Council in its plans to locate Creative Scotland in a new and completely sympathetic environment in one of the developments that will further advance the attractiveness of Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5578</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Recognition for Kashmiri Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and applauds the struggle of public sector workers in Pakistan-administered Kashmir to force the government to implement promises of compensation for losses suffered during the earthquake; notes that since 6 February 2007 these workers, organised under the Employees Action Committee, have been involved in an indefinite strike; further notes that women workers from the social welfare and education sectors have also joined the strike; condemns the government&rsquo;s decision of 7 February to declare the strike illegal and to issue a &quot;Section 144&quot; on the capital city, Muzaffarabad, which makes any meeting of more than four workers in the street illegal; acknowledges that leading activists in the strike, who are also members of the Trade Union Rights Campaign &ndash; Kashmir, could face severe government repression as a result of their role in the strike; notes that at the time of the October 2005 earthquake the government praised these public sector workers as &quot;heroes&quot; because they saved the lives of thousands and eased the suffering of many more, despite the losses they themselves incurred, and that as a result the federal Pakistan and the Kashmir governments offered to wipe out bank loans taken by workers during that time and also give them a bonus equivalent to three months pay; understands that none of these promises have been implemented and that compensation for damage and destruction of houses has not yet been paid, and is concerned that millions of rupees of earthquake relief funds have disappeared into the pockets of corrupt government officials and army officers who are associated with the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5573</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Power Meter Madness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the increasing intransigence of Scottish Power, which has thus far refused to end the back charging of token prepayment meter customers despite condemnation by politicians from all parties; expresses concern that the regulator, Ofgem, has taken insufficient action to stop Scottish Power continuing with a practice that pushes its low income consumers into debt through no fault of their own, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry asking him to intervene with Ofgem to ensure that this practice is ended immediately.</p>
