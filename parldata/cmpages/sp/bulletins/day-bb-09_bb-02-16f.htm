<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3455</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Titian&rsquo;s Diana and Actaeon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the continuing availability of Titian&rsquo;s Diana and Actaeon for viewing in Scotland into the future; regrets the manner in which this issue arose and the threat to a Scottish future for this painting brought about by the approach of the Duke of Sutherland; calls on the Duke of Sutherland to remove any similar threat now or into the future to any other painting currently housed in Scotland by donating those paintings to the national galleries of London and Scotland; further urges the Duke of Sutherland to donate the &pound;50 million received for Titian&rsquo;s Diana and Actaeon to the people of Sutherland, the Highlands and Scotland more widely as one small step toward redeeming a tarnished reputation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3454</strong> <strong>Angela Constance:</strong> <strong>World Community Arts Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the World Community Arts Day 2009, which aims to encourage people worldwide to create and showcase various forms of art, such as song, dance, theatre, drawing, painting, writing, poetry, photography, lectures, tours, talk, art classes and many other forms of expression, to promote a theme of caring and sharing; commends the celebration that will take place on 17 February 2009 in Livingston; considers art an important catalyst for bringing communities and the world together, and encourages everyone to attend their local Community Arts Day celebrations and to enjoy the diverse range of creativity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3453</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Families Outside&rsquo;s Support to Children of Prisoners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of Families Outside to support and provide information for the estimated 16,500 children in Scotland who are affected by a parent&rsquo;s imprisonment; recognises the devastating effect that a parent&rsquo;s imprisonment can have on children and the need to ensure adequate support and information is provided, and welcomes the publication of Families Outside&rsquo;s booklets, <em>Honest? Emma&rsquo;s story</em> and <em>What&rsquo;s the story? Jenny&rsquo;s Journey</em>, which are tailored to specific age groups in a way that gives children a greater understanding of what is happening when a family member is sent to prison.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3452</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the City of Edinburgh Council on its Progressive 2009-10 Budget</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the City of Edinburgh Council on its latest budget; notes that the 2009-10 budget will provide an additional &pound;1.2 million for older people&rsquo;s care, &pound;2 million to support adults and children with physical or learning disabilities and &pound;1.4 million for the care of vulnerable children; further notes that &pound;1 million will be provided to reduce energy consumption and the council&rsquo;s carbon footprint as well as &pound;130,000 to promote and support cycling as a sustainable method of transport; further notes that &pound;1.3 million will be provided for economic development, including &pound;500,000 for securing business investment and &pound;50,000 to help bring 3000 people into sustainable employment; further notes that the budget will provide &pound;6 million towards replacing Portobello High School, &pound;1.5 million for the initial design phase for James Gillespie&rsquo;s High School and &pound;4.1 million towards the refurbishment of Towerbank and Corstorphine primary schools, and considers this budget to be a green, sustainable and well considered response to the current financial difficulties facing Scotland and Edinburgh, as well as an excellent financial framework to support Edinburgh moving forward.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3398</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Council Safeguarding School Budgets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement from the City of Edinburgh Council that money for schools will be protected in its forthcoming budget and, recognising that budget decisions are always tough and all options, including education cuts, had to be considered, understands the hard work that must have gone into making this happen, including discussions with local parents and schools, and appreciates the continuing high priority that the council has placed on properly funded education.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mike Pringle</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3398.1</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Council Safeguarding School Budgets</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3398) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that the City of Edinburgh Council failed to safeguard schools by rejecting Labour proposals to reverse last year&rsquo;s 1.5% cut and invest an extra &pound;2.7 million in frontline school services; considers that schools across the city will remain under acute pressure due to the under funding of schools from last year, and further considers that the Scottish Government has failed to support the development of new and refurbished schools to enable buildings past their sell by date to be replaced or substantially refurbished in an acceptable timescale.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3351.2</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive Opt-out</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3351) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from &quot;with regret&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the vote by the European Parliament on 17 December 2008 in favour of removing Britain&rsquo;s working time directive opt-out was supported by Scotland&rsquo;s Liberal Democrat MEP; also notes that the decision of the European Parliament represents a difference of view from that of the Council of Ministers and will now be sent for negotiation and conciliation before there is any question of its final approval or implementation; further notes that a failure to agree between the European Parliament and Council of Ministers will result in the proposal falling; notes the role played by Scotland&rsquo;s retained firefighters and the vital service that these firefighters provide to their communities; considers that in any future potential change to the working time directive an appropriate provision to allow a continuation of fire services in the Highlands and Islands in particular will be required, and expresses confidence in those involved to ensure such an outcome.&quot;</p>
