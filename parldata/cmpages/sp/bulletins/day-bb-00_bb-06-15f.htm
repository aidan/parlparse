    Scottish Rugby Magazine &quot;Team of the Year&quot; award and no less than four Scottish

    &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;continues to support the Executive&#146;s
    policies on law and order and commends the priorities identified in the <i>Programme for
    Government</i> being taken forward by the Executive, including combating drug misuse as
    set out in the Drugs Action Plan <i>Protecting our Future</i> and through the creation of
    the Scottish Drugs Enforcement Agency which will fund an additional 100 officers in local
    forces, tackling youth crime, particularly persistent offenders, as set out in the report <i>It&#146;s
    a Criminal Waste: Stop Youth Crime Now</i> and the Executive&#146;s response, helping
    witnesses by extending a volunteer Witness Service to all Sheriff Courts, and the
    injection of an additional £8.9 million for the police which is sufficient for forces to
    recruit a further 300 extra officers&quot;.<i><strong> </strong></i></p>

    &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that issues of crime and punishment
    are complex; contends that to ensure public confidence a criminal justice system requires
    to be effective, which in turn depends on adequate resourcing at every level; further
    recognises that there is some identifiable concern amongst the public about both current
    sentencing patterns and the effectiveness of detention; welcomes the fact that Scotland
    has human rights responsibilities as a result of the incorporation of the European
    Convention on Human Rights, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to consider the
    establishment of an accurate review of public attitudes to sentencing and detention which
    would inform both the judiciary and the Scottish Prison Service and further to address
    urgently the current under-resourcing of all parts of the criminal justice system in
    Scotland&quot;. </p>
