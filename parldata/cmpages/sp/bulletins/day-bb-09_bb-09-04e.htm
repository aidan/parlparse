<p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information to the Parliament.</strong></p>

<p><strong>S3W-26899</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether any costs incurred by requiring East Renfrewshire Council to monitor the movements of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi in Libya will be funded directly by the Scottish Government or whether these costs will be met by council tax payers in East Renfrewshire.</p>

<p><strong>S3W-26903</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive for what reasons opportunities resulting from the replacement Forth bridge to maximise public transport provision such as park-and-ride are to be developed in parallel with the scheme rather than being legislated for in the proposed Forth Replacement Crossing Bill.</p>
