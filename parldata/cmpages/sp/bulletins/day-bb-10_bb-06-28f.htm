<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6663</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Scottish Hockey and Scotland&rsquo;s Islands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the assurances given by Scottish Hockey that it will not impose a rule on its national league matches requiring them to be played on the Scottish mainland unless both teams agree otherwise; also notes their undertaking to review a similar rule that already applies to its District Cup and Plate competition; welcomes this as a recognition that island teams should not be discriminated against, and believes that Scottish mainland teams lucky enough to travel to Orkney or any other islands for a match will receive a warm island welcome, which will make the effort of getting there well worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6662</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Ship-to-Ship Transfer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010 laid before the UK Parliament in April 2010; warmly welcomes the completion of a regulatory framework for transfers building on measures taken by the Scottish Parliament in response to proposals for cargo transfers in the Firth of Forth that were supported by all parties; supports the principle that transfer operations should be permitted only in harbours that have been licensed by ministers as safe; believes that the new regulations are necessary in order to meet the requirements of international environmental law; is concerned at lobbying by the shipping industry to annul these regulations, and urges UK ministers to ignore these efforts in favour of defending our coastal environment and communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6661</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Caledonia Clubhouse, Falkirk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Caledonia Clubhouse, based in Falkirk, for achieving the Silver Standard at the Gardening Scotland Show; acknowledges the work of Forth Valley College in assisting the clubhouse in creating the Celtic motif pallet as its emblem, and wishes Caledonia Clubhouse well when it hosts its annual T in the Garden event during the summer.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6660</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Closure of Applications to the Independent Living Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the Independent Living Fund, which provides financial support for disabled people, is now closed to applications in 2010-11, leaving many disabled people housebound and isolated, and believes that the UK Government, through the Department for Work and Pensions, must look urgently at providing emergency funding to address this distressing situation.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6659</strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Bigotry still Blighting Scottish Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the sectarian vandalism suffered by the Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Bridgeton in Glasgow; considers that such incidents are still an all too frequent occurrence in 21st century Scotland; notes that this incident occurred just shortly after the church hosted a mass to celebrate its centenary, having opened on the Feast of the Sacred Heart in 1910; recognises the contribution that Scotland&rsquo;s Catholic community makes to Scottish society and regrets any sectarian abuse that it suffers; notes the large amount of effort that the parishioners and the parish priest put into redecorating the church in time for the centenary celebrations; regrets that the vandalism has now tarnished this impressive community effort; hopes that the perpetrators are identified in the near future, and wishes the church well with the rest of its centenary year.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6652</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Construction Courses in Colleges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by North Highland College to stop its roof slating and tiling course at its Alness campus despite sufficient demand for the course; acknowledges that, if the proposals are implemented, there will be no such course provision north of Arbroath; recognises that Arbroath College takes on only 14 apprentices for roof slating and tiling per year and, other than this small provision, those wishing to enrol on these courses must travel to the central belt for college training; considers that North Highland College will not receive any additional funding for running the course as it can reach its capped funding without it and that in the current economic climate if the course is stopped it will be very unlikely that it will be reinstated in the near future; is concerned that this could be the start of construction courses being terminated as colleges try to make savings, and believes that, if the Scottish Government is committed to linking procurement to training, it must secure adequate construction training facilities throughout Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-6648</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>BBC Spending</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns flamboyant spending by the BBC on its coverage of major sporting and cultural events; believes that, in times of such economic hardship and austerity, the BBC should not be wasting licence fee payers&rsquo; money on new studios, flights and excessive staff numbers; notes with incredulity what is considered the lavish expenditure by the BBC to cover the World Cup, spending &pound;1 million on a studio overlooking Table Mountain while also sending 295 staff<strong>, </strong>twice as many as ITV sent despite covering the same number of games; is also shocked that the BBC intends to send 400 staff to cover this year&rsquo;s Glastonbury festival at a cost of almost &pound;2 million, despite viewing figures averaging only 800,000 last year; further believes that such money would be better spent on quality programming in Scotland where licence fee payers are routinely short-changed as Scottish licence fee payers contribute over &pound;300 million to the BBC expenditure while Ofcom calculates that only &pound;31.6 million is spent on Scottish network productions; considers that the BBC promise to implement the recommendations of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission and increase expenditure in Scotland to approximately &pound;70 million is little more than a token gesture considering the vast amount of money that Scottish licence fee payers fork out annually; is aware that &pound;18 million was paid to Jonathan Ross for a three year contract, that 46 executives earn more than the Prime Minister&rsquo;s &pound;194,250 salary, and agrees that the BBC must spend licence fee payers money in a more prudent, creative and sensible way and end its culture of extravagance.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6647</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Luss Visitor Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the decision by the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority to reject a community proposal to run the visitor centre in Luss; understands that Luss Community Council together with Luss Community Development Trust would have reopened and maintained the centre, creating training and employment opportunities; deeply regrets that the national park authority closed down the debate on the future of the centre at its meeting on 23 June 2010, at which it is believed that the community proposal was not fully discussed, by awarding preferred bidder status to a commercial operator from outwith the area, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene and reverse this decision, which will see a public asset, paid for by the taxpayer, benefiting a commercial operator instead of the community of Luss.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-6638</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Illegal Killing of Birds of Prey</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that birds of prey are important indicators of the health of the environment and that, despite best efforts, many of Scotland&rsquo;s native species of bird of prey have an unfavourable conservation status, often due to illegal killing; considers that the prevalence of this criminality is most obvious in upland areas, particularly in some areas managed for driven grouse shooting in the southern uplands and central and eastern Highlands; welcomes the steps taken by PAWS and recent environment ministers to address the problem of illegal killing of birds of prey; welcomes recent statements by landowning bodies condemning illegal poisoning but hopes that this will be translated into positive action on the ground and demonstrable improvements in the range and breeding success of key bird of prey species; expresses concern at any prospect of licensed control of birds of prey to protect reared pheasants or other gamebirds; applauds the work of the Langholm Moor Demonstration Project as a constructive approach; understands that any move toward licensed control of birds of prey would make Scotland the only country in Europe to routinely sanction such action, sending out mixed messages to land managers about the obligation to conserve some of our most threatened species, and expresses concern that this would have implications for Scotland&rsquo;s international reputation and for important sectors, such as tourism.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-6626</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Taxation on Lifeline Air Routes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the effects that proposals to replace air passenger duty (APD) with a per plane tax will have on remote and rural communities in Scotland; notes that, under current tax rules, passengers departing from Highlands and Islands airports and those flying on any service operated by aircraft with less than 20 seats or 10 tonnes maximum take-off weight are exempt from APD; believes that any proposed change is likely to force airlines to reduce the number of flights that they operate as their planes will need to be full in order to make them profitable; considers that the Highlands and Islands are dependent on lifeline air routes and will be directly affected by any change in air tax; further believes that the added tax will result in increased costs, a reduction in services and a greater unreliability, and notes that the <span lang="">Chief Secretary to the Treasury, </span>Danny Alexander MP, commenting in 2007 on previous plans to introduce per plane tax, stated that it would be &quot;&hellip;a serious blow to the Highland economy&hellip;&quot; and &quot;&hellip;a reversal of the Government&rsquo;s recognition&quot; that the services are a lifeline to the Highlands and Islands&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-6591.1#</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Independent Living in Scotland Magazine, Rights Here Rights Now</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6591) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end &quot;, but considers with regret that the previous UK administration led by Labour set back the interests of the independent living movement by its proposed changes to the Independent Living Fund (ILF) criteria that would restrict new applications to those disabled people who are in paid employment of 16 hours or more and that this could massively reduce the number of new people eligible for the ILF, which assists disabled people to access essential support.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6377#</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Perspectives of Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report, <em>Perspectives of Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison</em>, issued by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland and Families Outside and which explores the experiences of children and young people who have had a family member sent to prison; welcomes the consideration that has already been given to this important issue during the proceedings of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill; notes with concern the finding of the report that each year as many as 16,500 children across Scotland, including the South of Scotland region, will experience the imprisonment of a parent or carer, and believes that a cross-party approach is the best way to ensure that the rights of the children of offenders, who are often the innocent and forgotten victims of crime, are respected in the legal system.</p>
