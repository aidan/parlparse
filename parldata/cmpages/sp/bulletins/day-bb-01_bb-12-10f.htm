          <p><strong>*S1M-2534#</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Save Post 
            Office Jobs</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">views 
            with grave concern the cutbacks in postal services in Scotland being 
            proposed by Consignia, including the closure in Glasgow of Scotland's 
            only Parcel Distribution Office and only remaining International Mail 
            Centre and a potential one in ten job losses in other areas, threatening 
            business and domestic services, with transfer of work to newly built 
            centres in Coventry and Berkshire; opposes any plan to sell off Post 
            Office Vehicle Services which could result in further savage job cuts; 
            upholds strongly the Post Office and Royal Mail as respected national 
            institutions; deplores the rundown of a trusted service which commands 
            public respect and affection thanks to the exceptional dedication 
            of its workforce, and urges all who benefit from the dedication of 
            postal workers, especially at this time of year, to realise their 
            present plight and support their campaign to retain decent standards 
            of service and maintain a public service.</a></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2533#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Musical Instrument 
            Instructors</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern reports 
            of impending changes in the contracts, status and conditions of musical 
            instrument instructors in schools, designed to make them casual, lower 
            grade employees; believes that giving pupils the chance to learn to 
            play a musical instrument and to take part in orchestras and groups 
            is an essential part of educational and cultural life, and considers 
            that the Executive should ensure that musical instrument instructors 
            retain the contracts and status of full teaching members of the school 
            community.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Farquhar Munro<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2532</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Land Reform (Scotland) 
            Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>-That the Parliament, for the purposes 
            of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Land Reform 
            (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure payable out 
            of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</p>

            (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) 
            (No.14) (Scotland) Order 2001</strong>-That the Health and Community 
            Care Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) 
            (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.14) (Scotland) Order 
            2001 (SSI 2001/451) be approved.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2530</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon: Railtrack and the 
            Larkhall Project</strong>-That the Parliament notes with dismay the 
            decision by Railtrack plc not to support the Scottish Executive funded 
            rail link between Larkhall and Milngavie; recognises that this decision 
            has the potential to have a particular impact on Larkhall and the 
            surrounding communities as it jeopardises the future of a joint project 
            between the Scottish Executive and Strathclyde Passenger Transport; 
            re-iterates its view that this project would have brought substantial 
            economic and social benefits to Clydesdale, and urges Railtrack plc 
            to reconsider urgently their decision in order to ensure that this 
            project proceeds as planned to enable the economic and social regeneration 
            of the Larkhall area.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2529#</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon: New Lanark</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the significant contribution that New Lanark 
            has made to the social, cultural and educational fabric of Scotland; 
            congratulates the New Lanark Conservation Trust on the excellent work 
            that it has done in restoring the village to its natural beauty, and 
            calls on UNESCO to grant the village full World Heritage Status.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2528#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Young Runaways</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the report <i>Missing Out - Young Runaways 
            in Scotland</i>; commends the University of York, Aberlour Child Care 
            Trust, Extern, Children's Promise and The Children's Society for producing 
            this report, the most extensive piece of research yet undertaken into 
            young people under 16 who run away or are forced to leave home; notes 
            that this is the first comprehensive research to provide both an overall 
            picture of the scale and extent of the problem while suggesting workable 
            strategies for responding to the needs of this very vulnerable group 
            of young people, and asks the Executive to look closely at the findings 
            and recommendations of the report and act accordingly. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2527</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Sentencing for 
            Breach of the Peace at Faslane Blockade</strong>-That the Parliament 
            condemns the disgraceful three month prison sentence handed down to 
            Jenny Gaiawyn on 29 November 2001 by Sheriff Morag Galbraith for a 
            breach of the peace at the blockade in February 2001 of the Faslane 
            nuclear base; considers this sentence to be an outrageous attack on 
            this young woman's human right to protest peacefully, which is a fundamental 
            human right enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and 
            as such should be upheld in law; further considers the sentence to 
            be a scandalous reflection of the arbitrariness of the Scottish legal 
            system, and calls on the Minister for Justice to set up an inquiry 
            into the inconsistencies of sentencing in the courts, which have seen 
            people acquitted, fined or even sentenced to a prison term for the 
            same &quot;crime&quot; of breach of the peace.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2526</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Breastfeeding 
            Clinic at Yorkhill, Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Queen Mother's Hospital at Yorkhill NHS Trust in establishing 
            Scotland's first breastfeeding clinic where breastfeeding mothers 
            can attend every Monday between 8.00 am and 6.00 pm without an appointment; 
            notes that this is the first open clinic of its kind in Scotland, 
            and supports the encouragement which the clinic will offer to mothers 
            to continue breastfeeding beyond the initial two weeks in order to 
            benefit both their health and that of the baby.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2525#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil: Railtrack and 
            the Gourock Project</strong>-That the Parliament notes with dismay 
            the decision by Railtrack plc not to support four Scottish Executive 
            funded enhancement projects, including the project at Gourock train 
            station; recognises that this decision has a particular impact on 
            the Gourock project as it jeopardises the future of the joint capital 
            project between Railtrack, the Scottish Executive, Inverclyde Council 
            and private companies to redevelop the Gourock waterfront; further 
            notes that this project, which would include an integrated transport 
            hub, offers substantial benefits to the Inverclyde economy, and asks 
            Railtrack, as a matter of urgency, to reconsider this short-sighted 
            decision before the project is lost and the people of Inverclyde are 
            robbed of a major economic opportunity. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2524</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Scottish Local Government 
            (Elections) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the Scottish 
            Local Government (Elections) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2519#</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson: Scottish Number 
            Plates</strong>-That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should recognise the importance of national symbols and the absolute 
            right of people to identify with their country of choice and should 
            detail what action it has undertaken thus far with the Driver and 
            Vehicle Licensing Agency and Department for Transport, Local Government 
            and the Regions to protect the rights of Scotland's people with vehicles 
            registered here to display a Saltire and/or &quot;SCO&quot; on their 
            vehicle number plates, and affirms that from this date the Scottish 
            Executive should not accept or endorse any situation whereby these 
            rights might be eroded.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2516</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: National Asthma 
            Campaign Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates National 
            Asthma Campaign Scotland on its work over the past year in drawing 
            public and parliamentary attention to the long-term condition of asthma 
            which affects over 400,000 people in Scotland; welcomes the National 
            Asthma Campaign's Asthma Audit 2001 and its survey of asthma services 
            in Scotland of winter 2000 which together, for the first time, give 
            a true indication of the work that still needs to be done to tackle 
            the condition, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with the 
            National Asthma Campaign Scotland in its mission to conquer asthma.

          <p> <strong>S1M-2515</strong> <strong>John Scott: Beatson Oncology Centre, 
            Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament notes with extreme concern and 
            regret the decision by four senior consultants to leave the Beatson 
            Oncology Centre in Glasgow as a result of major difficulties in the 
            provision of cancer care services and low morale; notes that this 
            leaves the Beatson Oncology Centre with 10 vacant posts which seriously 
            impedes its ability to deliver cancer care and treatment, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to take decisive action to address the situation.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2514</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Tartan Army Award</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the Tartan Army on winning the Belgian 
            Olympic Committee's Fair Play Prize 2001 for the excellent behaviour 
            displayed by Scotland fans in Brussels when visiting for the Belgium 
            v Scotland world cup qualifier in September; notes that this award 
            is the latest in a string of accolades bestowed on Scottish football 
            fans; further notes that a record 15,000 Scotland supporters travelled 
            to the match; commends those supporters for the good name they give 
            Scotland throughout the world, and looks forward to the presentation 
            of the award to representatives of the Scotland Travel Club and the 
            SFA in Brussels on 7 December 2001.</p>

            congratulates all those involved in the Inverness Highland bid 2008 
            for the title of European Capital of Culture; notes that the Inverness 
            Highland 2008 bid is the only Scottish one, and recognises that a 
            successful bid would bring important social, economic and cultural 
            rewards for Scotland in general and for Inverness and the Highlands 
            in particular.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2512</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Breaking the Organised 
            Child Sex Rings</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that well 
            organised and financed people are systematically abusing children 
            in the sex trade using games, alcohol and drugs to groom and coerce 
            children into sex rings who are then exploited, degraded and abused 
            by paedophile adults for money and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to resource the police to allow them to set up a task force to combat 
            child abuse in the sex trade, tackle the provision of children for 
            sex and paying for sex with children by adults and target crimes against 
            children on the internet in order to ensure a course of action is 
            followed that will break organised child sex rings and bring the perpetrators 
            of child sex abuse to justice. </p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2511</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Head of Communications

            North Ayrshire Council on appointing Mr Gerry O' Brien as its new 
            Head of Communications; notes Mr O' Brien's previous posts with the 
            Conservative Party and the Conservative Group in the Scottish Parliament; 
            expects that Mr O' Brien will have few ideological problems in helping 
            to implement new Labour policies in North Ayrshire as they are mostly 
            identical to failed Tory policies, and hopes that Mr O' Brien's efforts 
            are rewarded with the same success as the Tories in recent years, 
            who have all but disappeared from the electoral map in most of Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2510#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Annual St Andrew's 
            Day Cultural Celebration</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Children in Scotland (<i>Clann an Alba</i>) on the success of its 
            Equal Futures event held on 30 November 2001 in Glasgow; notes that 
            this was attended by schoolchildren from all over Scotland with a 
            view to building racial equality and believes that St Andrew's Day 
            should be designated as an annual day of celebration of Scotland's 
            cultural diversity, with consideration given to public holiday status 
            so that everyone in Scotland can participate. </p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2509</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Ministerial Responsibility 
            for Education and Schools</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            the principal day-to-day responsibility for education and schools 
            now lies with the Deputy Minister for Education and Young People and 
            not with the Minister for Education and Young People; regrets that 
            this change in responsibilities was not announced to the Parliament 
            before the vote on the appointment of Ministers, which is contrary 
            to the principles of openness and accountability on which the Parliament 
            was founded; expresses concern that there will now be no Minister 
            in the Cabinet who has hands-on responsibility for the major devolved 
            area of responsibility that covers schools and the investment that 
            education of young people makes in our society, and calls on the First 
            Minister to bring this issue to the Parliament for full debate.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2508</strong> <strong>Fiona McLeod: GM Cross Contamination</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the Mexican Government's ban on all genetically 
            modified material; is distressed that cross-contamination from GM 
            crops banned eight years ago is having a direct effect on current 
            crops; believes that the only answer is a moratorium on GM field trials, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to reverse its decision to carry 
            out field trials at Munlochy and other sites in Scotland.</p>

            Matheson, Mr Lloyd Quinan, Mr Adam Ingram, Mr Gil Paterson, Michael

          <p><strong>S1M-2507</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: School Education 
            (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that 
            the School Education (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Nicol Stephen</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2506</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Land Reform (Scotland) 
            Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees to the general principles 
            of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2505</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Aggregates Tax: Lack 
            of Scottish Exemptions</strong>-That the Parliament notes that special 
            exemptions from the aggregates tax are to be granted to Northern Ireland 
            following HM Treasury's pre-budget report; believes that the imposition 
            of the tax on Scotland from 1 April 2002 will be damaging to the Scottish 
            economy, especially in rural areas and will not result in any environmental 
            gain but will lead to the closure of some smaller quarries, will place 
            a greater burden of traffic on our roads and will place a particular 
            burden upon local authorities which could lead to higher council taxes 
            and/or cuts in building and roads repairs programmes; further believes 
            that the failure of the Scottish Executive to accept in any way the 
            widespread concerns on the impact of the aggregates tax and its total 
            refusal to stand up to Her Majesty's Government on this issue contrasts 
            poorly with the united approach pursued by politicians in the Northern 
            Ireland Assembly and that, had the coalition parties campaigned against 
            this tax instead of refusing to voice any word of criticism, Scotland 
            too may have received valuable exemptions, and therefore calls upon 
            the Scottish Executive to state exactly what, if anything, it plans 
            to do in relation to the imposition of this tax on Scotland and to 
            estimate what the cost to the economy will be from it. </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2504#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Minister for 
            Highlands and Islands</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that 
            the Highlands and Islands have unique needs; notes that the case for 
            the needs of the Highlands and Islands areas needs to be made at the 
            highest levels of government; regrets the decision of the First Minister 
            to drop the role of 'Minister for the Highlands and Islands' from 
            the Scottish Executive and calls upon the First Minister to reinstate 
            this role.</p>
