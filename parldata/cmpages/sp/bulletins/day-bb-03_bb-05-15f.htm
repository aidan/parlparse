          <p><strong>*S2M-32</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson: Recognition of 
            the Role of Nursery Nurses</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the important and expanding role of nursery nurses in the pre-five 
            sector; further recognises the demands placed on nursery nurses in 
            ensuring continual professional development to meet registration requirements, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive to work with COSLA to reach 
            agreement with UNISON on behalf of nursery nurses.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-31#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow and Edinburgh 
            Airports Investment</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the response 
            by BAA plc to Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s consultation document, 
            <em>The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: 
            A National Consultation &#150; Scotland,</em> which states that the 
            upgrading of Glasgow Airport to international hub status would cost 
            £1.1 billion, £200 million less than government estimates, and that 
            the cost of upgrading Edinburgh Airport would be £1.3 billion, £400 
            million more than previous estimates; further notes the massive investment 
            planned for airport expansion in the south east of England; expresses 
            its support for Scottish Airports Ltd&#146;s call on Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government not to put Scotland&#146;s long-term economical prospects 
            at risk by opting to develop only one of the country&#146;s main airports, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations 
            to Her Majesty&#146;s Government to ensure that the necessary investment 
            is made available to ensure that both airports grow to their full 
            potential.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-30</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Broomhill Day Centre, 
            Penicuik</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the excellent and 
            consistent standard of care provided by the Broomhill Day Centre in 
            Penicuik; commends the dedicated staff and volunteers for their work 
            over many years in establishing the centre as an example of high quality 
            day care facilities in Scotland; is concerned at the precarious nature 
            of its funding for 2003-04 which could jeopardise this standard of 
            care, and calls on all funding bodies to ensure that the centre&#146;s 
            funding is secure.</p>

            Executive to move the headquarters of Scottish Natural Heritage to 
            Inverness; looks forward to the further devolution of government departments 
            and agencies well away from the capital, to the benefit of Scotland 
            as a whole; recognises that the process of devolution away from Edinburgh 
            is very difficult for employees, and calls for all necessary support 
            to be made available to ease moves to other parts of the country, 
            now and in the future.</a></p>
