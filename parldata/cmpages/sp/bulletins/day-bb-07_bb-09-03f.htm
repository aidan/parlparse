          <p><strong>*S3M-403&diams; </strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>End Unequal Scottish Home Loss Payments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that as of 1 September 2007 the maximum home loss payment to those displaced from their homes in England by compulsory purchase increased to &pound;44,000, with the minimum amount paid increasing to &pound;4,400; notes that the equivalent maximum home loss payment in Scotland is &pound;15,000; views with concern that the last review of home loss payments in Scotland occurred in 1991; further notes that home loss payments in England have increased year-on-year since 2003; recognises that property values in Scotland have increased largely in line with those in England and Wales since 1991; regards with sympathy many people living in Cumbernauld who face compulsory purchase orders due to proposals such as the upgrade of the A80 and the demolition of the Ainslie/Maclehose scheme; believes that those facing compulsory purchase in Scotland deserve similar compensation to those in comparable situations elsewhere in the United Kingdom; strongly regrets the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s disregard of a review of home loss payments initiated by the previous administration, and considers that an urgent review of the matter is necessary to end this Scottish inequity.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-402</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Scotland 2011: Scottish Environment LINK&rsquo;s Challenge to the New Government</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Scotland 2011: Scottish Environment LINK&rsquo;s challenge to the new government </em>which sets out Scottish Environment LINK&rsquo;s vision for 2011 and the steps that government needs to take in order to realise that vision; recognises our dependence on our environment to guarantee Scotland&rsquo;s social and economic wellbeing, and, conscious of the dual threats that climate change and biodiversity loss pose to the wellbeing and quality of life of current and future generations of Scots, calls on the Scottish government to take urgent action to tackle these challenges, taking into account the action plan proposed in this document by Scottish Environment LINK.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-401</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Collapse of a Tenement Property in Maryhill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the collapse of a tenement property in the Maryhill constituency and offers its sympathy to those made homeless by this incident; further notes the need to find the cause of such catastrophic structural failure and calls on Glasgow City Council to work with the Health and Safety Executive to establish the cause, and congratulates the emergency services for their response and the staff of Community Central Hall for assisting, once again, those affected by an incident in the area.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-400</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Scottish Monument for Great War Soldiers in Flanders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its gratitude to the people of Flanders for erecting a Celtic cross to commemorate Scotland&rsquo;s fallen soldiers of the Great War; notes that the unveiling of the monument took place on 25 August 2007 on the Frezenberg Ridge in Zonnebeke which is where Scottish soldiers fought during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917;  thanks everyone who contributed towards the memorial and the commemorations, in particular Burgomaster Dirk Cardoen, First Alderman Franky Bryon and the Town Council of the municipality of Zonnebeke, and Erwin Ureel and all the staff of the Passchendale Memorial Museum 1917, and hopes that Scots will continue to remember yesterday&rsquo;s fallen and that many will journey to Flanders to the Scottish monument to learn about, and reflect on, the sacrifice that was made by our Scottish soldiers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-399</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Getting the Balance Right in Glasgow&rsquo;s West End</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vibrancy and diversity of Glasgow&rsquo;s West End as one of Scotland&rsquo;s most important cultural and conservation districts and the opportunity it presents to showcase the best of Glasgow&rsquo;s regeneration as a successful world city, but expresses concern at the proliferation of late licences in the area that are already affecting quality of life for residents; notes with concern the latest proposal from G1 Group for a night club as part of a development at Glasgow&rsquo;s Botanic Gardens which has attracted widescale opposition from local communities and which, if granted, would have a serious impact on local people, threatening the sustainability of the West End as a place to live, increasing noise and public disorder and putting further pressure on inadequate transport facilities, and calls on Glasgow City Council to review its licensing policy in relation to Glasgow&rsquo;s West End and reject any application for a late licence or night club at the Botanic Gardens.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-398</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Campaign Against Remploy Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the proposals by Remploy to close or transfer 43 factories out of a total of 83 that it operates; believes that there is a continuing need for sheltered factories to provide skilled and supportive employment as a choice suitable for many disabled people as well as supporting entry for others into mainstream employment; congratulates the workforce and the trade unions on the campaign being run by them against the closures; urges the Scottish Executive to take full advantage of European Union legislation allowing public procurement from organisations like Remploy, and calls on the UK Government to reconsider its support for the Modernising Remploy agenda and to establish an independent inquiry into the future employment needs of disabled people and the management and procurement arrangements at Remploy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-397</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Many Happy Returns to Crawforddyke Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its warm congratulations to Crawforddyke Primary School in Carluke which is celebrating its 50th birthday; hopes that students and staff both past and present enjoy the celebrations, and wishes the school all the very best in the future.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-396</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Playwrights&rsquo; Studio and Scottish Theatre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Playwrights&rsquo; Studio, Scotland on the exemplary work that it has done in developing and promoting Scottish playwrights and theatre at every level; also congratulates Scottish playwrights on the breadth and quality of their work; notes that these achievements are evident in the approximately 550 works by contemporary Scottish playwrights in the bookshop of Playwrights&rsquo; Studio, Scotland; notes the importance of theatre in encouraging healthy discourse in an era when mainstream media often fail to provide an adequate forum for debating serious issues; notes the international impact of recent Scottish theatre and the significant return on investment that it has yielded, both with respect to Scotland&rsquo;s international reputation and to direct benefits to the people of Scotland; notes that there is every indication that the secure long-term funding of Playwrights&rsquo; Studio, Scotland would have further considerable benefits for the nation, and trusts that these facts will be noted by the Scottish Arts Council/Creative Scotland when it comes to making funding decisions.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-392#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>International Recognition for Scottish Island Writers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish island writers who attended the ninth international book festival of island writers held on Ouessant island in Brittany from 22 to 26 August 2007; celebrates the 11 writers from Shetland, Fair Isle, Orkney, Lewis, Skye and Raasay whose work in Shetlandic, Gaelic and English provided the focus for this year&rsquo;s event; in particular welcomes the prize won by the poetry of Christine de Luca whose volume, Parallel Worlds, in Shetlandic dialect, has been translated into French; believes that works of excellence from our Scottish island authors should feature in future Scottish book festivals, and considers that appropriate support and encouragement should be given to nurture this internationally recognised talent and the translation of Scottish literature into other tongues.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-388</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Iraq: Banning of Oil Unions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with alarm the recent directive issued by the Iraqi oil minister, Hussein Shahrastani, banning oil companies in that country from dealing with trade unions and ordering them to exclude trade unionists from work committees; notes that, under a democratic system of government, workers have the inalienable right to organise; further notes that the affected trade unions were objecting to the oil law currently being proposed which would effectively transfer control of Iraq&rsquo;s oil reserves to multinational companies for the next 30 years, and further notes that the citizens of democratic nations have the right to protest against the usurpation of vital national resources regardless of inconvenience to the plans of governments or multinational companies.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-347#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Maintenance of Common Land on Scottish Housing Estates</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the many complaints voiced by people throughout Scotland over the neglect of common land on their housing estates, such as Gryffe Castle in Bridge of Weir and Inch Meadows/Roseland Brae in Erskine, even although some residents pay upwards of &pound;400 per annum for the maintenance of such areas of land adjacent to their homes; notes that many of these complainers accuse the Greenbelt Group, in particular, of failing to honour its obligations to householders in relation to the company&rsquo;s maintenance of local common land; is of the view that this company and others engaged in this service should aim for the very best standards of performance, which is a legitimate demand made by householders, and, in addition to the enhancement of these maintenance standards, firmly believes in the examination of alternative management procedures and practices, such as the common hold system, which would enable the community of householders to be given more control of the common land surrounding or adjacent to their homes.</p>
