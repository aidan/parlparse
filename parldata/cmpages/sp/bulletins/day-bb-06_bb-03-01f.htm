<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;
  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4039</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Shirley McKie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees with Lord McCluskey, retired High Court judge and former Solicitor General for Scotland, that one of the fundamental principles underlying the rule of law in a mature democracy is the principle that justice must be seen to be done; considers that in the case of Shirley McKie issues have arisen implying that justice has not been seen to be done, and, in further agreeing with Lord McCluskey that the issues involved are not party political but go to the heart of public trust in the criminal justice system, calls on the Scottish Executive to consider how the concerns expressed by Lord McCluskey should be addressed.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4038</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Fight the Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the CD, &quot;Fight the Power, defendiendo el socialism&quot;, featuring poet and rap artist Benjamin Zephaniah, King Biscuit Time, Rodney P, Braintax, Skinnyman, Emmanuel feat KRS1 and many more, which was created by the afore-mentioned artists on their initiative in response to the undemocratic ban of four Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) MSPs who stood up for democracy and the right to protest against the leaders and actions of the G8; expresses gratitude for such a tremendous show of solidarity, support and understanding for the protest; regrets that such a fundraising initiative has been necessary to ensure that no one suffers hardship from the removal of &pound;30,000 from the four MSPs&rsquo; salaries and allowances, including employees reliant on that funding from the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body; congratulates the artists for their political principles and their performances; notes that in the face of another undemocratic ban, Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London has stated that &quot;This decision strikes at the heart of democracy&hellip;.Elected politicians should only be able to be removed by the voters&quot;; endorses that view, and calls on all MSPs who took such draconian action against the four SSP MSPs to acknowledge the rash, unfair and undemocratic nature of their action, apologise accordingly and make reparations by purchasing a CD. <strong><em>R</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4036</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, despite assurances from ministers that Scottish Water&rsquo;s investment plans were on target, the Chairman of Scottish Water has resigned due to disagreements with ministers and Scottish Water has been required to produce another business plan; considers that these events highlight poor stewardship of the water industry by the Scottish Executive; expresses its concern over the impact of delays in investment in water and sewerage infrastructure on economic, environmental and social development in Scotland, and calls on the Executive to set out promptly what impact these events will have on delivering the ministerial objectives for the water industry in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4028</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Hearts and Hibs Semi-Final Game in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the semi-final draw for the 2006 Scottish Cup sees Hearts playing Hibs in the first all-Edinburgh semi-final for over 100 years; urges the Scottish Football Association (SFA) to stage the match in Edinburgh; believes that Murrayfield Stadium would be an ideal venue for the tie; further believes that fans of both sides would welcome such a decision and that the time and money saved by 60,000 people travelling through to Glasgow would be better spent in making the day a truly remarkable one for fans in the Lothians and east of Scotland, and urges the SFA to take into account the views of the people who matter most, the fans of Hearts and Hibs, and let democracy have its day.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4027</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Cut the Strings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Jubilee Scotland&rsquo;s Cut the Strings campaign and its call for an end to attaching harmful economic policy conditions to debt relief; notes that, despite it now being UK policy not to attach harmful conditions, such as privatisation, trade liberalisation and cuts in social spending to aid, debt relief is still made subject to World Bank or IMF conditions that undermine democracy and delay delivering resources needed to alleviate poverty, and believes that the United Kingdom should take a lead by delivering debt relief without harmful conditions.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4026</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Move Scottish Cup Semi-Final to Murrayfield</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hearts and Hibs on reaching the Scottish Cup semi-final; agrees with many supporters of each club that this match should be played in Edinburgh, and calls on the Scottish Football Association to move the game to Murrayfield so that 15,000 more fans could attend the game and to prevent travel chaos when 50,000 supporters try to get to Hampden from Edinburgh.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4025</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Andy Murray British Number 1</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Andy Murray on becoming the British number 1, overtaking fellow Brits, Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, and being propelled to 42nd in the tennis world rankings after recent success, including beating world-class players such as Andy Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt when winning his first ATP Tour title at the SAP Open in San Jose; believes that his skill and determination shown on the tennis court will inspire many young Scots to take up tennis, and believes that the Scottish Executive, in partnership with schools and parents, should encourage the uptake of more sport and activity for youngsters during and after school.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4024.1</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Regeneration in Scotland - People and Place</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4024) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that after some seven years of this Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition and the launch of yet another glossy brochure littered with self-evident axioms, one in four Scottish children and one in five pensioners remain in poverty; further notes that tens of thousands of young people remain not in education, training or employment and that 39,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in the first three years of this government and that, according to a report in <em>The Herald </em>on 28 February 2006, a spokesman for the First Minister stated regarding regeneration,&quot;England has jumped ahead of us on this. This is us getting our act together&quot;; therefore welcomes the Finance Committee&rsquo;s inquiry on deprivation spending, to report at the end of March, and recognises that, had the Scottish people not been deliberately misled about the impact of the energy reserves in the 1970s and the economic and social prospects of independence, poverty in Scotland would have been made history.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4024.2</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Regeneration in Scotland - People and Place</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4024) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the publication of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s statement &quot;People and Place: Regeneration Policy in Scotland&quot;; further notes that under the Executive&rsquo;s stewardship the gap between the poorest and rich in our society is widening, as shown in recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation figures, and that the number of working-age adults without dependent children who are in income poverty has increased from around 300,000 in the mid-1990s to almost 400,000 in recent years; believes that the key to tackling poverty is to have a thriving economy where people can find secure employment, and accordingly calls on the Executive to create an environment for businesses to invest in Scotland by reducing the burden of regulation and tax and by investing in our infrastructure.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4018</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Labour Party&rsquo;s New Policy on Nuclear Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision taken by the Labour Party in Scotland at its Aviemore conference to support the building of new nuclear power stations in Scotland;* *believes the decision was taken as a result of pressure from UK Ministers in London to support nuclear power; further believes that, rather than opt for new nuclear power stations and a dangerous, dirty and expensive technology, Scotland should instead be doing everything possible to promote our nation as a centre of excellence for genuinely clean and safe energy technologies, and further believes that Labour&rsquo;s support for nuclear can only undermine efforts to turn Scotland into a renewables powerhouse.</p>
