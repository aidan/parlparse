<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2878</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Dignity for Palestinians</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the passage of the boat, Dignity, which travelled from Cyprus to Gaza with 11 European parliamentarians including three members of the Scottish Parliament on board; recognises that this is the third boat to challenge the siege of Gaza, which has become a permanent blockade and which has affected every aspect of Palestinian life to the point where they are now in receipt of the largest food aid programme in the world; is concerned about the impact of the blockade on ordinary Palestinians, denying them basic health care rights as there is a shortage of medicine, proper medical equipment and severe restrictions on leaving Gaza for referral treatment, which has resulted in many deaths as recorded by the World Health Organisation; supports the efforts of Edinburgh Direct Aid to send aid to Gaza, and calls on the international community to act to lift the siege of Gaza, implement international law and to encourage long-term peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2877</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Larkhall Academy Unite Scotland - Let&rsquo;s Celebrate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the students of S6 in Larkhall Academy on their exciting Unite Scotland initiative, aimed at celebrating Scotland&rsquo;s cultural diversity and raising at least &pound;20,000 as part of the Prince&rsquo;s Trust Scholar Challenge; welcomes the group&rsquo;s ethos of&nbsp;&quot;Unite Scotland &ndash;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s Celebrate!&quot; and the range of activities planned as part of the initiative, including the selling of specially designed badges, and encourages everyone in the wider community to support these efforts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2876</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>UK Government&rsquo;s Ideas for the Future of the Post Office</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes comments by the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, Lord Mandelson, that he believes in the future of the Post Office and that the financial services it offers could be developed in the light of global economic difficulties; considers that the Network Change Programme was foisted on the Post Office by the UK Government and has decimated the Post Office branch network in Scotland, devastated local communities and put increasing pressure on the remaining branches; believes that any decision to remove the card account from the Post Office will further weaken the network; further believes that these actions of the UK Government stand completely at odds with Lord Mandelson&rsquo;s comments, and calls on the UK Government to halt and reverse the closure programme, retain the Post Office card account, and work to enhance the range of services available at all branches.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2875</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Vale of Leven Nurse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Linda Harley, a cardiac rehabilitation nurse at the Vale of Leven Hospital, on receiving the Heart Disease Team Award at the Scottish Health Awards 2008 after being nominated by her colleagues; recognises her dedication to helping heart attack sufferers in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area over the last 30 years; further recognises the outstanding work she has done to aid patients in their recovery, such as visiting them at home and going out of her way to tailor programmes to the needs of individual sufferers, and further congratulates her on her achievement, which has benefited many local patients.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2874</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>SNP in a Spin over HBOS Takeover</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the moves by a small group of people within the Scottish financial sector to promote an unspecified alternative to the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS; considers that the Lloyds TSB deal is the only substantive option that will guarantee the future of HBOS; unites with all parliamentarians, across parliaments, on the common purpose of securing headquarter functions in Scotland, preserving the thousands of jobs reliant on a strong recapitalised bank, both in the Lothians and across Scotland; further considers that there is a lack of coherent and transparent Scottish Government policy towards the takeover and a fast and loose approach adopted by some sections of the media to reporting the credibility of alternative options; considers that the whole scheme is deeply irresponsible, and believes that Alex Neil MSP is acting as a proxy for the First Minister in promoting the scheme and that his actions are politically motivated to allow the SNP to look both ways on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2873#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Successful Mercy Mission to Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the success of the European Campaign to End the Siege on Gaza and the Free Gaza Movement on their successful mission to break the blockade of Gaza and deliver much needed medical supplies and equipment to the people of Gaza; notes that alongside politicians from around Europe, such as Claire Short MP and Lord Nazir Ahmed, the successful delegation included Sandra White MSP, Pauline McNeill MSP and Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell MSP; further notes that, after the refusal of the Egyptian authorities to provide safe passage, the group successfully sailed from Cyprus to Gaza despite the close attention of the Israeli navy; hopes that these actions will give hope to the many Palestinians throughout the world, including Glasgow, that the blockade will be ended, and believes that only by all parties working together can we resolve this issue, which is causing untold suffering to the ordinary people of Gaza.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2872</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Management Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes, from an article in the <em>Sunday Herald </em>on 27 September 2008, that the Chief Executive has commissioned a report from Turner and Townsend Management Solutions, a group of construction and management consultants, with the remit to produce proposals that will assist in laying the foundations for an optimal senior management structure in the Scottish Parliamentary Service; while welcoming the commissioning and completion of this report, regrets that MSPs were not informed about it and are being denied access to it; believes that the refusal to publish this report runs contrary to the founding principles of the Parliament with respect to openness, transparency and accessibility, and demands that the report be made available immediately.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2868</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Back to a Life Stroke Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Back to a Life survey of stroke survivors report; calls on the Scottish Government to listen to the views of the large number of people in Scotland with communication difficulties following a stroke and who responded to the survey; recognises the impact, following a stroke, of communication difficulties on people&rsquo;s lives; supports the development of more, improved and better integrated communication support services in hospitals and in communities; further supports the development of accessible public communication services throughout communities and the establishment of accurate data collection processes to better evaluate and inform local communications service planning, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a firm commitment to act on these issues in Scotland&rsquo;s refreshed Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke Strategy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2867</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Free Hospital Transport in Renfrewshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of a free hospital transport service for Renfrewshire residents, to be piloted until 31 March 2009; congratulates Renfrewshire Council, Renfrewshire Community Health Partnership, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the WRVS and Community Transport Glasgow on the scheme, which will provide a no-cost means of accessing hospitals for elderly, disabled, and low-income individuals, and notes that the service is also a solution for those fearful of travelling unaccompanied at night that can only encourage relatives of patients to visit more frequently.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2866</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>UK Opt-out on the European Working Time Directive</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its dismay that the UK Government is seeking to maintain the opt-out to the European working time directive, which aims to protect the rights of workers throughout the European Union, and endorses the stance adopted by the European Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the GMB trade union to scrap the UK opt-out clause.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2865</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Dalziel High</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dalziel High School, one of the first schools to go through the new inspection process, on achieving an outstanding report with three excellent ratings for improvements in performance, meeting learning needs and improvement through self-evaluation, and two very good ratings for learners&rsquo; experiences and improvements through self-evaluation, and commends the school for the examples of good practice outlined in its tutor and buddy support system and its work with the community and with the Dalziel High School War Memorial Trust to develop and run sporting facilities as well as an extensive programme of extra-curricular activities.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2862.3</strong> <strong>Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Scottish Futures Trust</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2862) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;notes actions&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Government has failed to deliver a workable method of funding for public infrastructure projects, a view supported by, among others, the building industry, the financial services community and the trades unions; considers that this damaging hiatus is costing jobs and harming the Scottish economy, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to bring an end to its Scottish Futures Trust proposals immediately.&quot;</p>
