<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3771</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Justice for Local Government Pension Scheme Members</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern proposals that the Scottish Public Pensions Agency should follow the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) negotiations which are taking place in England and Wales; further notes that this would result in the removal of the 85 Rule from 1 April 2006 and would end protection for existing scheme members, as well as resulting in a 1% increase in employee contributions and an increase in the age at which benefits can be taken from 50 to 55, and urges the Minister for Finance and Public Service Reform to state unequivocally that Scottish LGPS members will be treated in the same way as other public sector workers.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3770</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Police Action on Rendition Flights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision by the Association of Chief Police Officers in England to begin a formal investigation into allegations that CIA rendition flights are transporting suspects via Scottish and UK airports to prisons where they are being allegedly subjected to torture and, in some cases, death and considers that Scottish police chief constables should act immediately and launch a parallel investigation to ensure that Scotland is not complicit in suspected US torture and death flights.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3769</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Unsung Sports Hero</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates 16-year-old Ruaridh Hughes, from Ullapool, on winning BBC Radio Scotland&rsquo;s Sports Weekly Unsung Hero award for his achievements in running, coaching and fundraising for Lochbroom Shinty Club and offers support and appreciation to sports coaches throughout the country who turn out, unpaid and at their own expense, to coach young and old, elite and beginner, in good weather and bad, providing motivation, enjoyment, health and purpose to thousands of Scots in hundreds of sports.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alex Johnstone<strong>*</strong>, Mr Alasdair Morrison<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Trish Godman<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, Colin Fox<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3768</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>First ScotRail Lets Down Christmas Shoppers in Fife Yet Again</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes there are people living outside Edinburgh who regularly use the train as their preferred mode of transport to the capital city instead of taking their cars; is concerned to learn that on 10 December 2005, in the run-up to the busy Christmas period, dozens of Christmas shoppers in the west Fife area faced misery at Inverkeithing train station as a lack of train capacity left them standing on the platform fuming when a tannoy announcement suddenly told them, without any prior warning, that the train was full and that they would not be allowed on the train; notes that there has been more than a 30% growth in passengers using trains in the last five years, and believes that, if this mode of transport is to attract people from their cars, then First ScotRail requires to ensure that, above all, reliable and adequate train capacity will be put in place, otherwise travellers will resort to the use of their cars instead.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3767.1</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Blood Products</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3767) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;accepts&quot; to end and insert &quot;extends its sympathy to those infected with Hepatitis C through contaminated blood products; welcomes the move to place information in the public domain, and believes at this moment in time that the best way to get clear decisive answers would be for those campaigners to bring forward a test case to the courts.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3767.2</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Blood Products</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3767) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses its profound sympathy for those patients who have been infected with Hepatitis C through NHS treatment with blood or blood products; welcomes the payments which are being made by the Scottish Executive to help with the suffering and hardship involved; notes that there have been significant improvements in knowledge and in the safety of blood products since these events took place; believes that there is now more information in the public domain and that the debate has moved on, and believes that the focus should now be on practical action which would benefit the future delivery of services or patient care.&quot;</p>
