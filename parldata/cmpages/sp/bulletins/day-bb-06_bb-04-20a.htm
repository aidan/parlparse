<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
      
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Socialist Party Debate: Statutory Right to Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-4252</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Statutory Right to Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing social and human cost of drug misuse across Scotland and that past and current policy approaches have failed communities, drug users and their families miserably; regrets the fact that drug-related crime, premature death and family breakdowns continue to rise; believes that the predominant criminal justice-oriented approach to drug-misuse problems in Scotland is not only failing to address the problems but is actually counter-productive in diverting resources and attention away from treatment and rehabilitation; further believes that a predominantly social and health-led approach is now necessary and that a statutory right to a holistic treatment and care plan should be established within a seven-day period of seeking help and should include residential care where required; considers that the introduction of such a statutory right would not only lead to improved care for users and their families, but result in significant crime reduction within communities and subsequent net savings to the public purse; further considers that cannabis use in Scotland should be decriminalised but not encouraged, that debate on the legal status of other drugs must be promoted and that substitute prescription programmes, such as the provision of heroin or buprenorphine for treatment of appropriate users, should be introduced and supported across Scotland, and believes that significant investment in community and sporting facilities to tackle poverty and offer positive recreational activities to Scotland&rsquo;s young people is an essential but under-invested element of anti-drug abuse strategy. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-4252.4</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry: Statutory Right to Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4252) in the name of Ms Rosemary Byrne, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert&nbsp;&quot;recognises that drug abuse destroys lives and tears families apart; believes that improved treatment and rehabilitation should be at the heart of our approach;&nbsp;further believes that there is need to help addicts to move towards a drug-free lifestyle by offering a range of interventions; welcomes the progress made but recognises that more needs to be done, particularly to make sure that treatment is linked to further support, and believes that early intervention is the most effective way of helping offenders and reducing drug-related crime.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-4252.3</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Statutory Right to Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4252) in the name of Ms Rosemary Byrne, leave out from &quot;the continuing&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the cost to communities, drug addicts and their families, and the public purse of drug misuse remains unacceptably high; believes that a range of interventions must be available to addicts across Scotland that are tailored to their individual needs; encourages the Scottish Executive to give further support to efforts to recover assets from drug barons; recognises that drug abuse is primarily a health issue but that intervention from the criminal justice system will often be the first opportunity for users to start on the road to recovery, and, in the absence of any compelling evidence, does not believe that any relaxation of the rules on drug misuse would do other than exacerbate current problems.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-4252.1</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie: Statutory Right to Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4252) in the name of Ms Rosemary Byrne, leave out from &quot;the predominant&quot; to end and insert &quot;we need a drugs strategy which aims to reduce and ultimately eliminate drugs dependency in Scotland and that such a strategy should place an emphasis on early intervention and include a coherent education programme which prioritises abstinence, and further believes that there needs to be a radical change in the help offered to drug addicts, to provide counselling and rehabilitation rather than an over-reliance on methadone.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-4252.2</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: Statutory Right to Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4252) in the name of Ms Rosemary Byrne, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets the continuing economic and social cost of alcohol and drug abuse across Scotland and calls on the Scottish Executive to establish a commission of investigation into such misuse.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Socialist Party Debate: Local Government Pensions Dispute&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-4253</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Local Government Pensions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s announcement on 17 January 2006 to abolish the Rule of 85 for members of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) in Scotland; recognises that the proposed changes will have a detrimental impact on many working people who support vital public services, often on low wages, in a wide range of occupations in Scotland, including workers in local government, the Environment Agency, police support, cleaning and waste companies, the voluntary sector, bus companies, higher education and others; notes that this decision means that LGPS members are denied the same rights and protections as members of other public sector pension schemes which have agreed to allow retirement at the age of 60 on a full pension; further notes recent comments made by EU Commissioners on this issue indicating that changes to the Rule of 85 would not necessarily be a requirement under EU legislation and previous assurances given to COSLA and the relevant trade unions that the Rule of 85 for members of the LGPS in Scotland would be retained; recognises that members of the LGPS contribute to the scheme and want to ensure that there is a viable and sustainable future for it; further recognises that the financial standing of Scotland&rsquo;s LGPS is significantly healthier than schemes elsewhere in the UK and therefore calls for a distinctive approach, and further calls on the Executive to review and publish its legal advice regarding the Rule of 85 and to work with trade unions and COSLA to find a settlement which protects local government workers&rsquo; pension rights. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>S2M-4253.1</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe: Local Government Pensions</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4253) in the name of Colin Fox, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;the current issues surrounding the future of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS); recognises that these issues will impact on a wide range of public sector workers; recognises that members of the LGPS contribute to this scheme and want to ensure that there is a viable and sustainable future for it; notes that the correct manner for dealing with the consequences of any changes to the LGPS, or any disagreement in legal opinion in respect of it, is through open and fair discussion with trade unions, employers and the Scottish Public Pensions Agency, and therefore welcomes the decision of the trade unions to suspend strike action as a result of the constructive dialogue which is currently taking place.&quot;</p>
