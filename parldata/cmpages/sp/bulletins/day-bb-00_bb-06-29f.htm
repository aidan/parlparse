    <p align="left"><font FACE="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1067</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Essential User
    Fuel Duty Rebate</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that, as a consequence of high
    taxation, the cost of providing fuel for road haulage companies in Scotland is double that
    of our European neighbours; notes that, as a consequence, the number of road miles
    travelled by lorry has not been reduced, merely that Scottish drivers and operators are
    being undercut and displaced by continental drivers and operators, and that across
    Scotland the cost of goods is rising to reflect increasing transport costs; further notes
    the answer to question S1W-7586 by Sarah Boyack on 26 June 2000, indicating that the
    Scottish Executive would carefully consider any proposals by the Road Haulage Association
    for an essential user rebate; therefore draws the attention of the Scottish Executive to
    the proposals published by the Road Haulage Association for an essential user rebate for
    fuel duty, a scheme which would ensure that on valid business journeys the cost of fuel to
    Scottish operators was brought into line with the cost of fuel to our nearest continental
    neighbours, by rebating the excess taxation charged here, and calls upon the Scottish
    Executive to publish a detailed consideration of the impacts and benefits of such a
    scheme.</font></p>
    <font FACE="Arial"><p align="left"><strong>*S1M-1066#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie: Technology and
    Customer Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the use of new technology in the
    public and private sectors; notes however that advances in technology, such as the use of
    voicemail or pre-recorded messages to direct a customer through a telephone system, should
    not be used as a substitute for direct customer service, and believes that the businesses
    and residents of Dunfermline East should be given the option of talking directly to a
    person to have their concerns addressed promptly.,</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>*S1M-1065 Mr Tom McCabe on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business
    Motion</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that for Stage 3 of the Education and Training
    (Scotland) Bill, debate on each part of the proceedings, if not previously brought to a
    conclusion, shall be brought to a conclusion at the following times &#150;</p>
    <p align="left">Amendments &#150; no later than 1 hour 30 minutes after Stage 3 begins</p>
    <p align="left">Motion to pass the Bill &#150; no later than 2 hours after Stage 3 begins.

    <p align="left">Supported by: Iain Smith<strong>*</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>*S1M-1064</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Ferguson Shipbuilders and Western
    Ferries</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a NAME="MotionText">warmly congratulates the
    management and workforce of Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd., Port Glasgow, for securing a
    contract to build a passenger ferry vessel for Western Ferries; is of the view that this
    important order demonstrates, in the clearest possible way, that the Port Glasgow yard
    deservedly enjoys a first class reputation as a builder of specialist vessels, and
    believes that this contract will be followed by others which will enable the yard to
    sustain its important role in both the Inverclyde economy and the United Kingdom
    shipbuilding industry.</a></p>

    an amendment to motion (S1M-1051) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;the
    steps&quot; to end and insert &quot;steps being taken to secure a sustainable future for
    the agricultural industry as part of the social, economic and environmental fabric of
    rural Scotland; recognises agriculture as the main economic driver in rural Scotland;
    deplores the lack of urgency being shown by the Scottish Executive in addressing the
    short-term problems of Scotland&#146;s farmers, and calls for a speedy conclusion to the

    Common Agricultural Policy will be a major factor affecting the future of Scottish
    agriculture and regrets that, under the current constitutional settlement, Scotland will
