            stated that there were, for the year 1999-2000, 1672 very sheltered

            that based on the latest research available the requirement for very 
            sheltered accommodation for older people is 23 dwellings per 1000 
            of the older population; acknowledges that Age Concern estimates a 
            requirement in the order of 18,055 such dwellings, and therefore believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should immediately commission a report 
            to confirm very sheltered housing requirements and undertake that 
            the report will be published within the next parliamentary year.</font></p>
