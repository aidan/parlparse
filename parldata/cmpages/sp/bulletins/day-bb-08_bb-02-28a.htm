  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-1434.2</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Improving Accountability</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1434) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from &quot;oversight of the Scottish Ministerial code&quot; to end and insert &quot;authority to direct ministers in the appropriate arrangements for ensuring that their conduct as ministers is in accordance with the Scottish Ministerial Code to avoid conflict or potential conflict of interest, and to oversee its administration, and to bring forward a statement to the Parliament on this when the review is concluded.&quot; </p>

      <p> <strong>S3M-1432.1.1</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Children&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to amendment (S3M-1432.1) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, after &quot;Professor James Fraser;&quot; insert &quot;; rejects the blanket retention of DNA samples and fingerprints;&quot;. </p>
