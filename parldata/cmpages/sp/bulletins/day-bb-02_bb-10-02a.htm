Site</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes that BAA Lynton has earmarked the 
former RAF Turnhouse site or &quot;Airwest&quot; for medium- to long-term commercial 
development in support of the expanding cargo operations at Edinburgh Airport 
following the grant of outline planning consent in June 2000; further notes that 
the entire site is currently being marketed to potential commercial occupiers 
for a variety of airport-related uses; expresses its concern that Home Office 
plans for a possible accommodation centre for asylum seekers on that site are 
creating uncertainty and thus the site is in danger of becoming blighted, and 
therefore believes that the Scottish Executive and the City of Edinburgh Council 
should ask the Home Office to state clearly that it has no interest in the site 
and thereby permit BAA Lynton to proceed with its plans which are in the best 
interest of jobs and economic development in Edinburgh and the east of Scotland.
