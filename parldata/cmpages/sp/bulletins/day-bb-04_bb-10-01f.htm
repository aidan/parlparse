          <P><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></P>
          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1815</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>New Kerbside Recycling Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the new kerbside recycling service recently adopted by East Ayrshire Council, South Lanarkshire Council and other local authorities throughout Scotland, and which is intended to encourage the necessary and worthwhile commitment to responsible waste management, is being undermined and is threatening the enthusiasm and goodwill of local communities to co-operate as a result of the unhygienic practice of only collecting household residual waste, which cannot be recycled or reused, on a fortnightly basis instead of weekly.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1814</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Crisis in Urological Services in the Borders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with alarm the terms of the letter dated 23 September 2004 from John S O&rsquo;Neill, Head of General and Specialist Surgery at the Borders General Hospital (BGH), to Dr Grahame Howard, Chairman of the SCAN Urology Group at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh which states &quot;In 2001 we (BGH) appointed Ian Mitchell to the Urology Network with the plan that he lead a local service in the Borders, but would also have sessions in Edinburgh to develop his special interest in lower urinary tract cancers &hellip; After the first year his in-patient operating would gradually be accommodated in Lothian. Since his appointment there has been no increase in capacity in Lothian &hellip; [and that] In the last 18 months we have been forced to send 50 urology patients to the private sector for surgery&quot;; notes that these conditions alone have cost the BGH &pound;200,000; notes that Mr O&rsquo;Neill goes on to state that &quot;in a recent review of SCAN, GPs&rsquo; views of cancer services urology received the lowest rating of all cancer services with the Borders service receiving particular criticism, particularly in relation to waiting times&quot;; further notes that Mr Mitchell has now resigned because of the lack of progress being made and that NHS Borders has been told that it will have no access to any lists or clinics in Lothian and that &quot;We (BGH) are therefore facing a crisis in provision of urological services for the Borders region&quot;; notes that there are currently 121 in-patients awaiting admission for surgery, 30 of whom have waited between six and nine months, that 28 patients are awaiting prostatic biopsies for suspected cancer and that some of those have been waiting more than seven months and that 92 out-patients are awaiting appointments, and asserts that this is wholly unacceptable and that the Scottish Executive should intervene on all these matters so that an acceptable service can be accessed by Borders patients.</P>
