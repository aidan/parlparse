<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6615 Jackie Baillie: Keep Leuchie House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision to close Leuchie House; notes that Leuchie House is the only respite home operating in Scotland and northern England for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is one of only four across the United Kingdom; believes that the level of care given at Leuchie House is exceptional; notes that the facility that it offers MS patients to holiday with their carer and their children is unique; notes that it has continually achieved the maximum evaluation of excellent in every area of inspection by the Care Commission; recognises that Leuchie House is much valued by service users; believes that the closure of such a specialised facility will cause a strain on families and other services, such as the NHS, as they struggle to cope with the needs of MS patients, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure the continuation of the facility.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6614 Jamie Hepburn: Ambassadors for Peace Awards for Airdrie and Coatbridge Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Airdrie Academy and St Margaret&rsquo;s High School in Airdrie as well as Coatbridge High and St Ambrose schools in Coatbridge, which are due to receive Ambassadors for Peace certificates later this month; notes the work that the pupils and the schools have undertaken to achieve this award; thanks Sense over Sectarianism, Strathclyde Police, Albion Rovers and Pat Rolink for their involvement and support for the scheme, and acknowledges the Ambassadors for Peace scheme as an excellent scheme for schools to work toward.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6613 Sarah Boyack: Break the Silence, Buy Radios for Burma</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been under military rule since 1962 when the parliamentary government was overthrown by an army coup; believes that access to a radio could help a family or community learn about their rights and let them hear of the international solidarity that Burma&rsquo;s military regime works so hard to block out; further believes that freedom of information and expression is a fundamental human right that empowers individuals and communities to learn about and strive for justice and a whole range of other rights and freedoms, and therefore welcomes the new initiative by Amnesty International to mark the 65th birthday of the pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, by supplying radios to the people of Burma as a means of empowering them through access to crucial information that radios provide.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6612 Ian McKee: Edinburgh Tenants Federation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Edinburgh Tenants Federation in its 20th anniversary year for winning the nationally acclaimed Frances Nelson Award for its pioneering work to improve services for high-rise block tenants with mental health difficulties; notes that, over the past four years, the organisation has focused on developing mental health services for tenants following two tragic suicide events in high-rise blocks; commends the organisation&rsquo;s efforts for creating a mental health working group with the City of Edinburgh Council and a number of agencies across Scotland, which resulted in the provision of training for over 200 council staff in suicide awareness, increased support and material for frontline staff and the launch of a mental health awareness campaign; considers that its services have become significant to many community groups in Edinburgh, and hopes that other tenant groups across Scotland can learn from the processes that have lead to the establishment of these crucial mental health services.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6611 Jackie Baillie: Happy 20th Birthday to Dumbarton Credit Union</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dumbarton Credit Union on its 20th anniversary; notes the growth of the credit union to 2,500 adult members and 400 junior account holders; warmly acknowledges the links that has developed with schools and welcomes the further enhancement of this work; further welcomes the extension of its common bond to include Helensburgh and Lomond alongside Dumbarton; recognises the valuable work that it does in providing low-rate interest loans and free insurance on savings to all members; congratulates all those involved in founding and running Dumbarton Credit Union over the years, and looks forward to the next 20 years.</p>

<p> <strong>* S3M-6609 Bill Wilson: Tackling Traffickers and Helping Trafficked People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group report,<em> Wrong kind of victim? One year on: an analysis of UK measures to protect trafficked persons</em>; is dismayed that it found that the UK Government has yet to satisfactorily implement the entirety of its obligations under the Council of Europe&rsquo;s<em> Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings</em>, that the National Referral Mechanism is apparently failing to meet the needs of people who have suffered abuse and trauma and that the system has not facilitated prosecutions and bypasses the UK&rsquo;s framework to safeguard children; congratulates Strathclyde Police and Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, however, on the report&rsquo;s statement that participants had highlighted the fact that these forces had made good progress on addressing trafficking, and calls on the relevant institutions in the UK to share best practice and implement all the report&rsquo;s recommendations as soon as possible.</p>

<p> <strong>* S3M-6608 Stuart McMillan: Action Mesothelioma Day, 2nd July 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the fifth annual Action Mesothelioma Day, on 2 July, to raise awareness of the disease and improve the treatment and care of it; notes the dedication of charities such as Clydeside Action on Asbestos that, this National Mesothelioma Day, are hosting the first ever day for patients and carers; acknowledges that the Scottish Parliament has an excellent record of supporting those with asbestos-related conditions, as evidenced by the passing of Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Act 2008, and recognises the importance of this day as many individuals and families living in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been affected by exposure to asbestos.</p>

<p> <strong>* S3M-6607 Bob Doris: Reducing VAT on Educational e-Resources</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the current practice of applying full-rate VAT at 17.5% on electronic resources such as e-journals, e-books and online databases; recognises that e-resources are increasingly important to the education sector, are particularly vital to the sciences and technology and are increasingly being used as core materials in the arts and humanities; notes that, according to the British Universities Finance Directors&rsquo; Group (BUFDG), library VAT costs in a typical research institution amount to &pound;175,000 per annum and that in larger institutions this figure is far higher; supports calls from BUFDG in advance of the UK budget for VAT in this area to be reduced in common with recent developments in other European countries, including a reduced rate of 4% in Spain and proposals to reduce VAT to 6% in the Netherlands; believes that the estimated &pound;10 million cost to universities across the United Kingdom of having full-rate VAT applied to e-resources is significant and will become a yet greater burden in future years as usage increases and the constrained financial environment intensifies; considers that a VAT reduction on e-resources would do much to encourage research, and urges the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider well founded claims that such a reduction in VAT may be either revenue-neutral or positive in the longer term.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6606 Jackie Baillie: West Dunbartonshire Trio Going to Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Jennifer Davidson, Ross MacPherson and Laura Young on being selected to represent West Dunbartonshire and Scotland in the Commonwealth Games handover ceremony in India; notes that the trio will join other ambassadors from across Scotland to take part in a special ceremony in New Dehli in October 2010 to mark the official handover from India to Glasgow, the 2014 host; understands that the trio was selected on the back of significant voluntary work that they have carried out in the area, and wishes them all the best in representing the population of West Dunbartonshire in front of a global audience come October.</p>

<p> <strong>* S3M-6603 Mary Scanlon: Congratulations to Buckie RNLI on 150 Years of Life-saving Tradition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all involved in the Buckie Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year; commends this station, which was established in 1860 with the first boat named Miriam, which saw her first service on 2 December 1861, since which time Buckie has been the home to a further eight RNLI lifeboats, including the current Severn-class lifeboat, the William Blannin, which has been in service since may 2003; further commends all current and past crew and volunteers of this station for their dedication and commitment to saving lives, with the Buckie RNLI volunteer crew the busiest in the north east in 2009; notes that Buckie RNLI has received many bravery commendations over the years including being awarded a plaque of merit and a diploma by the Swedish Lifeboat Society when it rescued 19 crew of the Stockholm steamer, Frej; recognises the many other lives that have been saved by crew from this lifeboat station over the last 150 years as a result of the gallantry and commitment of the volunteers, and wishes continued success to the entire RNLI movement, which relies solely on public generosity to continue its 24/7 life-saving search and rescue work.</p>

<p> <strong>* S3M-6602 Willie Coffey: Another Hat Trick for Kilmarnock and Loudoun Footballers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hurlford Thistle on winning the Lindsay Fencing (Irvine) Ayrshire Amateur Premier League; notes that Hurlford won 15 of its 16 matches, scoring 63 goals and conceding only 15, and further notes that with Galston United finishing as runners-up and Knockentiber in third place, this made it yet another hat trick of team successes for amateur football in Kilmarnock and Loudoun.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6601 Christina McKelvie: MND Scotland&rsquo;s Field of Hope</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament declares its support for MND Scotland&rsquo;s online Field of Hope campaign, which is scheduled to take place during Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Awareness Week from 21 to 27 June 2010; notes that the campaign aims to plant a virtual field of blue cornflowers by encouraging people with a Facebook page or Twitter feed to incorporate a Twibbon of MND Scotland&rsquo;s blue cornflower logo in their profiles, which will link to a fundraising page; further notes that MND Scotland believes that each  &pound;1,000 raised through this campaign will be enough to provide a year of specialist care for one of the 373 people in Scotland who currently live with MND, and encourages everyone with a Facebook page or Twitter feed to plant their own cornflower in MND Scotland&rsquo;s Field of Hope from 21 June.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6600 Johann Lamont: Congratulations to Greater Pollok Young Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Greater Pollok Young Carers on the publication of its book, <em>What I do - Young Carers Voices</em>; notes that the book was written, designed and illustrated by the young carers themselves; acknowledges the pioneering work of the Greater Pollok Storytelling Centre and the Princess Royal Trust Greater Pollok Carers Centre in supporting the young people in this unique venture; celebrates the energy, compassion and thoughtfulness of the young people who speak of their experiences; recognises the power of the writing of these young people in giving a voice to their concerns and ambitions; believes that the young people are to be congratulated for speaking up and out about the needs of and challenges facing young carers, and believes that the message of this book should act as a spur to government at every level to meet the needs of carers of every age who do so much for their loved ones at huge cost to themselves.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6599 Willie Coffey: Math&eacute;matiques sans Fronti&egrave;res</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Math&eacute;matiques sans Fronti&egrave;res competition, the Scottish final of which was recently held at Heriot-Watt University, is a truly European annual event involving tens of thousands of students from all European countries; notes further that, in each country, one of the complex maths problems to be solved by participants is presented in a foreign language, with the Scottish competition featuring a problem outlined in French; congratulates all participants in the national final, who came from local authority and independent schools from all over Scotland, for their success in winning through to the final of a very challenging competition, and congratulates in particular the team from Stewarton Academy who fought off tough competition, dropping only one point in the process, to be declared outright winners.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6598 Anne McLaughlin: The Darker Side of the World Cup</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concerns raised by charities, such as Coalition against Trafficking in Women, and the United Nations Development Fund for Women regarding the increased demand for prostitution associated with the World Cup in South Africa; shares the concerns of South African officials regarding the dangers of an increase in people-trafficking associated with the World Cup as well as the exploitation and public health issues linked to the expected increase in prostitution; recognises the preventative measures undertaken by the South African Government to stop exploitation and hinder child trafficking; recognises that some organisations are raising the issue as a concern for the 2014 Commonwealth Games; urges the authorities to work against this threat, and, while wishing the World Cup every success as a sporting event, hopes that it raises awareness of the links that exploitation, trafficking and prostitution can have with large sporting events.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6597&diams;   Robert Brown: Future of Stow College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent undertakings by the Scottish Funding Council to support the Glasgow Central Colleges Amalgamation project; considers that this development is likely to have a negative impact on Stow College, which has withdrawn from the planned amalgamation; believes that the progress towards this new consortium will threaten Stow&rsquo;s ability to provide the valuable educational services currently proffered by the college to over 10,000 learners as resources will now be directed toward the new central facility; notes that Stow offers the most extensive range of SWAP Access programmes in Scotland, which are specifically designed to provide a route into higher education for mature adults with few or no qualifications; further notes that 40% of full-time students come from the most deprived areas in Scotland; congratulates Stow College on its 70 years of pursuing open access and social inclusion through its progressive educational outlook, and would welcome support for the continuing viability of Stow College.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6590 Dr Richard Simpson: In Recognition of Learning Disability Week, 21 to 27 June</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Learning Disability Week, which is scheduled to run from 21 to 27 June 2010; supports the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability&rsquo;s efforts in encouraging local campaigning and activities through its Get Active! pack; notes that the theme for Learning Disability Week 2010 is to ask people whether, 10 years after the publication of the groundbreaking <em>The same as you?</em> report, this has made a difference to people&rsquo;s lives, and commends the action taken by the consortium to ensure that progress that has been made is celebrated and that further action is taken through local campaigning where it is still to be achieved.</p>
