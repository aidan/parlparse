<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Teacher Numbers&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4910</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Teacher Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the most recent reduction in the number of teachers employed in Scotland revealed by the September 2009 public sector employment figures; further notes that this follows on from the Teachers in Scotland 2008 census, which showed that the number of teachers fell by nearly 1,000 on the previous year, and asks how this can be reconciled with the SNP&rsquo;s manifesto pledge and concordat commitment to maintain teacher numbers in the face of falling school rolls in order to cut class sizes; highlights with concern the <em>Times Educational Supplement Scotland</em> survey, published in August 2009, suggesting that only 15% of this year&rsquo;s newly qualified teachers had secured full-time permanent work at the start of the school term as well as the General Teaching Council Scotland follow up survey suggesting that, even half way through the 2008-09 school year, only around a third of the previous year&rsquo;s probationary teachers had found full-time permanent posts; believes that the Scottish Government has precipitated a teacher jobs crisis, forcing many of the most qualified new teachers in Scotland&rsquo;s history to look elsewhere in the United Kingdom or beyond for suitable employment; believes that this represents an appalling loss of talent to Scotland&rsquo;s education system and a gross betrayal of those enticed to train as teachers as well as those who voted SNP due to its election pledges on schools, and therefore calls on the SNP government to publish detailed plans of how it will deliver on its manifesto and concordat commitments on teacher numbers. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4910.3</strong> <strong>Keith Brown: Teacher Numbers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4910) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;the most recent&quot; to end and insert &quot;that Scotland benefits from a record low in average class size in primary schools, that the number of P1 to P3 pupils in classes of 18 or under is increasing and that the Scottish average primary class size is considerably smaller than those for England and Wales; welcomes the record levels of funding provided by the current administration to local government and the commitment set out in the concordat to reduce class sizes but notes that the employment of teachers is a matter for local authorities; welcomes the continuing commitment of the Scottish Government and local government to work together to make further progress on class size reduction; highlights with concern that the previous administration took no legislative action to support its class size reduction policy and notes the recently announced intention of the Scottish Government to introduce regulations for a maximum class size of 25 in P1 from the beginning of the 2010 school year and to review more generally how class sizes are governed, and also recognises the action of the Scottish Government to ensure a better balance between supply and demand of teachers.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4910.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Teacher Numbers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4910) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;; considers that the universal provision of free school meals in P1 to P3 will impact on the ability of councils to recruit and retain teachers, and believes that head teachers should have much greater say in the recruitment of teachers and other staff in their schools.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-4910.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Teacher Numbers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4910) in the name of Rhona Brankin, after &quot;class sizes&quot; insert &quot;; raises concern about the implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence in the face of falling teacher numbers; acknowledges that the previous administration increased the number of teachers by 4,600 between 1999 and 2007; notes the continued reduction in the number of full-time equivalent nursery teachers as shown in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Pre-school and Childcare Statistics 2009</em>&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Child Protection&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4911</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Child Protection</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the <em>Summary of Indicative Quality Indicator Results</em> <em>from HMIE Inspections</em>, published on 17 September 2009, showing that 23% of local authority child protection services in Scotland were evaluated as weak or unsatisfactory; further notes with similar concern the findings of the significant case review and review for chief officers reports into the death of Brandon Muir, revealing gaps and inaccuracies in the sharing of information between agencies concerned in his care and the terrible circumstances of his life as well as death; believes that the situation highlighted by these publications cannot be tolerated in a civilised society; acknowledges and commends the efforts and dedication of staff involved in the safety and care of Scotland&rsquo;s children, often under considerable pressure but believes that these reports confound the comments of the First Minister on 25 June 2009 that we have a very good child protection system in Scotland; recognises the initiative taken by the previous administration in tackling this problem by bringing together a series of actions contained in the Hidden Harm report; calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a report and to make a statement to the Parliament on the progress that it is making in implementing the recommendations of Hidden Harm and also what it is doing to build on those recommendations, and also calls on the Scottish Government to report to the Parliament on the steps it is taking to identify those children who are at risk as a result of living with parents or carers who are alcohol or substance misusers. </p>
