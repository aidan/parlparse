<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&#117;    ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>(<a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm</a>).  A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at: </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/index.htm"><strong>http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsAndAmendments/index.htm</strong></a></p>
<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4097</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Sportscotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the findings of a report by PMP Consultants that moving <strong>sport</strong>scotland from its current location in Edinburgh would result in the loss of personnel; understands that the particular expertise of <strong>sport</strong>scotland&rsquo;s professional and technical staff means that loss of personnel would make the agency&rsquo;s role more difficult to execute; is concerned that any move could be detrimental to Scotland&rsquo;s bid to host the Commonwealth Games in 2014, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should give further consideration to the case for retaining <strong>sport</strong>scotland at its current location.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4096</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Brain Injury Awareness Week: 13 to 19 March 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that brain injury is the biggest cause of death and disability amongst young people; recognises the shortage of specialist care and rehabilitation facilities in Scotland; supports the efforts by Headway, the brain injury association, to provide a range of services in the community to brain injury survivors and their carers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to acknowledge the extent of the problem and ensure that adequate resources are made available.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4095</strong> <strong>John Scott on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body:</strong> <strong>Appointment of the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner for a second period</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees with the recommendation of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body under Rule 3A.1.2 of Standing Orders that Dr James Dyer should be appointed for a second period as the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner with effect from 1 April 2006.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4094</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Paramedic Relief Squad</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposal to establish a Scottish paramedic relief squad, able to be deployed as a rapid response team at home or abroad in response to emergencies from communities and countries facing the immediate aftermath of disaster or tragedy; acknowledges that this will fill the void for on-the-scene medical care and transfer, complementing the work of international medical aid agencies; congratulates Jimmy McGrath, Gordon McNeil and Garry Fraser, who are paramedics, for developing this proposal; firmly believes that the Scottish Ambulance Service and the Scottish Executive should support the establishment of a Scottish paramedic relief squad as an additional valuable contribution to our international aid efforts, and, in particular, strongly encourages the Executive to consider providing assistance with equipment, training and start-up costs.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4093</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Prescription Charge Exemption for Cystic Fibrosis Sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that people with cystic fibrosis currently have to pay prescription charges as the condition is not presently on the exemption list; believes that this is an anomaly caused by the fact that previously cystic fibrosis sufferers had an average life expectancy that lasted only until childhood, and therefore it was considered that there was no need to include it as a condition on the exemption list; further believes that this should now be altered to reflect the fact that the average life expectancy of someone with cystic fibrosis is now 31 years, and calls on the Scottish Executive to include the condition on the exemption list for prescription charges.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4091#</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>RIP Cigarettes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that deaths resulting from fires, of which there were 99 in 2004, are a major concern in Scotland; recognises that they are significantly higher in Scotland than the rest of the United Kingdom and that the majority of fire deaths in Scotland occur in the West of Scotland; notes with concern that smoking materials are one of the leading causes of fires in Scotland and that 50% of all smoking-related fire deaths occur in the West of Scotland; believes that the Scottish Parliament should commit to actively pursuing policies aimed at reducing the number of fire deaths in the West of Scotland and within Scotland as a whole; recognises the role that Reduced Ignition Potential (RIP) cigarettes, commonly referred to as fire-safe cigarettes, could play in reducing damage to property as well as the overall number of fires, fire injuries and fire deaths; supports the implementation of a new fire safety law that would require all cigarettes sold in Scotland to be RIP cigarettes; welcomes the decision of the Chief Fire Officers&rsquo; Association in Scotland to support the call for the introduction of fire-safe cigarettes; congratulates Canada and New York for introducing such laws and recognises that the introduction of fire-safe cigarettes would have a significant and positive impact on the number of fire fatalities in Scotland, and believes that the Scottish government should bring forward legislation to introduce this fire safety measure as soon as possible in the hope that Scotland can truly say RIP to fires caused by cigarettes.</p>
