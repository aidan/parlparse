<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1238</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Importance of Scottish History in the School Curriculum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of ensuring that young people understand Scotland&rsquo;s and their place in the world, both currently and in a historical context, and in pursuit of this aim welcomes the opportunities for more exciting, engaging and relevant teaching presented by the Curriculum for Excellence and, in particular, the publication of the draft social studies outcomes and experiences by Learning and Teaching Scotland, along with the recent decision by the Scottish Qualifications Authority to include questions on Scottish history as a compulsory component of the Higher History examination.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1237</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Welcome Decision on Aviemore Resort</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the swift action taken by the Scottish Government in response to representations from a cross-party group of MSPs to address problems in the planning process between the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Cairngorms National Park Authority and developers of the Aviemore Highland Resort that allowed the Cairngorms National Park Authority to take a decision on the potential expansion of the resort prior to Christmas 2007; urges MSPs to allow the Scottish Government to release correspondence on this matter, and welcomes the decision of the Cairngorms National Park Authority to approve the development preserving 300 essential jobs in the community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1236</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Improving Services and Support for People with Dementia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the findings of the report, <em>Improving Services and Support for People with Dementia</em><U>,</U> by the House of Commons&rsquo; Committee of Public Accounts; accepts that while the report is focused on the provision of care services in England, many of its findings can be applied to Scotland; agrees with the report that early diagnosis is essential for planning the long-term care needs of dementia patients; expresses concern that only 31% of GPs consider themselves to have received basic training in the diagnosis and management of dementia; acknowledges that the number of dementia patients in Scotland is expected to rise to an estimated 108,000 by 2031; recognises that, in order to respond to this increase, substantial improvements must be made to meet the highest standards of community and health care; notes that the Scottish Government has made dementia a national priority; further notes that, unlike for cancer, there is no lead clinician with responsibility for dementia, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to create a dementia tsar with responsibility for improving dementia services in both the community and care homes and for creating a long-term dementia strategy to meet future challenges.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1235</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>The Draft Community Care (Personal Care and Nursing Care) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Health and Sport Committee recommends that the draft Community Care (Personal Care and Nursing Care) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2008 be approved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1234</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Young Traditional Musician of the Year 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ewan Robertson from Carrbridge on winning the BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician of the Year 2008 award, decided during the Celtic Connections festival at the City Halls, Glasgow on Sunday 27 January 2008, the first singer-guitarist to do so; commends all those who took part in what was a fantastic showpiece of young Scottish talent; recognises the quality of contestants fielded which made this year&rsquo;s decision one of the most difficult for a decade; acknowledges the contribution that institutions such as the National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music at Plockton High School and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama can make in the development of young musicians, both of which Ewan Robertson attended as a student, and wishes Ewan the greatest of success in his musical career.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1233</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Speedy Progress Required On Haudagain Roundabout in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the <em>Aberdeen Evening Express&rsquo; </em>campaign, &quot;Our Fight to Fix Jam&quot;, which aims to speed up action to tackle traffic congestion at the Haudagain roundabout; notes that the roundabout is among Scotland&rsquo;s worst congestion hotspots, costing businesses every year and causing considerable delays to commuters; notes that it has been estimated that the Haudagain could now be costing the north-east economy upwards of &pound;30 million a year in lost productivity, trade and extra fuel for the 20,000 vehicles that use it at peak times and can result in delays of up to 30 minutes; notes that consultation on making improvements to the roundabout has been delayed, and believes that consultation should be carried out and acted on expeditiously and should include the option of a flyover.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1232#</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>National Association of Youth Orchestras</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the objectives of the National Association of Youth Orchestras in supporting, encouraging and facilitating young musicians by giving them the opportunity to perform orchestral works at the highest level; recognises the association&rsquo;s vital contribution to the cultural life both of the capital city and all of Scotland, and would like to see it remain based in Edinburgh.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1231</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>Clydesdale Befrienders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Clydesdale Befriending Group on its success in securing &pound;244,928 from the Big Lottery Fund; recognises the group as a fantastic resource for adults with learning difficulties in the area by providing support and social outings that will help these adults become more confident individuals, obtain new skills and make lasting friendships, and commends the Big Lottery Fund for the millions of pounds distributed to similar groups and good causes throughout the country each year.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1230</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>The Draft Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1985 (Low Income, Low Asset Debtors etc.) Regulations 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that the draft Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1985 (Low Income, Low Asset Debtors etc.) Regulations 2008 be approved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1229</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Beating Bowel Cancer - 2008 BE LOUD! Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Beating Bowel Cancer&rsquo;s BE LOUD! campaign, formally the Loud Tie campaign, which aims to raise awareness of bowel cancer; notes that bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in Scotland, with around 1,600 people dying from the illness and over 3,500 new cases being diagnosed each year; recognises that early clinical detection and intervention can save lives; welcomes the continuation of the national screening programme, successfully piloted in Grampian, Tayside and Fife, which will see over 650,000 potentially vulnerable people being screened by 2009; urges people to take part in the national screening programme by returning their self-test kits; supports further improvements in bowel cancer services in Scotland which build on increased patient involvement and public awareness delivered through managed clinical networks, and encourages MSPs to support the BE LOUD! campaign between 28 January and 3 February 2008 on behalf of Beating Bowel Cancer.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1228</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>VAT on Sports and Leisure Trusts&rsquo; Membership Packages</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament disapproves of HM Revenue and Customs&rsquo; (HMRC) recent decision to charge VAT on sports and leisure trusts&rsquo; membership packages and to collect unpaid VAT retrospectively over the last three years; notes that PricewaterhouseCoopers and Tax Counsel advised the Sports and Recreation Trusts Association (SpoRTA) that the way in which HMRC is seeking to charge VAT is wrong in law; recognises the potentially serious financial and social consequences for leisure trusts and their customers including higher membership fees at leisure centres necessary to cover the VAT liability which would lead to lower participation, especially in more deprived communities; is concerned that HMRC&rsquo;s decision to charge VAT retrospectively to some trusts may result in their liquidation, and further notes that HMRC&rsquo;s decision contradicts the policies of both the Scottish and Westminster governments&rsquo; efforts to promote healthier lifestyles and the wider health benefits of sport and leisure as well as undermining the drive to tackle public health issues such as obesity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1227</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Sensory Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Sensory Centre on the launch of a pioneering British Sign Language (BSL) glossary of science terms used in the Scottish schools curriculum, encapsulating the essence and meaning of complex scientific concepts; commends the fact that the glossary was devised predominantly by a team of highly qualified scientists and science teachers who are themselves deaf, and welcomes this as the start of the process of ensuring that the Scottish Government invests in accessible education for all BSL users.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1225*#*</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Heart at Risk Screening for Young Sportsmen and Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that cardiomyopathy, a thickening of the heart muscles, grows undetected at the body&rsquo;s fastest growing time, the teenage years; further notes that apparently healthy teenagers can suffer from this condition and that the condition kills a large number of teenagers annually; commends the work of Scottish HART (Heart at Risk Testing), a Borders-based national charity which researches into all heart diseases, especially cardiomyopathy, raises funds for a mobile screening unit which, with trained staff, will test the health of all young Scottish athletes, campaigns for defibrillators, researches all forms of heart disease, raises funds for mobile screening of young people and families at risk and has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to put monitoring equipment into sports centres, swimming pools and youth facilities across Scotland, and considers that the advantages and practicalities of providing screening for young people who, because of family history or the nature of their activities such as strenuous competitive sport, may be at risk of an early, sudden and preventable death, should be investigated through a pilot scheme, possibly in the Scottish Borders.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
