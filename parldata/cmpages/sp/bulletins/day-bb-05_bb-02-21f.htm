         <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2444#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Protect Public Sector Pensions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Westminster Government proposes to compulsorily raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 for all public sector workers; notes that this will result in a reduced pension for workers retiring before the age of 65; further notes that this has occurred at the same time as MPs and MSPs have enhanced their own pension rights out of the public purse; considers strongly that the Westminster Government should not take this action which will reduce the living standards of working people in their retirement, and expresses its full support for the public sector trade unions in their campaign to defend jobs, conditions and services.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2443#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Tribute to Helen MacFarlane</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the forthcoming launch of the book, <em>Helen MacFarlane: A Feminist, Revolutionary Journalist and Philosopher in mid-nineteenth century England</em>; welcomes the fact that this radical Scotswoman will at last be rescued from obscurity and given her place of importance in 19th century politics and political movements, including the Chartists and the Vienna uprising of 1848; further notes that it was Helen MacFarlane, under the alias Howard Morton, who first translated the seminal pamphlet, <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>, into English for the magazine, <em>The Red Republican</em>, and that she played an active role in promoting the politics of revolution and equality throughout her life, and believes that the Scottish Parliament Information Centre should order several copies of her book and that libraries across Scotland should be encouraged to do likewise.</p>

I am afraid it is do with the fact that Scotland is not a very attractive place for people to come and settle. That is due to the fact that you have a bloated public sector and Scotland generally has suffered economically as a result. That is not going to change and even if we were to allow unlimited immigration, immigrants will still be going to settle in the south-east of England until Scotland gets its economic act together&quot;; further welcomes his comments in <em>The Scotsman</em> on Thursday 10 February 2005 that &quot;The fact that Scotland can offer a high quality of life makes it all the more frustrating that it should suffer population loss&quot;; understands that his comments on &quot;Good Morning Scotland&quot; were specifically referring to the state of the Scottish economy and condemns Labour and SNP politicians for deliberately quoting these comments out of context; notes that estimates of migration to UK regions in 2001 show that a mere 4% of immigrants chose to settle in Scotland, compared with 41.5% in London; further notes that, according to the Registrar General, Scotland experiences a net loss of people aged 16 to 34 to the rest of the United Kingdom, and concludes that, in light of the fact that Scotland was ranked 10 places behind the United Kingdom in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for the &quot;extent to which government policies are conducive to competitiveness&quot;, the economic policies pursued by the Scottish Executive are responsible for Scotland&rsquo;s low levels of immigration.&quot;</p>
