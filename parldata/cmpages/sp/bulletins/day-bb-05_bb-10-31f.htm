<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only  printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the  complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is  published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains any motions lodged  for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for  debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol  (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in  the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party  support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a  declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3487 Murdo Fraser: Autism-Specific  Medical Treatment Centre&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the charity,  Action Against Autism, for bringing to Scotland, at the Royal College of  Physicians, six of the world&rsquo;s leading medical doctors practising in the field  of autism, who articulated to delegates from over 10 countries that autism can  be treated by the introduction of safe and proven interventions for the often  painful and distressing underlying medical conditions which courageous children  with autism are experiencing, and believes that the Scottish Executive should  give consideration to the establishment of an Autism-Specific Medical Treatment  Centre in Scotland to address the needs of the 3,400 primary school children  and others who have been identified as suffering from this devastating  condition. <strong>R</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3486 Mr Tom McCabe: Scottish  Schools (Parental Involvement) Bill: Financial Resolution&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting  from the Scottish Schools (Parental Involvement) Bill, agrees to any  expenditure or increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in Rule  9.12.3(b)(iii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of  the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3485 Mr Brian Monteith: Increase  in Whisky Exports&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that the Scotch Whisky  Association (SWA) reports that over &pound;1,000 million worth of Scotch whisky was  shipped overseas in the first six months of 2005, the first time that the  billion pound barrier has been broken since 1997; further notes that exports to  the important Chinese market are up 124% to a total value of &pound;22 million and  that Scotch and green tea, a popular way of drinking Scotch whisky in China, is  proving a successful combination, while demand in other key Asian markets is  strong; welcomes reports that growth is also good in emerging markets such as  India, where exports are up 19% to &pound;7 million, and Russia, where exports are up  80% to &pound;12 million, with the value of exports to South America &nbsp;up 19% to  &pound;106 million, and believes that the Parliament should set an example of  encouraging the use of Scotland&rsquo;s national drink by asking Parliamentary  reception and event organisers if they wish to offer Scotch whisky to MSPs and  guests as well as wine and soft drinks.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3484 Phil Gallie: Recognition  and Action on Gulf War Syndrome&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament requests the Scottish  Executive to express the view to the Prime Minister that for far too long the  Ministry of Defence (MoD) has turned its back on the veterans of the 1990-91  Gulf War campaign by ignoring the high incidence of so-called Gulf War syndrome,  despite the findings of Lord Lloyd&rsquo;s public inquiry, the recognition given to  the illness by our US allies, the support of former chiefs of staff and the  magnitude of evidence which shows many Scottish veterans and their families to  be victims, and demands that the MoD takes action now to alleviate the plight  of those victims and to bring a degree of closure to those who have suffered so  much.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3481 Rosie Kane: They Hang Asylum Seekers in the Scottish Parliament&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament finds it ironic that photographs which adorn its walls include Nexhi  Vucaj and that Nexhi, her husband and three children were subjected to a dawn  raid at the hands of the Home Office and were removed to Albania, having lived  in Glasgow for five years; welcomes the image of asylum seekers among our works  of art; believes that, if we are to exhibit these images in the Parliament to  emphasise our diversity here in Scotland, then at the very least we should do  everything we can to ensure that people who come to this country for whatever  reason are welcomed, supported and encouraged to stay, and further believes  that the rich tapestry which makes up Scotland is something we should cherish,  but not only on a wall and in a frame.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3469 Mr Mark Ruskell: GM-Free Areas&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the recent ruling of the  European Court of Justice against Upper Austria&rsquo;s law outlawing the cultivation  of GM crops; acknowledges the singular lack of demand for GM produce within the  European Union; believes that European regions must have the right to determine  whether or not they allow GM crops to be grown; congratulates Scottish local  authorities that have declared a GM ban, and calls on the Scottish Executive to  declare Scotland a GM-free area forthwith.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3467 Mr Mark Ruskell: GM Contamination and the Impossibility of Coexistence&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament notes with concern the publication of <em>Persistence of seeds from  crops of conventional and herbicide tolerant oilseed rape,</em> a  DEFRA-commissioned report showing that enough GM contamination to breach the EU  reporting threshold can remain viable for up to 15 years after the harvest of  the initial GM crop; believes that such research demonstrates that coexistence  between GM and conventional crops is unlikely to be possible but is likely to  result in widespread contamination of Scottish crops, and acknowledges the need  for a comprehensive GM-liability regime to protect the economic interests of  farmers wishing to remain GM-free.</p>
