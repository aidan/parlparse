<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1267</strong> <strong>Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Caithness and Sutherland Welcome Lottery Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the announcement by the Big Lottery Fund on 30 January 2008 of awards of &pound;784,997 to the Assynt Foundation to turn Glencanisp Lodge into self-catering visitor accommodation, &pound;227,666 to the Culag Community Woodland Trust Ltd which will extend an all-ability path already in place and will give greater access for all to the site of special scientific interest at Loch Beannach and &pound;200,000 to the Pulteneytown People&rsquo;s Project which will enable the commencement of the establishment of a community regeneration centre in Pulteneytown in Caithness.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1266</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Responsible Procurement Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the launch of its responsible procurement strategy; notes that, rather than just being a collection of worthy policies, this is a systematic approach to responsible procurement which aims to transform culture across the Parliament; further commends the publication of the strategy to meet the Parliament&rsquo;s needs without jeopardising the ability of others to meet their needs in the future; acknowledges that this is a contribution to the high standard of environmental management already adopted in the Parliament, which was the first public body to adopt ecological footprint as a corporate key performance indicator, and notes that, by seeking the highest standards in its operations, we can demonstrate that we should all aspire to be responsible global citizens.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1265</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Sub-standard Military Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the sub-standard nature of military accommodation in Scotland; notes that some 50% of barracks fall into this category as defined by the UK Government; further notes as one example that 60% of units are sub-standard at the Scottish base of 45 Commando Royal Marines, who have served with distinction in conflicts from the Falklands to Iraq and Afghanistan; believes that service personnel deserve adequate accommodation; considers the UK Government&rsquo;s scheduling of improvements over 20 years to be shameful, and calls for the improvement of these facilities to take place much more quickly so that no service personnel or their families are forced to live in housing that is substandard or inadequate.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1264</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Scottish Book Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Book Trust on the launch of its new programme of activities; recognises the importance of the work that the Scottish Book Trust carries out in encouraging both readers and writers in Scotland; commends the trust for its work in schools, prisons and also with looked-after children which helps to improve communication skills and encourages reading and literature; further congratulates the trust on its work to promote Scottish writers and writing through projects such as the New Writers awards and the Short Story campaign; commends in particular the Isle of Jura Writer Retreat programme which has established itself as one of the best creative opportunities available to writers of stature anywhere in the world; notes the new projects being introduced this year which include a new children&rsquo;s festival, as well as a new Scotland-wide project to encourage Scots to share their stories, and wishes the Scottish Book Trust every success for these events and beyond.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1263</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Proposed Closure of Morton and St Fergus Nurseries in Renfrewshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Liberal Democrat/SNP-led Renfrewshire Council to close the HMIE-commended Morton Nursery in Linwood and St Fergus Nursery in Ferguslie; notes that these decisions fly in the face of overwhelming opposition of staff, parents and the local community as a whole in each case, and urges the council to reconsider these ill-thought-out plans thus ensuring that the people of Linwood and Ferguslie can continue to benefit from the excellent standard of education, care and supervision that each nursery delivers for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1262</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Voytek the Bear</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the campaign to give proper recognition to Voytek the &quot;Soldier Bear&quot;, who served in the Polish army during the Second World War and was billeted near Hutton in Berwickshire before retiring to Edinburgh Zoo; recognises the affection with which he was held by his comrades, and urges MSPs to support efforts to secure a permanent memorial to an unlikely war hero.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1261</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Ronald Rae&rsquo;s Lion of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the popular success of the exhibition of Ronald Rae&rsquo;s sculptures in Holyrood Park; notes that most of the exhibits will be removed in March to locations such as Iona and the Falkirk Wheel; further notes that Ronald Rae is prepared to leave the Lion of Scotland in the vicinity of the Parliament with no funding cost to the Parliament, including liability cover; further notes that the Arts Advisory Committee of this Parliament will meet in February to consider inter alia what exhibits to accept, and therefore urges MSPs to support the location of the lion outside the Parliament where it has already made its natural home.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1260.1</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Poverty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1260) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;recognises that the Scottish Government, UK Government and local governments need to work together to get people off welfare and into work where possible and to increase the percentage of benefit take-up ensuring that those most in need of help get it, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward proposals to achieve these aims.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1260.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Poverty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1260) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;that tackling these challenges&quot; to end and insert &quot;; regrets that the SNP&rsquo;s approach fails to respond to the needs of the poorest households in Scotland and fails to engage those groups experienced in tackling poverty in finding solutions, and believes that social justice is a priority for the Scottish people and should remain a central policy commitment of the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1260.3</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Poverty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1260) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;that tackling these challenges&quot; to end and insert &quot;; believes that tackling poverty requires a co-ordinated approach with the UK Government to ensure that the benefits system supports those most in need and actively encourages those able to return to education, training and work to do so; believes that a cross-party approach to increasing opportunity across Scotland is required, and therefore calls for the establishment of a cross-party inquiry, involving stakeholders, to address the causes and effects of poverty and wealth inequality in Scotland and recommend to the Parliament practical actions in areas including health, housing, training, social enterprise and the voluntary sector, micro-credit and community regeneration.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1258.1</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1258) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;; notes the SNP&rsquo;s commitment&quot; to end and insert &quot;and the need for energy efficiency, quality design including the incorporation of sound ecological and sustainable design principles, and value for money for the public purse in building schools; recognises the need for the Scottish Government and local authorities to continue to improve Scotland&rsquo;s school estate; notes the SNP&rsquo;s commitment to match the previous administration&rsquo;s proposed school building programme &quot;brick for brick&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a statement to the Parliament detailing its plans for new schools and how these will be funded.&quot;</p>

<p>Supported by: Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1258.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1258) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;recognises the publication of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on the Scottish Futures Trust and its support for the use of private finance, and is concerned that the failure of the SNP government to bring forward an alternative funding mechanism and support is causing confusion and uncertainty and is holding back councils across Scotland who want to improve schools in their areas.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1246.1</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Accessible Passenger Transport and the National Concessionary Fares Scheme</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1246) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &quot;expresses concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that it is vital that accessible and affordable public transport is available to help the Scottish Government to meet its climate change objectives and to ensure the continuation of vital urban and rural services; calls on the Scottish Government to provide a substantial increase in the budget for the Bus Service Operators Grant in 2008-09 and to consider keeping fares more affordable for the longer term; notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s intention to review the national concessionary travel scheme, and calls on ministers during that review to ensure that they maximise the benefits for the public throughout Scotland while guaranteeing the best return on a scheme which represents a significant investment of public money.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1246.1.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Accessible Passenger Transport and the National Concessionary Fares Scheme</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-1246.1) in the name of Patrick Harvie, insert at end &quot;and notes that Labour and Liberal Democrat ministers in the previous administration chose not to grant eligibility to disabled people in receipt of the lower rate of disability allowance and to older and disabled people using community transport in rural areas when they created the National Concessionary Fares Scheme.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1246.2</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Accessible Passenger Transport and the National Concessionary Fares Scheme</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1246) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;recognises the valuable contribution that Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) can make to social inclusion and accessibility, particularly in rural areas and for disabled and elderly passengers; notes with concern that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget has caused uncertainty over the future of DRT provision; considers that expansion of DRT is an essential aspect of improving accessibility in Scotland, and therefore calls on ministers to end the uncertainty and develop DRT services in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1231</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>Clydesdale Befrienders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Clydesdale Befriending Group on its success in securing &pound;244,928 from the Big Lottery Fund; recognises the group as a fantastic resource for adults with learning difficulties in the area by providing support and social outings that will help these adults become more confident individuals, obtain new skills and make lasting friendships, and commends the Big Lottery Fund for the millions of pounds distributed to similar groups and good causes throughout the country each year.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1213*#*</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Marketing and Communications Sector in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the marketing and communications sector in Scotland is worth &pound;350 million a year and employs around 40,000 people, making the industry an important service sector for Scotland, including in rural areas such as Dumfries and Galloway; welcomes the presence of the Scottish Marketing Communications Action Group in the Parliament on 19 February 2008; notes that the group is requesting the Scottish Government to enter into a partnership to work with the industry to build on its strengths and agrees that work should continue between the government and the industry to increase the income retained by businesses in Scotland and to increase the skills within the sector, generating a potential increase in income of over &pound;100 million; furthermore recognises that marketing and communications, as part of Scotland&rsquo;s service sector, is an essential element in driving Scotland&rsquo;s business growth and attractiveness to inward investors, and therefore pledges to do what it can to assist in this initiative.</p>
