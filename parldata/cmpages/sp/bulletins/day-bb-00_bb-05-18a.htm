            Care</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the Executive&#146;s approach 
            to community care, which aims to put the people using services and 
            their carers at the centre, building on Modernising Community Care: 
            an Action Plan; welcomes progress on the Strategy for Carers in Scotland, 
            published in November; welcomes the work of the National Care Standards 
            Committee to ensure the quality of care provision through national 
            standards; welcomes the consultation on proposals for the independent 
            regulation of care services and staff; welcomes the setting up of 
            the Joint Future Group in December; welcomes the publication of the 
            Learning Disability Review report The same as you? on 11 May 2000, 
            and calls upon the NHS, local authorities and the voluntary and private 
            sectors to make joint working a reality in every aspect of community 
            care, in a Scotland where everyone matters. </p>

            Gray, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports 
            the concept of care in the community; recognises the excellent work 
            done in the Sutherland Report on long term care With Respect to Old 
            Age; condemns the continued failure of the Executive to implement 
            fully the recommendations of that Royal Commission; demands adequate 
            funding for those providing services within local government and the 
            voluntary sector; urges the Executive to accept responsibility for 
            community care, and invites it to provide real leadership, and the 
            necessary funding, to enable successful joint working in this field.&quot;

            Care</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-868) in the name of Iain 
            Gray, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes 
            that the Scottish Executive&#146;s approach to community care has 
            resulted in a 40% increase in blocked beds in acute hospitals since 
            1997, to a total of 2,400 in the latest delayed discharge census, 
            and that this costs the NHS in Scotland up to £96 million per year 
            compared with the cost of nursing home places; further notes that 
            many local authorities across Scotland have been forced to reduce 
            services and increase costs for community care clients as a direct 
            result of the Executive&#146;s latest local government financial settlement; 
            further notes that many nursing and residential homes are facing severe 
            financial pressure, due to decisions by councils to freeze fees for 
            social work funded places despite cost increases; calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to unify health and social work budgets within Community 
            Health Trusts involving NHS community services, social work services, 
            the voluntary sector and the private sector; and believes that NHS 
            resources wasted on blocked beds should be transferred to Health Trusts 
            in order to provide more community care places and to deliver seamless 
            and more effective community care services for clients. &quot;<strong>

            Out in Scottish Prisons</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that urgent 
            action must be taken in the 21st century to end &quot;slopping out&quot; 
            at affected Scottish prisons, particularly Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow 
            which is 90% without basic sanitation; acknowledges that Barlinnie 
            cannot start its third century with this stomach churning and degrading 
            practice continuing and that the practice of emptying chamber pots 
            around five times a day is not only inhumane for prisoners but for 
            also for staff who supervise and who deplore the practice; notes that 
            Barlinnie&#146;s high international status as an innovative prison 
            and its excellent rehabilitation work is impaired seriously by the 
            time consumed by slopping out, with around 400 staff hours a day wasted 
            away from essential rehabilitation work with prisoners due to the 
            security need to be on duty at sluice rooms, and urges that the money 
            removed from the Scottish Prison Service budget for the Drugs Enforcement 
            Agency must not result in any delay to plans to end slopping out as 
            feared by prison officers.<i><strong> </strong></i>
