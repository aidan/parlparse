              <p><strong>S2M-291</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Auxiliary 
                Fire Units in the Highlands</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
                notes that auxiliary fire units play a vital role in many rural 
                communities in fighting fires and do so in conjunction with the 
                retained fire brigades; notes with concern that, following a report 
                from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Fire Services (HMI), 32 auxiliary 
                units face possible closure; further notes that the new approach 
                of integrated risk assessment should permit the preservation of 
                as many as possible of these auxiliary units; considers that the 
                Scottish Executive should explicitly endorse the need for such 
                units and acknowledge the essential role that they play in protecting 
                human life and property; believes that, if the recommendations 
                of the HMI report are not carefully considered and auxiliary units 
                are forced to close because of the proposed introduction of compulsory 
                access to breathing apparatus within a short timescale, then human 
                life and property may be placed at risk; believes that all involved, 
                including Highland Council, the Firemaster, HMI and the Health 
                and Safety Executive, should continue to discuss the implications 
                of the HMI report in the context of integrated risk assessment 
                and find an outcome that prevents the closure of so many of the 
                auxiliary units.</p>
