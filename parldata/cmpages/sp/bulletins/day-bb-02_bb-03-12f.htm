          <p><strong>*S1M-2877#</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Hamish Henderson</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recalls the unique and vigorous contribution made by 
            Hamish Henderson to Scotland and its culture; notes that he was a 
            strong supporter of a Scottish Parliament but an even stronger supporter 
            of opening up the minds and hearts of the peoples of Scotland to social 
            justice and song; pays tribute to his work to record and maintain 
            the languages, stories and passions of ordinary Scots folk and to 
            carry such traditions forward, and determines to find an appropriate 
            way to honour him and the many national and international causes he 
            espoused in the new Parliament building at Holyrood.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2876</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: Third Party 
            Insurance for GM Crops</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes press 
            reports that insurance companies are unwilling to provide third party 
            cover against accidental contamination by GM crops; further notes 
            with concern how vulnerable this may leave organic farms in the vicinity 
            of GM crop field trials, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make 
            representations to the European Commission that a temporary moratorium 
            on GM crop field trials should be imposed until a statutory third 
            party insurance scheme is introduced that will protect the interests 
            of other third parties.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2875</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: Food Protection 
            (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) 
            (No.3) (Scotland) Order 2002</strong>&#151;That the Health and Community 
            Care Committee in consideration of the Food Protection (Emergency 
            Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.3) (Scotland) 
            Order 2002 (SSI 2002/80) recommends that the order be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong>, Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2874#</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon: Drugs and Driving</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText" id="MotionText">expresses concern 
            about the number of lives lost in road traffic crashes that may have 
            been caused by people driving whilst under the influence of legal 
            and illegal drugs; recognises that, in law, driving while unfit through 
            drugs is an offence; notes that Transport Research Laboratory tests 
            demonstrated a significant increase between the 1980s and 1990s in 
            the percentage of people testing positive for illegal drugs who have 
            been involved in fatal collisions; welcomes the launch by the British 
            Medical Association of its web resource on research that has been 
            undertaken and is currently in progress; considers that there should 
            be speedier and more specific and co-ordinated research in order that 
            appropriate and conclusive drug testing devices can be introduced, 
            and believes that there should be a Scottish campaign in order to 
            educate the public that the side effects of illegal and certain prescribed 
            drugs can affect their ability to drive. </a></p>
