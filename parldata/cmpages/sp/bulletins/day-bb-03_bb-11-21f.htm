          <p><strong>*S2M-642#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Social 
            Work Review</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the shortage of social workers throughout Scotland and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should initiate a McCrone-type review to look 
            at social workers&#8217; pay and conditions in order to attract and 
            retain more social workers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-641</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Female 
            Genital Mutilation and Asylum Seekers</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            notes the plight of the asylum seeker named as &quot;Margaret&quot; 
            featured on &quot;Newsnight Scotland&quot; on 19 November 2003; notes 
            the continuation of the brutal practice of female genital mutilation 
            in Margaret&#8217;s homeland of Sierra Leone and the extreme danger 
            that Margaret&#8217;s daughters would face if they were to be returned 
            there; resolves to oppose by all necessary means the deportation of 
            women and children to countries where female genital mutilation is 
            practised; calls upon the Home Office to end the asylum lottery in 
            which legitimate refugees are refused asylum because of poor legal 
            representation and erratic asylum adjudicators, and resolves to oppose 
            any attempt to detain or deport Margaret and her children when they 
            attend the Glasgow office of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate 
            on 29 November 2003.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-640</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Boycott</strong>&#8212;That 
            the Parliament considers that the boycott by the Scottish Executive 
            of the debate on Thursday 20 November 2003 on the subject of world 
            peace demonstrated a considered contempt for the Parliament and democratic 
            debate, particularly given the history of Labour in supporting the 
            war in Iraq without a UN mandate specifically authorising such action, 
            and therefore calls on the First Minister to apologise to the Chamber 
            for this behaviour.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-639#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Widows and Lloyds TSB</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament deplores 
            the decision to transfer Scottish Widows jobs out of Scotland and 
            believes that none of Lloyds TSB&#8217;s operations in Scotland should 
            be threatened with either closure or downsizing as a consequence of 
            work being transferred abroad.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-638#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Road 
            Safety</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes the success of the 
            Lothian and Borders Safety Camera Partnership in addressing the problems 
            of speeding and serious road crashes and commends the pilot of 20 
            mph zones utilising flashing road signs outside seven Edinburgh primary 
            schools in making roads safer for children.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-637#</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Ministerial 
            Boycott of World Peace Debate</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament deplores 
            the decision by the Scottish Executive to boycott the debate on world 
            peace and considers that Executive ministers should take part in every 
            Parliamentary debate.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-636#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Pensions</strong>&#8212;That 
            the Parliament considers that Her Majesty&#8217;s Government should 
            re-establish the link between retirement pensions and the annual increase 
            in wages.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-635#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Transfer 
            of Reserved Powers</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament believes that 
            it should petition Her Majesty&#8217;s Government to introduce the 
            requisite Orders in Council to transfer all reserved powers detailed 
            in Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998 to the Scottish Parliament 
            with immediate effect.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-634#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Breeding 
            of Animals</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament expresses concern at 
            the inadequacy of current legislation in respect of the breeding of 
            animals, in particular domestic pets, and believes that urgent action 
            should be taken to deal with this situation.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-633#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Non-numeric 
            Fingerprinting</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament expresses concern 
            at the introduction of non-numeric fingerprinting evidence by the 
            Scottish Criminal Record Office, its implications for the success 
            rate of convictions and the potential consequential increase in the 
            legal aid budget and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            review this policy on a cross-departmental basis prior to its implementation.</p>
