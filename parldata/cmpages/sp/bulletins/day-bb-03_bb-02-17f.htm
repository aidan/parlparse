by: Des McNulty<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3906</STRONG> <STRONG>Dorothy-Grace 
Elder: End Pro-War Spin</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament believes that the first 
casualty of war is truth; is deeply concerned about any "pro-war" spin which alarms 
the public and is without any proof; further believes that the untrue propaganda 
that New Year celebrations in Scotland could be hit by terrorist activities, that 
the London underground would be targeted and the hype over a threat to Heathrow 
and other airports have been against public interest and safety; is further concerned 
that such careless hype could in itself put the public in danger from disturbed 
individuals latching on to a situation; calls upon Her Majesty's Government to 
act responsibly and prevent politically motivated spin, and reminds it that anti-terrorist 
moves require to be mainly covert, that investment in proper surveillance is needed 
and that careless words are dangerous.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3905</STRONG> <STRONG>Ross

</P><P>Supported by: Hugh Henry</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3901</STRONG> <STRONG>Donald 
Gorrie: The Future of Football in Scotland</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament urges 
the Scottish football authorities to appoint a group of people of high standing 
in Scotland with a genuine commitment to Scottish football that would promote 
and co-ordinate football coaching, competition and development at all levels, 
including schools, youth organisations, juvenile and youth football teams and 
adult amateur teams, in co-operation with existing organisations, and encourage 
and help professional clubs to develop youth training schemes.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3900</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Cathie Craigie: St Valentine's Day - Women and Heart Disease Campaign</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the British Heart Foundation's Valentine's Day campaign 
Take Note of Your Heart which aims to raise awareness among women about the risks 
of coronary heart disease (CHD); notes that more women die from CHD each year 
in Scotland than from all forms of cancer put together, including breast cancer; 
acknowledges that, despite this high rate, CHD is still widely considered to be 
a male disease; welcomes the approach taken by the Scottish Executive to reduce 
Scotland's high rate of heart disease through encouraging positive lifestyle choices, 
particularly as outlined in <EM>Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke: Strategy for 
Scotland</EM> and the healthyliving campaign, and encourages the Executive to 
work with the British Heart Foundation to promote awareness and prevention of 
CHD amongst women.</P><P>Supported by: Mr John McAllion, David Mundell, Rhoda

Nora Radcliffe<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3899</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy 
Sheridan: Closure of Glasgow City Social Security Office</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament recognises that those who rely on social security benefits are the 
most vulnerable in society and include elderly, disabled and infirm people and 
that these sections of the community often have difficulties with mobility and 
access to modern communications such as telephones and the internet; believes 
that social security is best delivered in properly staffed, local offices that 
are accessible to the community; is therefore dismayed at the plans of the Department 
for Work and Pensions for social security provision in Scotland including the 
closure of the Glasgow city office in 2003, which will mean a reduction in service 
and increased travel for the people in areas such as Glasgow city centre, Townhead, 
Possilpark, Hamiltonhill and Charing Cross who are seeking social security benefits 
advice and services, and the replacement of local overpayments sections with debt 
centres; is concerned at the absence of proper public debate and consultation 
on the closure of the Glasgow city office, and calls on the Department for Work 
and Pensions to keep the office open in its current form as a local social security 
office.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3898#</STRONG> <STRONG>Dr Richard Simpson: New Forth 
Road Bridge Crossing Near Kincardine</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with the new Forth road bridge 
crossing upstream from the Kincardine Bridge; welcomes the decision by the Forth 
Valley NHS Board to recommend to the Executive that there should be a new single 
site acute hospital and notes the board&#146;s unanimous recommendation that the 
favoured site for the hospital should be at the Royal Scottish National Hospital 
(RSNH), Larbert; recognises the difficulties at present in access to the RSNH 
for residents in Clackmannanshire, west Fife and Stirling, and considers that 
the Executive should do all in its power to ensure that the bridge is completed 
as soon as possible and that, in considering the proposed site for the new hospital, 
the road networks should provide equity of access to all residents in Forth Valley.</P><P>Supported

<STRONG>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Suicide Emergency Telephone Hotline</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with concern that in 2000 there were 880 reported suicides 
in Scotland, 676 males and 204 females, although the true figure could be higher; 
is conscious that many thousands of other people attempt to take their own lives 
each year; regrets that only a minority of the population know the telephone number 
of the Samaritans or any other organisation they could contact for help when feeling 
suicidal; believes that, to assist in achieving the goal of a 20% reduction in 
the incidence of suicide by 2013 set by the Scottish Executive in its <EM>National 
Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide in Scotland</EM>, everyone should 
be made aware of an all-Scotland telephone number to call for help; acknowledges 
that in the United States anyone can call a nationwide toll free number from anywhere 
in the country, 1-800-SUICIDE or 911, to ask for help which is provided swiftly 
if they say they are in &#145;suicidal danger&#146;; believes that the Scottish 
Executive should set up a suicide prevention crisis hotline, whereby calls from 
suicidal individuals are treated as an emergency, through using the existing 999 
emergency number from which they can be referred directly to a dedicated suicide 
prevention 24 hour hotline, and further acknowledges that the purpose of this 
line would be to save lives through dissuading suicidal people from killing themselves 
and that the Executive should, once such a line was established, take steps to 
let the public know about it.</P><P>Supported by: Colin Campbell, Linda Fabiani</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3896</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Pauline McNeill: Celtic Connections 10th Anniversary</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the Celtic Connections traditional 
music festival on achieving ten years of celebrating Celtic music and notes that 
this annual festival, that takes place in January each year, is now firmly established 
as Scotland's largest Celtic music event.</P><P>Supported by: Brian Fitzpatrick, 
Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3895</STRONG> <STRONG>Ross Finnie: The Nitrate 
Vulnerable Zones (Grants) (Scotland) Scheme 2003 (SSI 2003/52)</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Transport and the Environment Committee, in consideration of the Nitrate Vulnerable 
Zones (Grants) (Scotland) Scheme 2003, recommends that the instrument be approved.</P><P>Supported 
by: Allan Wilson</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3885</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Jamie McGrigor: Fishing 
Industry Crisis</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the severity of the 
crisis facing the Scottish fishing industry; believes that the effects of the 
conservation measures already taken by Scottish fishermen have not been taken 
into full consideration; notes the Scottish Executive&#146;s £50 million aid package 
but questions the balance of the allocation between decommissioning and transitional 
funding, and further notes that the Common Fisheries Policy of collective management 
has been disastrous for the Scottish fishing industry and must be replaced, and 
that only a move to national and local control will bring sustainability to the 
Scottish fishing industry in the future.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3884</STRONG> <STRONG>Richard 
Lochhead: Recovery Package for the Fishing Industry</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
rejects the decommissioning proposals contained in the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
fisheries package; calls on ministers to consult with the fishing industry with 
a view to delivering a recovery package that includes transitional support measures 
for the catching and onshore sectors that will keep the industry intact; believes 
that European and HM Treasury support should be provided to fund these measures, 
and further calls on the Scottish Executive to urgently renegotiate the fisheries 
deal agreed by Her Majesty&#146;s Government in December in order to secure a 
fair level of fishing opportunities for the Scottish fleet.</P><P>Supported by:

Catholic Education Week - 16 to 23 February 2003</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
acknowledges family life as an important initiation into living in society; further 
acknowledges that parents are the principal and first educators of their children; 
recognises the key role of all educators in giving our young people instruction 
and formation that is respectful of shared truths, the qualities of the heart 
and the moral and spiritual dignity of humankind; welcomes the important past, 
present and future contributions of Catholic schools to the better education and 
national life of Scotland; notes the success of many denominational schools in 
fostering school ethos and, in particular, in improving the academic achievements 
of disadvantaged youngsters; affirms and supports the right of all parents to 
choose Catholic schools for their children, and extends its best wishes to all 
involved in preparations for events taking place for Catholic Education Sunday 
and Week from 16 to 23 February 2003 and the establishment of the new Catholic 
Education Service.</P><P>Supported by: Paul Martin, Cathie Craigie, Angus MacKay,

Kate Maclean, Pauline McNeill, Cathy Peattie<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3882</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Nicola Sturgeon: Pharmacy Services in Scotland</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament recognises the invaluable contribution provided by community pharmacies 
to the NHS in Scotland; further recognises that the present control of entry system 
for pharmacies wishing to dispense NHS prescriptions currently suits the needs 
of Scottish patients; notes with concern the findings of the Office of Fair Trading 
in its report <EM>The control of entry regulations and retail pharmacy services 
in the UK</EM>; further notes that acceptance of the Office of Fair Trading&#146;s 
recommendations may threaten the livelihood of community pharmacists across Scotland, 
and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to reject any action to alter the 
statutory arrangements for controlling entry to NHS pharmaceutical lists.</P><P>Supported

Brown: Pharmacy Services in Scotland</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3882) 
in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert after second &quot;Scotland&quot;, &quot;at 
a time when there is also the threat to the future of local sub-post offices and 
the viability of many suburban and rural shopping centres,&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3881</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Alasdair Morgan: Relocation of Forest Enterprise Headquarters</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament believes that there is a strong case for relocating public service 
jobs from Edinburgh to rural parts of Scotland; notes that Dumfries is being considered 
as one of four options for the location of the headquarters of Forest Enterprise; 
acknowledges that Dumfries already has the south of Scotland office for the agency 
and is located in close proximity to many of Scotland's major forests and forest 
industries, and asks the Scottish Executive to examine closely the serious case 
that can be made for relocating Forest Enterprise's headquarters to south west 
Scotland.</P><P>Supported by: Alex Neil, Kay Ullrich, Michael Matheson, David 
Mundell, Alex Fergusson</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3876# Funding for Local Roads</STRONG> 
(lodged on 7 February 2003) Cathy Peattie<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3876.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Funding for Local Roads</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment 
to motion (S1M-3876) in the name of Dr Sylvia Jackson, leave out from &quot;for 
a number of decades&quot; and insert &quot;this sum, though welcome, is but a 
fraction of the amount needed to address the problem; notes that capital spending 
on the construction and improvement of local roads across Scotland during the 
four years up to 1997 was £562 million, compared with £326 million in the four 
years after 1997; further welcomes the report of Stirling Council&#146;s cross-party 
scrutiny group and its call for the Scottish Executive to reduce its ring-fencing 
of funding allocated to local authorities; further notes that the scrutiny group 
highlighted the policy decision of Stirling Council&#146;s current Labour/SNP 
administration to reduce the share of roads grant-aided expenditure (GAE) allocated 
to roads, so that in 2001-02 only 65% of it was allocated to roads maintenance, 
compared with 126% in Perth and Kinross Council and a Scottish average of 103%; 
notes that, had Stirling Council&#146;s expenditure on roads maintenance been 
at 100% of roads GAE over the last six years, a further £9.8 million would have 
been spent on local roads in the district; understands that the SCOTS roads condition 
survey report, part-funded by the Scottish Executive, is now complete and believes 
that it should be published, and recognises that solving the problems affecting 
Stirling&#146;s roads requires a change of policy, from both the Scottish Executive 
and Stirling Council."</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3874# The Scottish Fire Service</STRONG>

<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Location of a New Hospital for Forth Valley</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the announcement by the Forth Valley NHS Board that its favoured 
location for a new single-site hospital for Forth Valley is the Royal Scottish 
National hospital site at Larbert; further notes that the board is to undertake 
further work including a feasibility study and transport impact assessment before 
submitting its outline business case to the Scottish Executive this summer; recognises 
that the Scottish Executive and the Minister for Health and Community Care retain 
the ultimate say over the location of the proposed new hospital for the area, 
and believes that the Executive should consider any case for a new hospital in 
the context of the accessibility of the hospital to the public and the consequential 
arrangements for community health care throughout the Forth Valley NHS Board area.</P><P>Supported

Andrew Welsh: Arbroath CAFE Project</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament applauds 
the pioneering work of the Arbroath CAFE Project which provides an invaluable 
service for young people in the area; notes that a safe, community alcohol-free 
environment was established where young people could socialise and engage in a 
wide range of activities, providing a positive alternative to &quot;life on the 
street&quot;; recognises the success of the project which has received national 
and international recognition and is being used as a model for projects elsewhere 
in the country and further afield; congratulates the project on being chosen as 
the launch pad in Scotland of the British Council&#146;s global Dreams and Teams 
project and on its plans to launch a pilot scheme, &quot;Street Football for All 
&quot; to take place throughout Angus with a view to becoming a national project, 
and wishes the CAFE Project every success with both these initiatives and in continuing 
to provide opportunities for young people and the wider community. </P><P>Supported
