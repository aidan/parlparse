          <p><strong>*S1M-2450</strong> <strong> Hugh Henry: World AIDS Day: 
            1 December 2001</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes World AIDS Day 
            on 1 December 2001 and the &quot;Out of sight, out of mind&quot; campaign; 
            further notes that recent figures published show that 91 people have 
            been diagnosed as HIV positive in the first six months of this year 
            compared with 154 in total for the previous year and that, if this 
            trend continues for the rest of the year, it would represent an 18% 
            increase over last year; further notes that, if the number of people 
            aged 15 to 24 being diagnosed as HIV positive continues at the current 
            rate, there will be a 47% increase by the end of the year, and therefore 
            urges the Scottish Executive to undertake a high profile national 
            campaign on HIV and AIDS awareness.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2449</strong> <strong>Mr Murray Tosh: Convenerships 
            and vice-convenerships of committees</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that the convenerships and vice-convenerships of the Parliament's 
            committees were allocated initially on a proportional basis; agrees 
            that these posts should always be allocated proportionally; recognises 
            that the Labour Party, with 42.6% of the seats in the Parliament, 
            now holds 53% of the committee convenerships and 47% of the vice-convenerships, 
            and calls upon the Parliamentary Bureau to take the initiative in 
            restoring proportionality following any personnel changes arising 
            from a reshuffle of Scottish Executive ministers. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2448</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Election of First

            the opportunity to question those nominated for the post of First 
            Minister before the Parliament votes to decide on the successful nominee.

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2447#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Congestion 
            and Pollution caused by Edinburgh "Bus Wars"</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the escalation of the &quot;bus wars&quot; in the 
            city of Edinburgh, a situation which is detrimental to routes, services 
            and passengers and which results in congestion and pollution in some 
            areas, at the same time as routes and services are lost in others, 
            and urges all responsible parties to take appropriate action to address 
            this situation and to allow Scotland&#146;s capital city to develop 
            an integrated transport network in the 21st Century.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2446#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: National Mouth 
            Cancer Awareness Week</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the 
            importance of National Mouth Cancer Awareness Week in highlighting 
            the need for people to visit the dentist regularly to ensure early 
            detection and treatment of oral cancer; is concerned that the incidence 
            of oral cancer has increased by one third over the last fifteen years; 
            is aware of the research by the British Dental Association which showed 
            that one in two people are more likely to visit a dentist regularly 
            if there is no charge for an NHS dental check up, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should consider the restoration of free dental 
            check ups as part of its review of charging policy within the health 
            service. </p>

            capability and security in the current international situation and

            companies, agencies and organisations in Scotland, and furthermore 
            notes with concern the new proposals in regard to detention without 
            trial in clauses 21 to 32 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security 
            Bill which are a suspension of the normal Scottish criminal justice

            2001 with a view to legislation being enacted before July 2002; notes 
            the widespread support for this proposed reform and therefore calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to set up a working group, which includes 
            members of the Transport and the Environment Committee, non-governmental 
            organisations and other experts as a matter of urgency to co-ordinate 
            the drafting and wider consultation on the Bill; agrees that the improved 
            protection of nature requires a combination of both new legislation 
            and integrated land use policies and incentives currently being developed 
            by the Executive; further notes that the protection of Scotland&#146;s 
            natural heritage will require the practice of environmentally sustainable 
            development to be applied across all departments of the Executive, 
            and, to that end, calls for the Ministerial Group on Sustainable Scotland 
            and the Executive&#146;s Sustainable Development Unit to be given 
            a central role within the Executive and for the re-instatement of 
            a dedicated Environment Minister with responsibility for championing 
            sustainable development.&quot;</a> </p>
