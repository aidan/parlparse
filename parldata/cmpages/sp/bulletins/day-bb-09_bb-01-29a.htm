<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary  Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>  Scottish  Labour Party Debate: Forestry</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3325 Sarah Boyack</strong>: <strong>Forestry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes  widespread and clearly expressed public concern about the potential effects on  biodiversity, access, employment and the ability of Forestry Commission Scotland  to continue to carry out its functions effectively as a result of the Scottish  Government&rsquo;s proposals to lease large tracts of the forestry estate to the  private sector for decades into the future; notes that the Parliament is being  asked by the Scottish Government to scrutinise a proposal that it has now said  does &ldquo;not necessarily represent the best or only option&rdquo; to achieve its  objectives; also notes that the Scottish Government has not set out what it  believes would be the other or better options; further notes the lack of  published detail or business plan and the inability of the Scottish Government  to answer a series of questions on the full implications of its proposals at  this time, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider its plans to  proceed with the leasing proposal and end the uncertainty surrounding the proposals  by dropping the provisions that would permit this from the Climate Change  (Scotland) Bill. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding  Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3325.1  Michael Russell: Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3325)  in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out from &ldquo;widespread&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;theconsultation on climate change and forestry that has just  closed; welcomes the widespread agreement that there must be a significant  planting increase to assist the process of combating climate change; is  grateful to all those who brought a variety of ideas and views forward, and  looks forward to a report to the Parliament on the outcome of the consultation.&rdquo;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The  Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-3325.1.1 John Scott:</strong>  Forestry&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-3325.1) in the name of Michael  Russell, insert at end &ldquo;and to subsequent detailed parliamentary scrutiny of  any proposals brought forward as a result of the consultation.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3325.2 Jim Hume: Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3325)  in the name of Sarah Boyack, after &ldquo;future&rdquo; insert &ldquo;; recognises with concern  that the loss of potentially 100,000 hectares of estate earmarked for this  lease option represents 35 to 40% of Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s (FCS)  timber income and 25% of its land mass; notes that diminishing FCS income by  such a significant proportion could lead to the loss of investment for new  leisure and tourism facilities, other woodland initiatives and research and  development on renewable energy and could, in the longer term, threaten  existing facilities and projects due to a restricted maintenance budget;  further notes the potential detrimental impact that giving away full cutting  rights could have on sawmills, smaller timber contractors and timber companies  that often rely on cutting contracts granted to them by FCS to sustain their  businesses; believes that the lease option has been drawn up without  considering the impact on rural and remote communities and without considering  other land uses and land-use policies in an integrated approach;&rdquo;. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>  Scottish  Labour Party Debate: Transport Priorities</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3322 Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Transport Priorities</strong>&mdash;That the  Parliament notes that the Strategic Transport Projects Review lacks detail on  timescales and does not commit the Scottish Government to deliver a programme  of expenditure for the vast majority of the projects identified; also notes the  concern of communities along the length of the A82, A77, A9 and A96 that no  indication has been given as to when their needs for road improvements will be  addressed; notes in particular the disappointment of people in Elgin, Inverness  and Maybole who were led to believe by the SNP prior to the 2007 election that  their bypass schemes would be given priority by an SNP government, and reminds  ministers of the principle of collective responsibility and the need to ensure  that communities are not misled about the Scottish Government&rsquo;s intentions. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding  Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3322.2  Stewart Stevenson: Transport Priorities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3322)  in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &ldquo;lacks&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;(STPR)  focuses on the three STPR priorities of addressing safety on the network,  maximising use of the network and making focused investments that deliver  national benefits and notes that the STPR is not the only mechanism for the  delivery of surface transport infrastructure supported by the Scottish  Government which also involves working with regional transport partnerships and  councils and that the Scottish Government is engaging with local communities  such as Elgin, Inverness and Maybole to deliver solutions to a range of  transport infrastructure issues that have important local benefits.&rdquo; </p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3322.3  Alex Johnstone: Transport Priorities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3322)  in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &ldquo;and, while recognising that the new  Forth Replacement Crossing is an overriding priority for Scotland, calls on the  Scottish Government to state its priorities by reference to the projects listed  in the Strategic Transport Projects Review and others identified by regional  transport partnerships and local authorities as having a major regional  significance.&rdquo;</p>
