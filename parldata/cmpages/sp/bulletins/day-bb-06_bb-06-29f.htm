<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4641</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Nuclear Power in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that decisions on energy and climate change are of hugely significant importance to the people, the economy and the environment of Scotland; further recognises that we are no nearer to delivering a solution to the problem of nuclear waste than we were 30 years ago and that we are at least 40 years from any realistic method of long-term storage; recognises that nuclear power will not tackle climate change; notes that imported sources of high-grade uranium ore are finite and that the carbon emissions associated with nuclear power rise further above those of the most efficient fossil fuel power stations as lower grades are used; recognises that Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy resource has the capacity to power Scotland many times over; further recognises the potential for energy savings through conservation and efficiency measures which pound-for-pound make much more economic sense than wasting money on nuclear power; notes that the new generation of nuclear power stations will result in a more-than-threefold increase in the amount of high-level nuclear waste to be dealt with; recognises that the building of new nuclear power stations would send a dangerous and misleading message to all countries in the world regarding the proliferation of nuclear technology and would add to the potential of devastating terrorist action; notes that nuclear power is uneconomic and that decommissioning will require massive public subsidy, on top of the already expanding budget of over &pound;70 billion, to deal with the legacy of current stations; recognises the important opportunity to decentralise energy production which would itself increase energy efficiency by 50%, and agrees with the Commission for Sustainable Development that it is political willpower that is needed, not nuclear power, to address climate change and energy security now and for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4640</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>The Future is Renewable</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that Ocean Power Delivery (OPD) has secured &pound;13 million of funding from a consortium of private investors; believes that offshore renewables, including wave power, have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s future economy; notes the findings of <em>Delivering the New Generation of Energy: A Route Map to Scotland&rsquo;s Renewable Future,</em> a study by the Scottish Renewables Forum showing that renewables can supply the majority of Scotland&rsquo;s annual electricity needs; welcomes recent reports indicating that the First Minister favours an expansion of the Scottish renewables industry in preference to new nuclear power, and calls on the Scottish Executive not only to embrace the full economic, social and environmental potential of Scotland&rsquo;s renewable resource as part of a truly sustainable energy policy but also to provide the practical support which the industry requires to achieve that potential.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4639</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Hidden Work - Support the Co-production Sector</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Hidden Work, </em>a report by the New Economics Foundation and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on co-production by people outside paid employment; notes the success of agencies such as the Gorbals Initiative in rebuilding social capital and community cohesion; acknowledges the need to develop ways for people outside paid work who are engaged in useful activity in their neighbourhoods to receive income sufficient to maintain a decent quality of life, and calls on the Scottish Executive to heed the report&rsquo;s conclusions and to recognise and support the co-production sector.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4638#</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>The Parliament and the Childcare Agenda</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of childcare provision to working parents in Scotland and reiterates the vision stated at the opening of the Parliament that it would be different, bold and modern in supporting a family-friendly agenda in Scotland; looks forward to the publication of the initial findings of the longitudinal study by the Scottish Executive, &quot;Growing up in Scotland&quot;, which has focused heavily on childcare needs and experiences in Scotland in the early years of its study of 9,000 children; asserts its own responsibility to take a lead as policy-maker, public institution and employer, both in word and deed, in driving forward a family-friendly childcare agenda which delivers quality, flexibility and choice for working parents; welcomes the recent pilot extension of the Parliament&rsquo;s visitors&rsquo; cr&egrave;che to include a short-term drop-in facility for passholders, and affirms its commitment to continue to look at innovative ways of leading the childcare agenda in Scotland, in addition to working in partnership with other employers, institutions and organisations in Edinburgh to deliver best practice in supporting choice and flexibility for excellent childcare provision in the city.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4637</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>M74 Legal Case</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with dismay that Friends of the Earth Scotland has been forced to withdraw from its legal case in the Court of Session against the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with construction of the M74 urban motorway; believes that this demonstrates the barriers faced by individuals and organisations seeking access to environmental justice; congratulates Friends of the Earth Scotland for its courageous decision to bring the case; believes that the ever-escalating cost of the project means that to proceed with construction would be a gross waste of public money; agrees with the findings of the independent public inquiry into the road that, &quot;the public benefits of the proposal would be insufficient to outweigh the considerable disadvantages that can be expected&quot;, and believes that proceeding with construction of the road would drive a bulldozer through the Executive&rsquo;s social justice, climate change and sustainable development commitments.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4636</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Creeping Privatisation of the Royal Mail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the creeping privatisation of the Royal Mail and, in particular, the closure of Crown post offices in towns and cities across Scotland; further notes that franchises cannot replace the service provided to communities by such post offices and is concerned that allowing franchises to take over will serve to exploit workers who currently earn &pound;9.60 an hour and will be expected to do the same job for &pound;5.15 an hour, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ask for an immediate review of the current status and number of Crown post offices in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4635</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Happy Canada Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes all Canadians living in Scotland, and those with Canadian sympathies, a happy Canada Day on 1 July 2006; recognises that it was 139 years ago that the British North America Act 1867 created the Dominion of Canada and began the process of devolving power away from the London parliament to the Canadian state, and notes that highlights of this process included joining the League of Nations in 1921, the Statute of Westminster in 1931 which gave Canada complete control over both foreign affairs and domestic matters, the Citizenship Act of 1947 by which Canadians ceased to be British subjects and were created Canadian citizens, the loss of the House of Lords in 1949 as the final court of appeal for Canadians, to be replaced with the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Constitution Act of 1982 by which the parliament in London ceded its remaining powers over Canada.</p>
