            and in <em>Early Education and Childcare Workforce Survey Final Report</em> 
            which highlighted that local authority nursery schools performed consistently 
            and substantially better in the quality of learning experiences and 
            that 13% of their staff have a teaching degree compared with 6% in 
            the private and 5% in the voluntary centres and how it will ensure 
            that quality will not be diminished under the new staffing guidelines. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>S1W-27108</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan:</strong> To ask

            <em>Guidance on Involvement of Teachers in Pre-school Education </em>on

            on the provision and delivery of the 3-5 curriculum will be as a result 
            of these changes.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-27111</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> To ask
