<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3055</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Waverley is a Secure Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates those at Edinburgh Waverley station who have helped in its re-accreditation under the Secure Station Scheme; notes the nationwide role that the scheme plays in promoting good practice and fostering partnerships between the British Transport Police and local stakeholders in the implementation of security measures, and recognises the importance of safe public transport in encouraging everyone to make greater use of more sustainable methods of travel and in reducing the country&rsquo;s carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3054</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water&rsquo;s Warm Pipes Campaign 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Scottish Water&rsquo;s Warm Pipes Campaign 2008 and believes that this initiative will provide people with important information as the weather gradually worsens over the winter, highlighting ways in which to combat the adverse weather conditions and alerting people to be proactive in beating the cold.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3053</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>UK Government Plans to Treat Lone Parents as Repeat Offenders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at proposals in the UK Government commissioned report, <em>Realising potential: A vision for personalised conditionality and support, </em>by Professor Paul Gregg from Bristol University, to further extend sanctions-based conditionality for groups of persons on incapacity benefit and lone parents; notes that, under the proposals for lone parents, only those with a child under the age of one would be excluded from conditions to take actions to prepare for work; considers that any sanctions imposed on them, where they are described by the Department of Work and Pensions as &quot;repeat offenders&quot;, will further impoverish children, and further considers that lone parents deserve positive measures to support them in seeking suitable work rather than punitive ones.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3052</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Arrrest of British Missionaries in the Gambia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the arrest in the Gambia of Christian missionaries David Fulton, formerly of Troon, and his wife, Fiona, and the fact that they have been charged with sedition; also notes with concern that Mr Fulton is being held at a high security jail outside the capital, Banjul, and that his wife is being held with their two-year-old adopted daughter at a police station in the capital; further notes the criticisms made of the human rights and civil liberties record of the Gambian Government by international rights organisations, and calls on the UK Government to exercise all possible influence to have Mr and Mrs Fulton released.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3051</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Active Scotland Website</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Active Scotland website, www.activescotland.org.uk, which has been developed by NHS Health Scotland as a tool to support the physical activity workforce when working with patients, clients or pupils to answer the question &quot;where do I go to be active?&quot;; notes that the site captures a range of local physical activity opportunities in the form of spaces, places, services and contacts that can help the people of Scotland become more active; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to a healthy Scotland as promoted in <em>Healthy Eating, Active Living: An action plan to improve diet, increase physical activity and tackle obesity (2008-2011), </em>and calls for continued progress to ensure that the people of Scotland enjoy the benefits of an active life.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3050</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>SURF Place Award Winner, Animating the Canal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates West Dunbartonshire Council and its partners on winning the Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum (SURF) award in the Place category for its Animating the Canal project at Clydebank Town Centre; notes that the judges believe that &quot;the creation of an iconic bridge canopy has given back to Clydebank a strong sense of identity and civic pride in its canal front&quot;, and further congratulates the project for creating a space that can be enjoyed by the whole community.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3005</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Supporting Kinship Carers - No to UK Clawback</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the UK Government&rsquo;s Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to update rules regarding kinship carers of looked-after children to ensure that no kinship carer loses out on the new allowances agreed in the historic concordat between Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities and the Scottish Government; acknowledges that some kinship carers are currently in receipt of state benefits that may be clawed back by the DWP, if the rules are not amended, rendering the kinship care allowance pointless for some families and potentially resulting in Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities and the Scottish Government effectively subsidising the UK treasury, and believes that any clawback would not only be an unacceptable way to treat our kinship carers but would also hamper the clear policy objectives of the democratically-elected Scottish Government and local authorities in Scotland.</p>
