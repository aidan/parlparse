            the multinational company, Lafarge to finally give up plans for a 
            superquarry on Harris in the Western Isles; congratulates local people 
            and the Scottish LINK Quarry Group for defending the local community 
            against the threat to their economy and environment over more than 
            a decade of campaigning, and considers that the current planning review 
            provides a vital opportunity to improve the planning system to ensure 
            that local communities across Scotland are better protected and less 
            vulnerable to the power of multinational companies pursuing unsustainable 
            and environmentally destructive developments.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1151#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Posthumous

            the call for posthumous pardons to be granted to suffrage supporters 
            who went to prison during the votes for women campaign between 1909 
            and 1914.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1150</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Respite 
            Care for Young Disabled Persons in Forth Valley</strong>-That the 
            Parliament recognises the significant role played by Headway and the 
            Princess Royal Trust for Carers in providing much needed assistance 
            and support to the families of young disabled persons; notes the lack 
            of young persons in patient rehabilitation beds within the Forth Valley 
            area, and calls upon NHS Forth Valley to put in place a strategy to 
            provide more dedicated services for young disabled persons, in particular 
            for respite breaks and in-patient rehabilitation.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1149</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Sellafield 
            Clean Up</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the continued refusal 
            of the Westminster Government to allow full safety inspections at 
            Sellafield; further condemns the fact that the Westminster Government 
            has consistently failed to allow EU inspectors to ascertain whether 
            or not the 1.3 tonnes of plutonium, currently stored at Sellafield, 
            has ended up in nuclear weapons; notes the decision of the European 
            Commission to extend the deadline for a clean up plan to 1 June 2004, 
            and calls on the Westminster Government to open up all of its nuclear 
            facilities to EU inspectors.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1148</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Fire-Safe

            Parliament on its recent Bill requiring all cigarettes sold in Canada 
            to be self-extinguishing; recognises that lit cigarettes are the leading 
            cause of fire fatalities within Scotland, and now looks forward to 
            the Scottish Parliament bringing forward similar legislation introducing 
            fire-safe cigarettes and helping to decrease the large number of avoidable 
            deaths within Scotland from the aftermath of lit cigarettes.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1147</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Threat

            notes with concern the financial problems that the Mayflower Corporation 
            is facing; acknowledges the work done by Falkirk Council, Scottish 
            Enterprise and Mayflower in their proposal to secure 1,000 jobs at 
            the Glenbervie site, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to assist 
            Falkirk Council in protecting the TransBus operation in Falkirk, in 
            order that these highly skilled jobs can be secured and that the long 
            standing manufacture of buses continues in the Falkirk area.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1146</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>EOC 
            &quot;It's Time to Get Even&quot; Campaign</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the &quot;It's Time to Get Even&quot; campaign by the Equal 
            Opportunities Commission (EOC) Scotland to highlight pay inequalities 
            between men and women; further notes that the average pay gap between 
            men and women is £482 per month, and congratulates EOC Scotland for 
            bringing forward this high profile campaign and drawing attention 
            to this extremely serious issue.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1145#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Threat 
            to Jobs at TransBus International</strong>-That the Parliament is 
            gravely concerned about the fact that the Mayflower Corporation has 
            entered administration with a resultant threat to 1,000 jobs at TransBus 
            International in Falkirk and Larbert and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should contact the employees' trade union representatives, 
            the administrator and any prospective buyers to offer assistance and 
            advice so that everything possible is done to try to save the jobs 
            of the TransBus workers who make a very important contribution to 
            the Scottish economy.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1144#</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Chiropody 
            Care</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance of regular 
            chiropody and foot care in keeping Scotland's elderly population mobile, 
            pain free and independent; considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            specify who is eligible for NHS chiropody and podiatry care, noting 
            that local access policies differ throughout Scotland and promote 
            variances in the provision of foot care, and further considers that 
            NHS boards should ensure that access to foot health services are maintained 
            in a fair and equitable manner to all patient groups including the 
            elderly and schoolchildren.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1140</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Swimming 
            for Senior Citizens</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the actions 
            of North Lanarkshire Council which has increased the cost of swimming 
            in its baths and leisure centres for pensioners by 200%; believes 
            that the actions of the council are contrary to the policies of the 
            Scottish Executive in promoting the health and well-being of our nation, 
            particularly older people; recognises that swimming is an accessible 
            method of keeping fit for those older people experiencing some form 
            of ill health or as a formal part of their medical care; notes that 
            the price change will adversely affect pensioners who will not be 
            able to afford this increase and who will consequently cease their 
            participation, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
            deliver a national policy of free swimming for older people throughout 
            Scotland.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1138</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>The 
            Kenny Macintyre Media Centre</strong>-That the Parliament hopes that 
            the name &quot;Kenny Macintyre Media Centre&quot; as the title of 
            the Parliament's current media centre will continue to be used in 
            the new parliament building.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1137#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Standard 
            Life Job Losses</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the decision 
            by Standard Life to sack 1,000 staff by the end of the year; is not 
            convinced that the company will reduce risk to its customers or staff 
            by these measures and notes with concern the long-term impact on staff 
            and policyholders of the move towards demutualisation announced today, 
            and considers it to be imperative that the company should open talks 
            with a recognised trade union to ensure that staff are protected and 
            treated fairly at this time.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1136#</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Scotland's

            importance of Scotland's equine sports industry for the development 
            of Scotland's rural economy; commends the work of the Scottish Equestrian 
            Association in seeking to coordinate equine-related policy decisions, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should set up a dedicated 
            equine industry team within its Environment and Rural Affairs Department.</P>

            Trades Union Council for organising a night to commemorate the life 
            of Michael McGahey, the former leader of the National Union of Miners 
            in Scotland; notes the success of last year's inaugural event; further 
            notes that the 2004 event will take place in Loanhead Miners Welfare 
            Society and Social Club on Saturday 1 May 2004, and wishes Michael

          <p><strong>S2M-1133</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>May

            to the Edinburgh May Day committee and its 2004 celebrations to mark 
            International Workers Day; notes that this year's theme is to commemorate 
            the 20th anniversary of the 1984-85 miners' strike, and further notes 
            that Arthur Scargill, former leader of the National Union of Miners, 
            Tommy Sheridan MSP, Bill Speirs, General Secretary of the Scottish 
            Trades Union Council, Hilary Wainwright, Editor of <em>Red Pepper</em> 
            magazine and a Palestinian representative will lead the parade through

          <p><strong>S2M-1132</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> <strong>Chardon

            Bayer Crop Science that it will not attempt to grow Chardon LL GM 
            maize in the UK commercially; notes that this is the result of the 
            tough, restrictive regime supported by the Scottish Executive; believes 
            that this announcement fully justifies the precautionary approach, 
            based on scientific evidence, that the Executive has taken; further 
            believes that calls for an illegal blanket ban on GM could have been 
            challenged in the courts and led to court approval for commercial 
            planting of a GM crop, and calls on the Executive to continue to deliver 
            more sustainable agriculture, promoting organic farming, consumer 
            choice and quality Scottish produce.</P>

            LL Maize</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1132) in the name 
            of Nora Radcliffe, leave out from &quot;tough&quot; to &quot;continue&quot; 
            and insert &quot;poor performance of Chardon LL as a crop; further 
            notes how this poor performance could be used by the Scottish Executive 
            as a valid reason to reject the addition of the crop to the UK seed 
            list; believes that the Executive is failing to use its wide legal 
            powers of discretion as exercised by EU states in relation to GM crops; 
            further believes that the Executive is relying on the fortuitous decisions 
            of biotechnology companies to make those decisions it is unwilling 
            to make itself, and calls on the Executive.&quot;</P>

            <strong>Chardon LL Maize</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1132) 
            in the name of Nora Radcliffe, leave out from the first &quot;this&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;Bayer took the UK government decision, supported 
            by the Scottish Executive, to give agreement in principle to the commercialisation 
            of Chardon LL as confirmation that the product was &quot;both safe 
            and effective&quot;; believes that decisions on the commercialisation 
            of GM crops should be based on issues of public health and environmental 
            safety rather than being left to the vagaries of the market, and regrets 
            the failure of the Scottish Executive to use its legal powers to take 
            a firmer stand against the commercialisation of Chardon LL maize.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1131</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations

            Time Out Centre, Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 
            establishment of the Scottish Executive funded time out centre, 218, 
            an assessment and referral service to assist in reducing women's offending 
            and the number of women in prison; supports the work undertaken at 
            218 to tackle the root causes of women's offending by offering programmes 
            of care, support and development designed to stop women offending 
            by tackling substance misuse driven by trauma and poverty; is particularly 
            encouraged by the menu of programmes to meet these needs including 
            SAFE, working towards recovery including learning to work with a key 
            worker, substitute prescribing, getting somewhere to live, reducing 
            offending and claiming benefits, CONNEXIONS, more sustained group 
            work, helping women let go of substance misuse and offending, handling 
            reality and learning to look after others as well as themselves, LOSS, 
            letting go of substances, activating plans for a new life in education, 
            work as carers and therapeutic work to begin to address the underlying 
            issues of abuse, neglect, violence and other traumas; notes that women 
            in Glasgow can access this service from court, prison or by themselves 
            if they have had a period of custody in the previous 12 months, and 
            considers that the emphasis on tackling the root causes of women's 
            offending and developing a person-centred alternative lifestyle is 
            a positive development that should be given greater emphasis in the 
            criminal justice system.</P>

            Depression Week, 19 to 25 April 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises that one in five people will suffer from depression at 
            some point in their lives and considers that National Depression Week 
            will highlight the problem; notes the sharp increase in prescription 
            of medication for depression with little or no psychological support 
            and the continued use of the anti-depressant Prozac for those under 
            18; considers this to be an intolerable situation, and calls for the 
            support and resources required to enable a holistic approach to treating 
            depression to be put in place as a matter of urgency.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1127</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>GATS 
            and Water</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes Her Majesty's Government's 
            commitment to the UN's pledge to halve the proportion of people without 
            access to safe drinking water by 2015; notes that access to water 
            is the most basic of human rights; notes concern that &quot;water 
            for human use&quot; is included as a proposal under current negotiations 
            of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) at the World 
            Trade Organisation and that once a country commits its water sector 
            to GATS, this commitment is effectively irreversible, irrespective 
            of the consequences; further notes that current GATS negotiations 
            could threaten the extension of clean water supply to the poorest 
            communities by undermining pro-poor policies such as the preference 
            for public or not-for-profit providers, and calls on Her Majesty's 
            Government to persuade our EU counterparts to withdraw the proposal 
            to bring &quot;water for human use&quot; into the GATS negotiations.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1118#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Massacre 
            of Glenfeshie</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            mass slaughter of deer at Glenfeshie, instigated by the Deer Commission 
            for Scotland; believes that, whilst culling deer is necessary to control 
            numbers, deer fencing is necessary in order to protect forestry and 
            the removal, or non-provision of, deer fencing has contributed substantially 
            to the present situation; further believes that the Deer Commission 
            may intend to carry out further mass slaughter of deer out of season 
            and at various locations in Scotland; considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should meet representatives of the Scottish Gamekeepers 
            Association to hear its concerns regarding the massacre of Glenfeshie 
            and regarding the measures that should be taken in order to secure 
            proper management of both deer and forestry, and, in the meantime, 
            considers that there should be a moratorium on any further mass slaughter 
            of deer in Scotland.</P>

            welcomes the deliberations of the Shetland dialect conference held 
            recently in Scalloway; notes the bearing on these deliberations of 
            recommendations under the current review of the obligations of the 
            Scottish Executive to meet its pledge to promote Scots under the European 
            Charter for Regional or Minority Languages; further notes that this 
            must include creating conditions for the use of Scots in public life, 
            through the adoption of a language policy and concrete measures, in 
            co-operation with the speakers of the language, and considers that 
            Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should 
            make a commitment to a thorough and explicit adherence to the spirit 
            and letter of this review.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1114</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Keep 
            the Flying Scotsman in the UK</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            the Flying Scotsman steam locomotive has been put up for sale with 
            the bidding process ending on 2 April 2004; is concerned that it may 
            be sold abroad if £2 million is not raised; congratulates the National 
            Railway Museum in York and Sir Richard Branson for finding a substantial 
            amount of money for a bid; notes that recently the Scottish Executive 
            gave £6.5 million for the John Murray Manuscript Archive; considers 
            the Flying Scotsman also to be of significant national value to Scotland, 
            given that it was the first locomotive to run from London to Edinburgh 
            non-stop; calls on the Executive to make a contribution to the bid, 
            and hopes that this will keep the locomotive in the United Kingdom 
            and allow it to be seen regularly on the Scottish railway network.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1113#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Amnesty

            the Parliament commends the recent decision of Amnesty International 
            to conduct a sustained campaign to stop violence against women; agrees 
            with Amnesty International that violence against women is deeply embedded 
            in all nations, including our own and that it is found in all social 
            classes, irrespective of income, education or religion; notes with 
            serious concern the prevailing incidence of domestic violence and 
            other forms of violence against women in Scotland; reminds the Scottish 
            Executive, local authorities and the police forces of their legal 
            and moral obligations to protect women from violence, and considers 
            that the Executive should do all in its power to eliminate this vile 
            abuse of human rights in Scotland and to assist, where it can, the 
            international campaign to stop violence against women.</P>
