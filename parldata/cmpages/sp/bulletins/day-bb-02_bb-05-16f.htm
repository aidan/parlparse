            to Avoid Cuts in Public Spending</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the new campaign launched by UNISON, the UK's largest trade union, 
            against the United Kingdom joining the European Single Currency and 
            notes its concern that joining the euro would be a disaster for public 
            services if public spending had to be cut to comply with European 
            Central Bank spending limits.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3121</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Economic Independence 
            of Portugal</strong>-That the Parliament notes the abandonment by 
            the Portugese Government of its economic agenda due to the threat 
            of potential fines and a reduction in European Union development subsidies 
            if it were to breach the tight restrictions of the Stability and Growth 
            Pact which are required as a member of the euro currency and further 
            notes that VAT will rise from 17% to 19%, civil service recruitment 
            has been halted, 30 publicly funded institutions are to close and 
            the independent Government of Portugal has withdrawn its plans to 
            reduce corporation tax which was planned to help kick start its low 
            growth economy.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3116#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Use of Fairtrade 
            Products</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body (SPCB) for offering Fairtrade tea and coffee to members 
            and staff; looks forward to the steps that the SPCB will take to extend 
            the range of fairly traded products; calls upon local authorities 
            throughout Scotland to promote Fairtrade products in their offices 
            and also within local communities by asking supermarkets and local 
            shops to stock Fairtrade products; congratulates those cities and 
            areas such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Strathaven and 
            the Isle of Skye for taking this initiative and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should take the lead and help Scotland become the 
            world's first "Fairtrade country".</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3115</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: University of 
            Glasgow Scottish Politics Course</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the University of Glasgow on its decision to recommence the honours 
            level course in Scottish politics; believes that in this post-devolution 
            era this course is a great asset to the Scottish academic and political 
            community and hopes to see the continuation of this course for many 
            years to come, and congratulates Professor Chris Berry and the excellent 
            Politics Department at the university for taking on board the representations 
            of many who were concerned at the loss of this course.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3114#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Trongate 
            Regeneration</strong>-That the Parliament pledges its full support 
            for the campaign launched by traders in Glasgow's Trongate for the 
            regeneration of the area; notes with concern that the area has suffered 
            from neglect and decline in recent years whilst other parts of the 
            city have benefited from regeneration; supports the demands of the 
            traders for steps to be taken for the area's regeneration, including 
            a new railway station at Glasgow Cross as part of the Glasgow CrossRail 
            scheme, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that 
            measures are put in place to achieve the area's regeneration.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3113#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Diabetes Week 
            9-15 June 2002</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes Diabetes Week 
            from 9-15 June 2002 and commends Diabetes UK on its hard-hitting campaign, 
            &quot;Diabetes - possible to deal with, deadly to ignore&quot;, which 
            underlines the seriousness of diabetes in that, according to research 
            funded by Diabetes UK, people with diabetes are nearly twice as likely 
            to die prematurely as people without the condition; recognises the 
            implications for public health and health education of the recent 
            diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes in children, and believes that the necessary 
            steps should be taken to ensure that people in Scotland, including 
            children, have access to information on diabetes, are made aware of 
            the seriousness of the condition and are supported to adopt healthy 
            lifestyles.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3112</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Scottish Parliamentary

            Commissioner Bill be passed.</a></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3106.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Investment 
            and Reform in Health and Community Care</strong>-As an amendment to

            first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets that the 
            sustainability of investment in health is dependent solely on decisions 
            taken by Her Majesty's Government rather than determined by the Scottish 
            Parliament; agrees that reform in the delivery of health care is essential 
            if we are to create a modern NHS which improves health and tackles 
            health inequalities throughout Scotland, is transparent in its operation 
            and publicly accountable, and prioritises the needs and expectations 
            of patients and service users; is concerned that the Scottish Executive's 
            use of the Private Finance Initiative and private healthcare capacity 
            to redress decades of under-funding by the Tories damages the NHS 
            and undermines the principle of a universal service that is free at 
            the point of need; is further concerned that waiting lists and times 
            are manipulated to the point of being meaningless, and believes that 
            continuing reduction in the NHS acute sector capacity and staff shortages 
            across the range of healthcare professions must be reversed if the 
            NHS is to tackle effectively the crucial issues of bed blocking, waiting 
            lists and times and hospital-acquired infection which remain fundamental 
            obstructions to improving the health of the people of Scotland.&quot;

            believes that the voice of the health workers articulated by the main 
            health union UNISON, the Royal College of Nursing and the STUC on 
            behalf of all health workers is not being listened to sufficiently, 
            particularly in relation to the use of private finance and the need 
            to tackle low wages and therefore agrees to reject the Executive's 
            Private Finance Initiatives in favour of proper public investment 
            and to prioritise wages for low paid health workers and nurses.&quot;</p>

            by reform that is focused on the needs and expectations of patients 
            and service users; supports a collaborative approach to reform which 
            involves patients, staff and the wider public; believes that improving 
            health and tackling health inequalities in both urban and rural Scotland 
            should be central features of the reform agenda; regrets the failure 
            of the Scottish Executive to deal with delayed discharge and hospital-acquired 
            infection; notes that medical activity has decreased, and further 
            notes that the Scottish Executive's National Waiting Times Unit has 
            only achieved success after utilising the independent sector.&quot;</p>

            Strategy</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3105) in the name 
            of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;notes that in February 2000 the European Commission applied 
            for a declaration that the UK had failed to fulfil its obligations 
            in particular under Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on 
            waste, and that the UK accepted this failure and the European Court 
            of Justice found the UK (including Scotland) in breach of a number 
            of waste related Directives; further notes that the National Waste 
            Strategy was published in 1999 together with a commitment to the production 
            of Area Waste Plans by the end of 2000 and that this target date was 
            subsequently extended to a final deadline of March 2002; is concerned 
            with the slow progress being made towards the better management of 
            waste in Scotland, and believes that in order to speed up progress 
            the Executive must firstly introduce mandatory targets, on an all 
            Scotland basis, of 30% to 35% for recycling and composting of household 
            waste by 2010.&quot;</p>

            of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;believes that the Scottish Executive must take the lead on reducing 
            waste and should refuse permission for all new landfill or incinerator 
            applications until a national waste strategy is in place and that 
            this strategy should have at its core a reduction of waste at the 
            beginning of the stream, i.e. packaging, junk mail and a three-stream 
            collection system aiming at a zero waste target such as is already 
            being practised successfully in communities in the USA, Europe and 
            England; further believes that waste must be dealt with in the local 
            authority area where it is produced and not transported about the 
            country to become someone else's problem, and finally believes that 
            a further vital strategy must be the prevention of waste at the point 
            of production which is already being implemented in other European 
            countries, where manufacturers are fined heavily if they produce non-bio-degradable

            an amendment to motion (S1M-3105.3) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave 
            out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the 
            preparation of draft area waste plans; regrets the slow progress being 
            made towards ambitious recycling targets being set in the National 
            Waste Plan; notes the need to build on work done already by local 
            authorities, and recognises the need for community involvement and 
            ownership of the problems of waste disposal at all levels to make 
            a National Waste Strategy effective throughout Scotland.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3105.4</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: National Waste 
            Strategy</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3105) in the name 
            of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;notes that conservation of natural resources, reduction of pollution 
            and creation of employment could be achieved through a National Waste 
            Plan based on minimisation, reuse and recycling of commercial and 
            household waste, that the generation of waste in Scotland is increasing, 
            that most of the waste generated in Scotland arises from commercial 
            and industrial sources, and notes with concern that Scotland currently 
            recycles only about 6% of its household waste; welcomes the publication 
            by local authorities of Area Waste Plans which demonstrate the economic 
            and environmental benefit of minimisation and recycling of waste as 
            an alternative to incineration and landfill dumping; is concerned 
            that there has been insufficient guidance from the Executive for both 
            local authorities and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to 
            implement Area Waste Plans that are based on waste minimisation and 
            recycling and therefore that the Executive's current approach will 
            result in increasing waste generation, the building of several new 
            waste incinerators and continued low levels of waste recycling; is 
            further concerned that community recycling stakeholders are not funded 
            nor sufficiently consulted on the National Waste Plan, and therefore 
            calls on the Executive to adopt a strategy of Zero Waste within the 
            National Waste Plan, based on waste minimisation and recycling, to 
            include mandatory consultation with community-based recyclers, and 
            towards this strategy in the short term (a) to fund investment in 
            kerbside collections from every home, as well as increased recycling 
            at Civic Amenity Sites and an expansion of the existing network of 
            recycling collection sites, (b) to oppose plans for new waste incinerators 
            in Aberdeen and the Highlands; (c) to increase the Strategic Waste 
            Fund to at least £150 million and allow community-based recyclers 
            access to this fund, (d) to stop importation of waste into Scotland 
            from other countries and (e) to set a mandatory target for local authorities 
            for at least 35% recycling of household waste by 2010.&quot;</p>
