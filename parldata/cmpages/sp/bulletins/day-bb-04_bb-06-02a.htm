            that the unstable security situation and the current rules of engagement 
            within Iraq have led to the coalition forces being seen as an army 
            of occupation, and believes, therefore, that to promote future stability 
            in Iraq any foreign troops on Iraqi soil should be brought under UN 
            command and that current coalition forces should be replaced, on a 
            phased basis, by those drawn from non-Western, preferably Muslim, 
            countries pending the restoration of full sovereignty and the consent 
            of the Iraqi people. </P>

                countries in the region, Iraq's neighbours, and regional organisations,

                1511 (2003) on the efforts and progress made by the multinational

                the political transition, especially for upcoming elections, and 
                to provide security for the United Nations presence in Iraq; recognises 
                the importance of the consent of the sovereign government of Iraq 
                for the presence of the multinational force after 30 June and 
                of close co-ordination between the multinational force and that

                couragous, professional and effective manner in which British

                commanders on the ground for further equipment or manpower to 
                enable them to fulfil their task; looks forward to a genuine transfer

                2004 to which, as the civil power, the United Kingdom can continue

                to end and insert &quot;notes the motion passed by the Parliament 
                on 13 March 2003; reaffirms its support for the United Nations 
                and its belief in the primacy of international law; regrets that 
                Her Majesty's Government saw fit to take this country into the 
                Iraq War without United Nations sanction or credible evidence 
                of a significant threat to the safety of the United Kingdom or 
                of the world community; believes that as a consequence the world 
                is now a more dangerous place; notes with concern the deteriorating 
                security situation in Iraq and the Middle East; believes that 
                progress in Iraq is only possible if the role of the United Nations 
                is expanded and enhanced and the transfer of sovereignty to the 
                Iraqis on 30 June 2004 is real and visible; recalls that when 
                the House of Commons endorsed military action against Saddam Hussein 
                it did so on an understanding that progress on the road map for 
                a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians would be 
                a priority for Her Majesty's Government; expresses its disappointment 
                that recent events have made the achievement of a negotiated two-state 
                solution more difficult and less likely; recognises the bravery 
                and professionalism of British armed forces serving in Iraq in 
                difficult and dangerous circumstances; calls upon Her Majesty's 
                Government not to commit any further troops unless requested by 
                United Kingdom commanders in Iraq for the purposes of securing 
                the safety of British forces and the fulfilling of Britain's international 
                obligations towards the people of Iraq and to the United Nations, 
                and further declares that any such troops should remain under 
                United Kingdom operational command and within the area currently 
                under United Kingdom control.&quot; </P>

                to end and insert &quot;believes that all British troops should 
                be withdrawn from Iraq immediately; considers that the decision 
                to invade Iraq was based on lies, deceit and distortion and that 
                President George W Bush and Tony Blair are guilty of wilful deception 
                in relation to weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi links to the 
                September 11 atrocity and Iraq posing an imminent &quot;45-minute&quot; 
                threat to British interests; further considers that the invasion 
                of Iraq was illegal under international law and the continued 
                presence of coalition troops represents an illegal occupation; 
                believes that the billions of pounds committed to waging war in 
                Iraq should be diverted to agencies like the Red Cross, Red Crescent, 
                M&eacute;dicins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and others to assist in 
                the rebuilding of Iraq's infrastructure with the consent of the 
                Iraqi people and that peace across the Middle East will be only 
                secured on the basis of a free and viable Palestine requiring 
                the withdrawal of Israel from Palestinian territory; further believes 
                that Scotland's name should be synonymous with peaceful resolution 
                of the world's problems and conflicts, and extends the hand of 
                peace and friendship internationally.&quot; </P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1329</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Affordable 
            Housing in North-east Fife</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the shortage of affordable housing for rent or sale in many 
            communities in north-east Fife; recognises that this is due to many 
            factors including the decline in the amount of public sector rented 
            accommodation, the popularity of many communities as retirement and 
            holiday locations and, in the case of St Andrews, the accommodation 
            needs of the growing student population; expresses its concern about 
            the difficulties faced by many people in trying to obtain affordable 
            accommodation in their own communities and the pressures on rural 
            services such as schools, and considers that Fife Council, Communities 
            Scotland and the Scottish Executive should develop an effective housing 
            plan for north-east Fife that addresses these concerns to ensure viable, 
            vibrant and sustainable communities throughout north-east Fife. </P>
