            <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">6.&#9;The basic principle 
              is that the wishes of the constituent are paramount. In particular, 
              a constituent has the right to approach his or her constituency 
              MSP, or any of the seven regional MSPs elected in his or her region. 
              They also have the right to expect an MSP to take on a case though 
              the MSP must be able to judge how best to do so. It is expected, 
              however, that, in practice, the usual point of contact for a constituent 
              raising a specific personal or local matter will be his or her constituency 
              MSP. In the event that a regional ('list') MSP does raise a constituency 
              case (for example with a Minister or local authority) he or she 
              must notify the relevant constituency MSP at the outset unless the 
              consent of the constituent is withheld. A suggested pro-forma for 
              this purpose is attached at Appendix A.</font></p>
            <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">7.&#9;Ministers or agencies 
              such as local authorities and health boards, who are in correspondence 
              with MSPs on such constituency issues, should <u>not</u> notify 
              other MSPs representing the area. That would breach the confidential 
              nature of the relationship between constituent and MSP. The only 
              exception is where constituency cases raise more general issues 
              of relevance to the whole constituency or area. In those circumstances, 
              a Minister or agency may judge it appropriate to notify other MSPs 
              with an interest of the general issue. They should not, however, 
              refer to, or identify, individual constituents in doing so. Staff 
              working on behalf of Ministers or agencies should be made aware 
              of and apply these guidelines.</font></p>

              It is recognised that this might involve such agencies (NDPBs, local 
              authorities, health boards etc) in dealing with potentially large 
              numbers of MSPs, in particular, where agency boundaries cross regional 
              boundaries. The expectation therefore is that the constituency Member 
              or Members will be involved as a matter of course and that agencies 
              will make appropriate arrangements to maintain contact and consult 
              with regional list MSPs which have relevant regional representation 
              perhaps through a representative regional list MSP nominated by 
              each party. Agencies are free to inform or consult these nominated 
              members either jointly with constituency members, or seperately. 
              This does not affect the right of any Member representing a constituency

            <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">17.&#9;It follows from 
              the first and second principles and from what is said above that 
              regional Members have responsibility to <u>all</u> those in the

              they recognise this in the way in which they operate within the

              between constituency and regional Members. The following is of critical 
              relevance in dealing with any complaints regarding these matters. 
              Regional Members are expected to work in more than 2 constituencies 
              within their region. Evidence that they were doing so would include 
              holding surgeries in more than 2 constituencies (though regional<strong> 
              </strong>Members do have the option of holding surgeries in their Party's<strong> 
              </strong>regional office <u>only</u>) and dealing with local authorities 
              and other agencies and constituents in more than 2 constituencies 
              within their region. Regional Members would also, of course, be 
              expected to deal (as appropriate) with any matter raised by any 
              constituent within their region.</font></p>
