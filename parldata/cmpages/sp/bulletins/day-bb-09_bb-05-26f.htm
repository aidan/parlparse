<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>S3M-4166</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Quarriers&rsquo; Epilepsy Support</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Quarriers for the invaluable support it provides to people with epilepsy across Scotland; supports Quarriers&rsquo; work in highlighting the misconceptions surrounding epilepsy during National Epilepsy Week, 17 to 23 May 2009; recognises the important role played by Quarriers&rsquo; fieldworkers in ensuring that people with epilepsy are motivated to achieve their full potential in their own communities; commends the work of the Quarriers&rsquo; National Epilepsy Centre for Scotland, the only facility of its kind in Scotland, and further praises Quarriers&rsquo; commitment to raising awareness of this condition and delivering care of the highest quality across Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4165</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Scottish Renewables Festival 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament looks forward to the Scottish Renewables Festival, which will run on the weekend of 13-14 June 2009 at venues across the whole of Scotland, giving the public a chance to learn more about renewable energy; notes that the festival will allow people to see wind farms, hydropower plants, marine energy demonstrations and biomass heat and power plants, as well as household and community installations of solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps and wood fuel; believes that, with the continuing harnessing of Scotland&rsquo;s rich and diverse renewable energy resources being of vital importance to our environment and economy, it is important that people get to see for themselves what renewable energy is all about, and congratulates Scottish Renewables and all other bodies involved in setting up and running this welcome new addition to Scotland&rsquo;s festivals.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4164</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Welcome Retention of Low Moss Prison Name</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Prison Service&rsquo;s decision to retain the name of HMP Low Moss in East Dunbartonshire, noting the hard work of many members of the local community who have campaigned for the retention of this name.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4163</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Prison to be Named Low Moss</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news from the Scottish Prison Service that the new prison being built in East Dunbartonshire will keep the name, HMP Low Moss; notes the concerted campaign by members of the public who were against the working title, HMP Bishopbriggs, as the name for the new prison from the outset, and acknowledges that common sense has prevailed in the naming of the new prison.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4162</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Robert Burns Humanitarian Award 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Guy Willoughby, director of the Halo Trust, on being chosen to receive the Robert Burns Humanitarian Award 2009; notes that the Halo Trust is a not-for-profit organisation based in south west Scotland, which specialises in the removal of the hazardous debris of war; further notes that it has 8,000 full-time mine clearers in nine countries, with ongoing surveys into new regions; also notes that, since it was founded 21 years ago, it has destroyed over one million landmines, 10 million items of larger calibre ordnance, over 50 million bullets, over 2,800 heavy weapon systems and over 85,000 assault rifles and has cleared over 6,000 minefields, making thousands of hectares of land and roads safe; believes that this is a testament to the dedication of the staff who are working in some of the most dangerous jobs on earth, and thanks everyone who has worked with Guy Willoughby to undertake this immensely valuable work in some of the poorest countries in the world.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4150#</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Electronic Indentification of Sheep</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the EU Council of Ministers has voted to press ahead with the introduction of compulsory electronic identification (EID) of sheep across the European Union; recognises that this decision was taken despite outright opposition from some member states and growing unease among others about the cost and practicalities of such a scheme; doubts that a system of EID can be found that is workable on most of Scotland&rsquo;s sheep farms, particularly those in the Highlands and Islands; further notes that &pound;3 million has been committed to a large-scale pilot to try to find a workable and cost-effective solution, and believes that the European Commission has much to learn from observing the pilot and, should a solution not be identified, that a derogation from a compulsory EID scheme would be in the best interests of Scotland&rsquo;s sheep farmers.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4143.1</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>48 Hour Working Time Directive</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4143) in the name of John Wilson, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the UK Government failed to reach an agreement with the European Union with regard to the decision to opt out of the 48 hour working time directive; believes that the defeat of the plans is good news for Scotland&rsquo;s retained fire service and the communities that rely on it; is surprised that SNP members should express such inconsistent views on these proposals, which posed such a grave threat to the service provided by retained firefighters across Scotland; recognises the need for sufficient flexibility in the working time directive to allow retained firefighters to provide vital fire and rescue services in Scotland&rsquo;s most remote areas, and therefore calls on ministers to be vigilant and ensure that they keep up the pressure as the European Commission consults on the way forward.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4063 *#*</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Supporting the Living Wage for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish Living Wage Employer Awards being held in Dalmarnock; regrets the fact that there are around 700,000 workers in Scotland, the majority of them women, earning less than the Scottish living wage of &pound;7.00 per hour; is aware that low pay can lock people into poverty and can be damaging for individuals, families, businesses, communities and the wider economy, and recognises the importance of encouraging employers in the public, private and voluntary sectors to ensure that all low-paid workers are paid no less than the Scottish living wage of &pound;7.00 per hour.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3741#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Inadequate Infertility Treatment in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that couples seeking fertility treatment in the NHS have to wait for 20 months in Glasgow, 13 months in Lanarkshire, 13 months in Ayrshire and Arran, 15 months in Dumfries and Galloway, three years in Lothian, six months for Lothian self-funding, up to 18 months in Grampian, up to 14 months in Highland, 12 months in Tayside, up to two years in Fife and up to two years in Forth Valley and that Orkney decides on a case-by-case basis; is pleased to learn that Shetland has no waiting restrictions; is extremely disturbed to note that Fife NHS board ranks among the worst providers of the service in Scotland in that each frozen embryo is counted as a cycle when other NHS boards require fresh and frozen embryo(s) to count as a cycle and that Fife NHS board only provides two cycles whereas other NHS boards provide three, thereby effectively giving Fife couples a third less of an opportunity for this treatment that some other couples in Scotland have; expresses particular concern that when a woman is in a relationship with a partner who has a child from a previous relationship she is denied access to any form of NHS provision in this area of specialism, and considers that NHS Lothian provides an example in increasing the age at which it accepts prospective fertility treatment candidates in consideration of the fact that many couples will not know that they need fertility treatment until their late 30s and are subsequently restricted by the unacceptable waiting times.</p>
