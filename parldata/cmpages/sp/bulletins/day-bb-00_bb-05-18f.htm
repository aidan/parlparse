    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-877</b> <strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: Standards in Scotland's Schools etc.
    Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that the Standards in Scotland&#146;s Schools
    etc. Bill be passed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-876</b> <strong>Henry McLeish: Education and Training (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Education and Training (Scotland)
    Bill. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-875</b> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Belmont Academy and Motorola Youth
    Parliament Competition</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils and staff of
    Belmont Academy in Ayr, who won the Scottish Section of the Motorola Youth Parliament
    Competition and went on to take third place in the UK competition.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-874#</b> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Young People and Transport</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament welcomes the recent publication by the Save the Children Fund (SCF) of the
    report <i>Going My Way: What Children and Young People Say About Transport</i>; believes
    that the report highlights the problems which many young people face in accessing
    transport in rural areas such as Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, and asks the Scottish
    Executive to give consideration to adopting the recommendations of the report which
    include the creation of a national subsidised youth fare scheme for 16 and 17 year olds,
    the creation of further opportunities for the development of Home Zones and support for
    local authorities to designate 10mph speed limits in appropriate areas.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-873</b> <strong>Nick Johnston: AIDS and Hepatitis C Education</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises that AIDS and Hepatitis C are a major threat to the wellbeing of
    the people of Scotland and calls upon the Scottish Executive to consider new public
    education measures against the dissemination of AIDS and Hepatitis C and to raise
    awareness throughout Scotland of the serious health implications of both AIDS and
    Hepatitis C.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Mr Keith Harding<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-871#</b> <strong>Michael Russell: Shirley McKie and the Scottish
    Criminal Records Office</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the prosecution of Shirley
    McKie for perjury arising out of a Strathclyde Police investigation, the complete
    vindication of Shirley McKie following trial, and the body of evidence collated by BBC <i>Frontline
    Scotland</i> which proves, with the involvement of leading international fingerprint
    experts, that the fingerprint evidence led at her case was false; regrets that there has
    yet to be any attempt to apologise to, or secure financial restitution for, Shirley McKie
    despite her great personal suffering and the loss of her career in Strathclyde Police;
    expresses concern that the fingerprint officers from the Scottish Criminal Record Office
    (SCRO) involved in her case have not been suspended and that no full and independent
    investigation has been ordered by the Scottish Executive into the actions of either
    Strathclyde Police or SCRO, and considers that the Scottish Executive should accept the
    implications of the McKie case which must include such investigations as well as a
    complete re-examination of criminal prosecutions involving fingerprint identification from
    SCRO and those officers.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-870</b> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Expedition to the North Pole</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament congratulates Stonehaven man Charlie Paton, his colleague Alan Chambers and
    the other members of the expeditionary team on their achievement in becoming the first
    Britons to walk unsupported to the North Pole, an accomplishment which reflects highly on
    the individuals concerned and the Royal Marines Condor unit based in Arbroath.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-868.1</b> <strong>Kay Ullrich: Community Care</strong>&#151;As an amendment
    to motion (S1M-868) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end
    and insert &quot;supports the concept of care in the community; recognises the excellent
    work done in the Sutherland Report on long term care <i>With Respect to Old Age</i>;
    condemns the continued failure of the Executive to implement fully the recommendations of
    that Royal Commission; demands adequate funding for those providing services within local
    government and the voluntary sector; urges the Executive to accept responsibility for
    community care, and invites it to provide real leadership, and the necessary funding, to
    enable successful joint working in this field.&quot;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-868.2</b> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Community Care</strong>&#151;As an amendment
    to motion (S1M-868) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end
    and insert &quot;notes that the Scottish Executive&#146;s approach to community care has
    resulted in a 40% increase in blocked beds in acute hospitals since 1997, to a total of
    2,400 in the latest delayed discharge census, and that this costs the NHS in Scotland up
    to £96 million per year compared with the cost of nursing home places; further notes that
    many local authorities across Scotland have been forced to reduce services and increase
    costs for community care clients as a direct result of the Executive&#146;s latest local
    government financial settlement; further notes that many nursing and residential homes are
    facing severe financial pressure, due to decisions by councils to freeze fees for social
    work funded places despite cost increases; calls upon the Scottish Executive to unify
    health and social work budgets within Community Health Trusts involving NHS community
    services, social work services, the voluntary sector and the private sector, and believes
    that NHS resources wasted on blocked beds should be transferred to Health Trusts in order
    to provide more community care places and to deliver seamless and more effective community
    care services for clients.&quot;</p>
