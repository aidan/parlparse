          <p><strong> * S2M-2322 Richard Baker:Beating Bowel Cancer - 6th Loud Tie Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that approximately 3,500 Scots are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year and that it is the second most common cause of cancer death in Scotland with around 1,600 people dying from it each year; recognises that early detection can save lives&nbsp;and therefore<strong>&nbsp;</strong>welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to planning for the introduction of bowel cancer screening; recognises the importance of access to services and welcomes the improvements in staffing and equipment that have resulted from the Scottish Cancer Plan, <em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change</em>; supports awareness-raising campaigns like those in the west of Scotland and Lanarkshire and Forth Valley areas and urges the development of similar campaigns across Scotland; supports Beating Bowel Cancer&rsquo;s 6th Loud Tie Campaign and wishes the charity every success, and urges MSPs to help raise awareness of bowel cancer by wearing a loud tie or scarf. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2321 Alex Johnstone:1000th Anniversary of the Birth of Macbeth and Connections with Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2005 is the 1000th anniversary of the birth of Macbeth, King of Scotland from 1040 to 1057; regrets that Macbeth is misportrayed in the Shakespeare play of that name when in fact he was a successful Scottish King; notes the historic connections that Macbeth had with a number of locations in Scotland, including Lumphanan in Aberdeenshire, where he met his death at the Battle of Lumphanan in 1057, and is of the opinion that marking this 1000th anniversary would both boost understanding of this historic period and increase awareness, especially among tourists, of locations such as Lumphanan that have ties with Macbeth.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2320 Alex Johnstone:Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s renewable energy policy is unduly biased in favour of wind power to the detriment of other renewable technologies, which has led to widespread local opposition to wind farm developments throughout the country and to higher costs for electricity; furthermore agrees with Allan Wilson MSP, Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, that the concerns of security of supply and the need for emission reductions mean that it is time for an open-minded debate into the future of nuclear energy in Scotland; supports John Home Robertson MSP&rsquo;s proposal for a Cross Party Group on the civil nuclear industry, and calls on the Executive to work in partnership with the UK Government to create a long-term plan for Scotland&rsquo;s energy needs which balances renewable production with nuclear energy.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2319 Mr Tom McCabe:Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2318 Mr Tom McCabe:Local Government Finance ( Scotland) Order 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government Finance ( Scotland) Order 2005 (SSI 2005/19) be approved.</p>
          <p> Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2317# Nora Radcliffe:Responsible Deer Management</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the collaborative work on responsible deer management being undertaken in Scotland and the vital role of deer management groups and their use of the Deer Commission for Scotland&rsquo;s best practice guidance; acknowledges the importance of culling deer using such guidance to avoid poor condition of deer in late winter and unnecessary death by starvation or as a consequence of inadequate habitat and shelter to support them; notes the support of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in ensuring that culling is carried out professionally and humanely; recognises the contribution that sustainable deer management can make to sustaining rural development, with increased rural employment and public benefits such as habitat regeneration, enhanced biodiversity and reducing risk of road accidents; considers that deer management groups should take the issue forward constructively, implementing deer management planning and setting targets that can be monitored to ensure progress, and concludes that deer management groups should be supported by representation from wider public interests, including local community, recreational and conservation interests, which would be particularly useful during preparation and review of deer management plans.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2315 Mr Mark Ruskell:International Climate Change Taskforce</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Meeting the Climate Challenge</em>, the latest report of the International Climate Change Taskforce; notes with grave concern its conclusion that irreversible climate change will occur once atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations reach 400 parts per million (ppm); further notes that, with such concentrations currently at 379 ppm and rising at around 2 ppm per year, this limit is likely to be reached in around 10 years time, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to suspend all major projects that will undermine progress towards tackling climate change, such as the M74 extension, the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and the expansion of Glasgow International Airport.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2299# Dr Jean Turner:NHS Bed and Theatre Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the need to reduce waiting times and waiting lists safely; notes that, in order to help achieve this, the Scottish Executive should have more information than just what adequate numbers of trained NHS staff are required at all stages of the patient journey; therefore urges the Executive to identify how many hospital beds are necessary to cope, with ease, with the anticipated demands of emergency and elective workloads and the extra beds required, as stand-by, to maintain smooth working and thus prevent delays in admission for elective procedures due to lack of beds or staff; considers that the Executive should establish the number of surgical theatres necessary for special, general, elective and emergency procedures to allow surgeons access to a theatre without having to wait until one becomes free, and also considers that the Executive should establish how many high-dependency and intensive care beds are required to cope comfortably with the work of surgical theatres and wards in order that delays in admission for elective procedures will not occur due to lack of such beds and/or staff of any kind.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2298.2 John Swinburne:Older People</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2298) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &ldquo;, accepts that, despite these actions, there remains a growing problem of the ageing population demographic timebomb and believes that, without immediate, positive Executive action, many older people will continue to be adversely affected and die in this wealthy society in the 21 st century.&rdquo;</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2298.3 Mary Scanlon:Older People</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2298) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from second &ldquo;recognises&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;acknowledges that substantial progress needs to be made to meet the needs of older people which achieves a sustainable funding agreement to reduce bed-blocking and to end the inequality in funding between council-run homes and independent homes; calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that all elderly people assessed for free personal and nursing care are given the appropriate care in the environment which suits their needs, either at home or in residential care; acknowledges the central heating programme and free bus travel anywhere in Scotland; looks to the Executive to propose policy initiatives that benefit older people by promoting volunteering and lifelong learning and tackling anti-social behaviour, and calls on the Executive to build on these by recognising the diversity of older people and tackling ageism and encouraging the greater involvement of older people through the Older People&rsquo;s Consultative Forum, and in other ways, in the development of policy across the Scottish Executive.&rdquo;</p>
