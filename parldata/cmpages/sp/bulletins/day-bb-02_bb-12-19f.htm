the Proportional Representation (Local Government Elections) (Scotland) Bill.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3726#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Michael Matheson: Falkirk Community Stadium Project</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the important social and economic benefits of the Falkirk 
Community Stadium Project to Falkirk District; further notes with dismay the intransigence 
and lack of co-operation from Network Rail on this project, in attempting to hold 
the local community to ransom over access rights, and considers that Network Rail 
should recognise the important value that this development has to the local community 
and reconsider its position in favour of the local community.</P><P>Supported

Margo MacDonald: War with Iraq</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament, as the primary 
forum for the expression of opinion in Scotland, and with Scottish members of 
the armed forces now committed to preparations for aggressive military action 
against Iraq, declares its right to oppose war with Iraq without prior, specific 
approval for such action by the United Nations Security Council.</P><P>Supported

<STRONG>Margaret Smith: Mental Health (Scotland) Bill - Order of Consideration 
at Stage 2</STRONG>&#151;That the Health and Community Care Committee considers 
the Mental Health (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 in the following order: section 227,

230 and 231.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3723#</STRONG> <STRONG>Angus MacKay: Ethical Investment</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the work of Edinburgh University People and Planet group 
and the decision of the Edinburgh University Students&#146; Association to endorse 
overwhelmingly a motion on ethical investment during its general meeting; congratulates 
students that have chosen to highlight the issue on the university campus by campaigning 
that the University of Edinburgh&#146;s investments of £160 million should be 
invested only in ethical companies that do not flout human rights, exploit workers, 
pollute heavily or irresponsibly sell armaments; welcomes the decision of the 
University Court to make available previously confidential information about investments 
as a first step in achieving these aims but considers that the University of Edinburgh 
should go further by developing a fully accountable ethical investment policy, 
and believes that other universities in the United Kingdom should develop similar 
policies based on the shared values of their staff and students.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3718

ways to help and support these people; further notes that discussions are in progress 
between Scottish Executive health ministers and colleagues in Her Majesty's Government 
on the potential implications arising from the advice of the Expert Group on Financial

Care to return to the Health and Community Care Committee in January 2003 to report

insert at end &quot;but, in doing so, regrets that the provision in the bill of 
a right to buy for some tenants has already led to a significant reduction in 
the amount of land let under medium- and long-term arrangements, and believes 
that the enactment of such a provision will minimise land available for rent, 
including holdings under the new tenancies proposed in the bill, confining tenancies 
to those of a very short-term nature with a resultant negative impact on the management 
of the tenanted sector.&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Alex Johnstone<STRONG>*</STRONG>,
