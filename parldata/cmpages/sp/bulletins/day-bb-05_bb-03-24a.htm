          <p> 9.30 am Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
          <p> <em>followed by</em> Scottish National Party Debate: Firearms Legislation&mdash; </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2622 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Firearms Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern recent tragedies involving firearms and the continuing dangers in our communities posed by both real and replica guns; recognises that, notwithstanding action taken after the Dunblane tragedy in 1996, there are ongoing difficulties and gaps in the current legislation; calls, therefore, for powers over firearms to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament in view of the distinctive nature of our society, the distinct nature of the gun problem in Scotland and the urgent needs in our communities, and further calls for a new and all-encompassing Firearms Act to clarify what constitutes a firearm, who may possess a firearm, the circumstances under which people may acquire, keep and use firearms and all other aspects relating to firearms, including authorisation, monitoring and revocation. </p>
          <blockquote>

          <p><strong> 15. Robert Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to address the increasing number of needs-based referrals to children&rsquo;s panels. (S2O-5969) </p>
          <p> 3.00 pm Executive Debate: Life Sciences&mdash;</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2644 Mr Jim Wallace: Life Sciences</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the important role of life sciences in Scottish society and the contribution they make to economic prosperity, wealth creation and improving the health and quality of life of millions of people; believes that the sector harnesses Scotland&rsquo;s world-class scientific excellence and fosters greater entrepreneurial spirit; endorses the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s support to the sector, notably through successful, innovative initiatives such as the Scottish Co-investment Fund and the Life Sciences Intermediary Technology Institute; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to the Life Sciences Strategy, working in partnership with industry, academia, the investment community, NHS Scotland and all the other stakeholders to create a stable infrastructure in which the life sciences sector can flourish, and supports the firm intention to work in partnership to deliver the 15-year vision for 2020. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-2644.1 Jim Mather: Life Sciences</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2644) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &ldquo;endorses&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;and also recognises the need to root that spirit and its resultant wealth in Scotland by gaining the economic powers that will allow Scotland to produce an increasingly more competitive proposition, thereby retaining and attracting more investment and talented people and providing an environment that encourages the growth of indigenous and multi-national businesses in Scotland.&rdquo; </p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-2644.2 Murdo Fraser: Life Sciences</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2644) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &ldquo;endorses&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;notes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s support to the sector, notably through initiatives such as the Scottish Co-investment Fund and the Life Sciences Intermediary Technology Institute; regrets, however, that the Scottish Life Sciences Community Strategy failed to engage adequately with all sectors of the industry; notes the industry&rsquo;s very real concerns about bureaucracy, infrastructure and an appropriate skills base, and therefore calls on the Executive to supplement glossy brochures with tangible action to grow biosciences and encourage venture capitalist investment in Scotland by creating a more business-friendly environment.&rdquo; </p>
