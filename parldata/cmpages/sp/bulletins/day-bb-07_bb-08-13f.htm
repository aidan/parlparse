          <p><strong>*S3M-354</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>NACCO Material Handling Group Job Losses, Irvine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the end of production in January 2009 at NACCO Materials Handling Group&rsquo;s Irvine factory, with the loss of 220 jobs; recognises that NACCO has been a major employer in Irvine since 1957; acknowledges the highly skilled and loyal workforce at NACCO; welcomes the fact that there are contracts on the books which will ensure work for the factory for the next 18 months, and calls on the Scottish Executive to meet urgently with the appropriate agencies and the company to consider what can be done to ensure the retention of these 220 jobs in the local area after January 2009.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-353</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Closure of the Hyster Forklift Plant in Irvine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of the NACCO Materials Handling Group to begin a phased closure of its Hyster forklift plant in Irvine, with the loss of 220 jobs; is aware that this heavy blow to Scottish manufacturing from a company with a 50-year presence in Irvine follows on from the recent loss of over 400 jobs earlier in the year at the Simclar plants in Irvine and Kilwinning; commends ministers for immediately opening dialogue with NACCO and the workforce and ensuring that Scottish Development International and Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire follow suit; believes that concerted action has to be taken by the Scottish Government and agencies responsible to it, in conjunction with Westminster and North Ayrshire Council, not only to assist the workforce in finding alternative employment, but also in turning around the wider Ayrshire economy; considers the loss of over 14,200 manufacturing jobs, 47% of the total, in Ayrshire since 1997 to have contributed substantially to depopulation, currently predicted to reach 45,000 aged under 50 by 2024, and the economic decline of the county, with GDP per head having fallen from 75% to 67% of the Scottish average over that period, and agrees that, to ensure substantial improvement in the competitiveness of the Ayrshire economy in coming decades, substantial investment in infrastructure, together with reduced business burdens and taxation, a refocusing of the business support network, greater emphasis on education, skills and re-training, enhanced research and development, regeneration and improvement of the public realm are all absolutely essential.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-352</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Review of Court Procedure in Relation to Industrial Accidents</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the imminent implementation of legislation to create an offence of corporate manslaughter; recognises the further pain and heartache inflicted on the families of men and women killed or injured in industrial accidents through delays in court proceedings, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review the processes of the Scottish court system with the aim of removing all impediments and restraints on the swift and efficient administration of justice in relation to industrial accidents.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-351#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Care Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament raises serious concern at the ongoing dispute over pay and grading which has led to 600 care workers in Glasgow being on indefinite strike; believes that this situation has arisen as a direct result of the failings of both the previous Scottish Executive administration and local councils to tackle the issue of equal pay and single status, leading to a situation where workers are seeing their salaries being cut by means of downgrading the pay structure many workers were attached to in order to meet the council&rsquo;s liabilities under the Equal Pay Act; further notes that at the parliamentary debate on equal pay on 9 November 2006 the previous administration failed to take any action despite the recommendations of the Finance Committee which concluded that &quot;The Committee believes that the implementation of Single Status and retrospective compensatory payments is the biggest financial challenge that local government in Scotland has faced. The Committee further believes that there is no reason why, in the interests of employees, council taxpayers and service users, this issue cannot be resolved within 12 months. The Committee calls on the councils, unions and COSLA to enter urgently into discussions at local and national level, facilitated by the Executive where necessary, to ensure implementation within this timescale and to consider what lessons must be learned from the failure to progress agreement on Single Status&quot; in its <em>Report on the Financial Implications of the Local Authority Single Status Agreement</em>, and considers that appropriate representations should be made to Glasgow City Council in order to resolve this situation at soon as possible to safeguard the wellbeing of the people who social care workers care for, by protecting vulnerable children, ensuring that older people live at home safely, assisting people with learning disabilities, rehabilitating those with an addiction, providing guidance and monitoring for those in the criminal and youth justice system and much more.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-350</strong> <strong>Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>Scottish Football Museum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to note the increasing popularity of the Scottish Football Museum at Hampden Park, Glasgow, which has the world&rsquo;s most impressive collection of football memorabilia, including the world&rsquo;s oldest international cap, the world&rsquo;s oldest national trophy and the world&rsquo;s oldest world championship trophy, and further notes and supports the museum&rsquo;s application for acknowledgment and funding from the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Museum Recognition Scheme.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-349</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Young People of Operation Phoenix</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the young people of Greater Easterhouse who participated in Operation Phoenix, a programme of adventure and activity launched by Strathclyde Police E Division and their partners, Glasgow City Council, Gladiators, FARE and Pavillion, supported by Communities Scotland and with artwork designed by a talented young local artist, James Wylie, and notes that this initiative helped reduce disorder and provide a safe environment for young people to get involved in their local community.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-348</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Macmillan Cancer Support</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Macmillan Cancer Support on the success of its Mobile Macmillan Cancer Information Centre which visited Glasgow on 23 and 24 July as part of the seventh year of its UK tour, running from March to November 2007; notes that the centre had over 6,500 visitors last year and looks forward to even greater success this year; further notes that Macmillan also runs a cancer telephone helpline, a youth cancer line and a south Asian language cancer helpline; welcomes the work of Macmillan Cancer Support in providing supportive information to people across the United Kingdom, in raising awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer and in providing high quality advice, information and support to people affected by cancer, and looks forward to continued progress in improving support and care for cancer patients and their families and carers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-347#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Maintenance of Common Land on Scottish Housing Estates</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the many complaints voiced by people throughout Scotland over the neglect of common land on their housing estates, such as Gryffe Castle in Bridge of Weir and Inch Meadows/Roseland Brae in Erskine, even although some residents pay upwards of &pound;400 per annum for the maintenance of such areas of land adjacent to their homes; notes that many of these complainers accuse the Greenbelt Group, in particular, of failing to honour its obligations to householders in relation to the company&rsquo;s maintenance of local common land; is of the view that this company and others engaged in this service should aim for the very best standards of performance, which is a legitimate demand made by householders, and, in addition to the enhancement of these maintenance standards, firmly believes in the examination of alternative management procedures and practices, such as the common hold system, which would enable the community of householders to be given more control of the common land surrounding or adjacent to their homes.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-345#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Asylum Seekers in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes discussions between the Scottish and UK governments aimed at tackling the situation of asylum seekers in Scotland and to this end supports calls for asylum seekers to be granted the right to work whilst seeking asylum, which has been backed by Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Refugee Council which comments that &quot;It just makes absolutely no sense to have people sitting at home in enforced idleness when they could be contributing to the economy&quot;, and further believes that an amnesty for asylum seeker families who have been in Scotland since before March 2006 would be one which rightly acknowledges that in Glasgow these families have become a valued part of the local community and the vast difference between the situation in Scotland, where roughly 1,500 families would be granted asylum, compared to over 400,000 in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-343</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>NL Kidz</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the success of the first NL Kidz event which promoted personal safety, health and security to almost 4,000 young people across North Lanarkshire in Strathclyde Country Park earlier this year, a partnership event delivered through the North Lanarkshire Community Safety Partnership; congratulates the project on the publication of its first report, the NL Kidz annual report, which was published during July and shows that many of these young people are retaining the vital messages delivered through NL Kidz, and looks forward to the continuing success of the project in coming years.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-342</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>New North Lanarkshire Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes and looks forward to the opening of the new schools in North Lanarkshire of St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary in Kilsyth, St Ignatius and Wishaw Academy Primary Joint Campus and Cambusnethan Primary in Wishaw, bringing fantastic facilities and benefits to more than 1,000 pupils across North Lanarkshire; recognises that, when the schools open their doors for the first time, this will bring the total number of schools opened under the first phase of Education 2010 to fifteen in the North Lanarkshire area; recognises that work on all the remaining projects is now underway and that this is a major milestone for Education 2010, and, as planning for phase 2 of Education 2010 progresses, welcomes the commitment of North Lanarkshire Council to improving the school estate throughout North Lanarkshire and providing our pupils, staff and communities with major community assets that can be enjoyed by all.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-341#</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Adopt a Road</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to consider introducing the Adopt a Road initiative which works so successfully in Canada; notes that under such a scheme individuals, companies and voluntary groups take responsibility for a length of road, usually in the vicinity of the sponsoring group or person, from one junction to the next; is aware that, while no money changes hands, the sponsor agrees to keep the sponsored road free of litter and reasonably clean, contacting their local authority to uplift any refuse gathered having given at least 24 hours notice; notes that the scheme recognises sponsors through the provision of signs on the sponsored road designed, provided and erected by their local authority, and believes that such a scheme could be successfully piloted in Cunninghame North.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-339</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Action Against Fuel Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the fall in the number of fuel-poor households from 36% in 1996 to 15% in 2004 and the subsequent rise to 18% in the following year; expresses its support for the campaign of Energy Action Scotland to secure improved insulation, extend the use of microrenewables and encourage the power companies to expand their social tariffs, and calls on the Scottish Executive to pursue these and other initiatives aimed at further reducing fuel poverty.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-338#</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Warm Zones</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the excellent work of not-for-profit Warm Zones Ltd, set up with UK Government support in 2000 and operated by National Energy Action, the leading fuel poverty charity in England and Wales, working in partnership with local government, energy companies such as Transco and British Gas, European Union agencies and others; is aware that the Warm Zone project encourages a proactive approach to combating fuel poverty by going into communities to assess the energy efficiency and fuel poverty status of all households in an entire area, with a view to co-ordinating the free delivery of necessary energy efficiency improvements and related services; appreciates that the Warm Zone all area approach has been effective in reaching vulnerable households which often do not apply for available fuel benefits or grants; believes that, while so far warm zones have only been set up in England and Wales, Scotland with some 384,000 households, one in six, in fuel poverty can learn from the successes achieved south of the border; appreciates that in Gateshead alone warm zones invested &pound;2 million and warm zone teams visited 26,239 homes, carried out 21,067 assessments, surveyed 13,384 homes, installed energy efficiency measures in 9,996 homes and attracted &pound;400,000 extra in benefits for residents in the year to February 2007, attracting &pound;200,000 in European structural funding for job creation and training while reducing energy usage by an average of 40% and attaining a client satisfaction rating of over 97%, and concludes that an area like North Ayrshire, with an estimated 11,000 of 62,000 households in fuel poverty, would be an excellent place to undertake a warm zone project and ultimately supports the introduction of warm zones across Scotland, believing that the Scottish Government should discuss with local authorities, Energy Action Scotland and other stakeholders the establishment of warm zones north of the border as part of a concerted and systematic campaign to eradicate fuel poverty once and for all.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-327</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Saltire for Scotland&rsquo;s Capital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the comments by the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture that the Scottish Government should have responsibility for all guidance related to the flying of national flags in Scotland; notes that Edinburgh Castle, one of Scotland&rsquo;s premier tourist attractions, continues to fly the Union Flag in a superior position despite the castle being owned by Scottish Ministers and operated by Historic Scotland, an agency of the Scottish Government; notes the existing guidance to all Scottish non-departmental public bodies and agencies that the Saltire should fly prominently from all public buildings, and urges Historic Scotland to ensure that the Saltire, the oldest national flag in Europe, is restored to its rightful place on the principal flagstaff on Edinburgh Castle.</p>
