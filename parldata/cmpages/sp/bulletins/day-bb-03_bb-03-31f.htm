          <p><strong>S1M-4071</strong> <strong>Angus MacKay: USDAW's Campaign 
            to Protect Shopworkers Against Violence and Abuse</strong>-That the 
            Parliament is appalled at the number of incidents of violent attacks 
            on, and abuse of, shopworkers, as reported in the Scottish Retail 
            Consortium's Annual Crime Survey; notes with concern that last year 
            over 31% of shops in Scotland had at least one reported incident of 
            violence against a shopworker; further notes with concern that a survey 
            conducted by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) 
            revealed that over the last 12 months 47% of shopworkers had suffered 
            physical violence, 72% had been threatened and 86% had been verbally 
            abused; calls upon members of the Scottish Parliament to support USDAW's 
            <em>Freedom from Fear</em> campaign against violence and abuse of 
            shopworkers, and urges the Scottish Executive to make retail crime 
            a police key performance indicator and promote and resource town centre 
            and safer shopping partnerships.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-4070</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Scottish Settlement 
            for Fire Dispute</strong>-That the Parliament notes the decision of 
            Her Majesty's Government to introduce a Fire Services Bill that will 
            impose a pay and conditions settlement on fire services staff in England 
            and Wales; recognises that by this action Her Majesty's Government 
            has effectively abandoned the United Kingdom negotiating mechanism, 
            and calls upon the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the 
            Fire Brigades Union in Scotland to enter into negotiations to secure 
            a fair and just settlement that can be presented to the incoming Scottish 
            Executive.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-4069</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Chapelcross - The 
            World's Oldest Operational Nuclear Power Station</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes that the Chapelcross Power Station will, from the 
            start of April, be the longest serving nuclear power station in the 
            world; further notes that Chapelcross has provided a safe and reliable 
            supply of electricity to the south of Scotland since 1959 and regrets 
            that it will cease generation no later than 31 March 2005; believes 
            that the engineering and scientific accomplishments of designing, 
            building and operating Chapelcross and Calder Hall were the 20th century 
            equivalent of the Forth Rail Bridge or the invention of the steam 
            engine and congratulates the management and workforce on their skill 
            and dedication in operating successfully the Calder Hall and Chapelcross 
            power stations for a combined total of more than 90 years; further 
            notes the fudge and delay inherent in the Government's energy white 
            paper, and believes that the success of Chapelcross would be best 
            recognised by the early commissioning of a replacement nuclear power 
            facility on the same site.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4068</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Paisley Law 
            Centre</strong>-That the Parliament commends the hard work of the 
            staff of the Paisley Law Centre, notes that at the end of December, 
            Paisley Law Centre was carrying a caseload of 489 open client files; 
            further notes that 47% of its client caseload during this period was 
            people facing eviction, 22% was involved in other miscellaneous house 
            disputes, 17% related to social security, mental health, community 
            care, criminal injuries and disability matters, 7% was involved in 
            disputes involving their employment and 5% related to assisting voluntary 
            organisations; believes that Paisley Law Centre offers a quality service 
            giving clients a high chance of achieving a successful resolution 
            to their problem and significantly helps in preventing homelessness 
            and tackling social exclusion and that many of its clients have children 
            living with them in their tenancies or are vulnerable due to ill health 
            or other reasons and a significant number would no doubt have been 
            evicted had they had no representation; supports the work of local 
            law centres, which provide such essential services to our communities, 
            and urges support for their development across Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4067</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Paisley, Scotlands 
            Largest Fairtrade Town</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Fairtrade 
            Fortnight 2003 from 3 to 17<sup> </sup>March 2003 was widely observed 
            in Scotland and welcomes the growing support for this annual observance; 
            congratulates the town of Paisley on meeting the five criteria laid 
            down by the Fairtrade Foundation for the holding of Fairtrade town 
            status, understanding that the five tests successfully met by Paisley 
            are a resolution from the local council supporting Fairtrade and an 
            agreement to serve Fairtrade coffee and tea at its meetings, in its 
            offices and canteens, a range of Fairtrade products readily available 
            in the area's shops and served in at least two local cafes, Fairtrade 
            products in use by at least 10 local businesses and organisations 
            including churches, media coverage and popular support and a local 
            Fairtrade steering group to ensure continued commitment to the Fairtrade 
            town status ideal; recognises that this status will establish Paisley 
            as the largest Fairtrade town in Scotland and acknowledges with appreciation 
            the work Renfrewshire Council, the ecumenical effort of the churches 
            in the area, the support of local newspapers and local radio stations, 
            the willingness of many Paisley people to make fair trade a priority 
            and the campaigning of local politicians to this end; believes that 
            Fairtrade products have a key role in raising awareness of significant 
            global issues among consumers and their families, and encourages other 
            towns to follow where Paisley leads.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4066</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: Dr Winnie Ewing

            the work of Dr Winnie Ewing in the Parliaments of Scotland, Westminster 
            and Europe; recognises her unstinting work on behalf of all the peoples 
            of Scotland; recalls the dignity with which she opened the first Scottish 
            Parliament in 1999, and wishes her every happiness in her retirement 
            from public life, but anticipates that she will not relent from her

            pride in, the staff of the Parliament who have been an example of 
            shining endeavour to all in making the Parliament work; is mindful 
            that they, more than politicians, created the Parliament from scratch 
            and adopted an upbeat and helpful attitude that is not present to 
            such a degree in all Parliaments; notes that the staff undertook two 
            big "flits", to Glasgow and to Aberdeen, the burden of which was borne 
            with grace; believes that every single office, clerking, Official

            in respect of the requirements of disabled citizens when they visit 
            polling stations to cast their votes but believes that much more needs 
            to be done by the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government, 
            in consultation with the Royal National Institute of the Blind, in 
            order to ensure that visually-impaired voters can be truly confident

          <p> <strong>S1M-4060</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Edinburgh Royal 
            Infirmary Parking Charges</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern that, as from mid-April, staff at the new Edinburgh Royal 
            Infirmary will be either paying £250 per annum for a parking permit 
            if they have been successful in their application or paying £10 per 
            day Monday to Friday and £3 per day at weekends; believes that there 
            has been an over-issue of permits; notes that using public transport 
            may be staff's only option and that, for a theatre staff nurse living 
            in Penicuik and working an 11-hour shift from 7.30am to 6.30pm, this 
            will mean leaving home at 6.20am, changing bus with a three-minute 
            transfer time, in order to arrive at work in time to begin the shift, 
            assuming that all buses run to time; refers to the answer to written 
            question S1W-27065 on 16 July 2002 that stated that a review of car 
            parking charges was to be undertaken; calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to publish results of that review as a matter of urgency, and expresses 
            concern that hospital staff on shifts, with modest income and working 
            in essential medical services, are being charged in this manner. </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4059</strong> <strong>George Lyon: Over Thirty Months

            deep concerns and anger over the Department for Environment, Food 
            and Rural Affairs' proposal to cut the compensation to them for animals 
            slaughtered under the Over Thirty Months Scheme; further notes that 
            this cut is for apparent financial reasons prior to the completion 
            of the Food Standards Agency's review of the scheme, and calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to press for a delay in the cuts until the 
            Food Standards Agency's consultation on changes to the scheme is completed 
            and a proper strategy put in place for the gradual withdrawal of the 
            scheme causing minimum disruption to the market place. </p>

            including her long battle for 500,000 people in Scotland with chronic 
            pain, her pioneering win in Europe of a landmark pollution case to 
            protect Glasgow, her example in turning out to help constituents during 
            every crisis, from East End flooding to protecting Govanhill pool 
            protesters against a police horse charge, her exposure of injustice 
            to the villagers of Blairingone in a scholarly parliamentary report
