         <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2519</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Muslims Targeted by Anti-Terror Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the remarks of the Home Office minister, Hazel Blears, to the Home Affairs Select&nbsp;Committee, and widely reported in the press, in relation to counter-terrorism powers that &quot;some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the Muslim community&quot; and that &quot;the threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of Islam&quot;; regards these remarks as directly associating our Muslim communities with terrorism; believes that&nbsp;they will be used by racists and far-right thugs as a green light to attack Muslims and will result in an increase in racist attacks; believes that the targeting of Muslims by the security services will be done on a racist basis and abhors the fact that a Labour government elected with the support of substantial sections of&nbsp;Muslim communities should now be targeting those communities as if they were&nbsp;&quot;the enemy within&quot;, and&nbsp;further notes that the last terrorist outrage committed in the United Kingdom was by a far-right racist against the lesbian and gay community.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2518</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Publication of Scotland 2020</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Scotland 2020</em> by Demos and the Scottish Book Trust; notes that the authors conclude that national pessimism and negativity is stifling Scotland; notes chapter 21 that highlights the inadequacy of GDP as a measure of a nation&rsquo;s progress and outlines the damage caused by the &quot;obsession&quot; with GDP and &quot;growth fetishism&quot;; acknowledges that economic growth alone cannot create the optimum conditions for a thriving and sustainable Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive to adopt alternatives to GDP that will strengthen civil society, social well-being and active citizenship.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2517</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>SCIAF 40th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (SCIAF) on its 40th anniversary; expresses admiration for its work with poor communities across the world and particularly in Africa, Asia and Latin America; acknowledges the generosity and commitment of the people of Scotland to SCIAF throughout this time; notes that two billion people in the world still live in dire poverty, and encourages SCIAF to continue its work with ever-greater urgency and dedication.</p>
