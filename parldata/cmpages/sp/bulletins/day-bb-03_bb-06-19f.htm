          <P><strong>*S2M-174#</strong> <strong>John Scott: Paediatric Services 
            in Ayrshire</strong>-That the Parliament notes the considerable concern 
            in Ayrshire regarding the current review of paediatric services in 
            the area; hopes that this review will be brought to a speedy conclusion, 
            and further notes that there is a clear wish on the part of local 
            people for the retention of the two paediatric units at Ayr and Crosshouse 
            hospitals.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-173#</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Ending Alcohol 
            Ban at Sports Grounds</strong>-That the Parliament notes the ban on 
            the sale of alcohol at Murrayfield Stadium and at football grounds 
            as a result of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980; recognises 
            that this ban was a necessary response to disorderly behaviour at 
            football grounds at that time; further recognises, however, that, 
            as behaviour has improved as a result of the introduction of seated 
            stadia and improved crowd control, this ban has served its purpose 
            and is now having a detrimental effect on the finances of football 
            clubs and Scottish rugby, and therefore believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should lift the ban at Murrayfield and all fully-seated 
            football grounds as part of a liberalisation of licensing law.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-172</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: BBC Frontline Scotland 
            Programme "Stop Chewing the Fat"</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the BBC Frontline Scotland on the excellent programme broadcast on 
            17 June 2003, &quot;Stop Chewing the Fat&quot;; notes that the programme 
            makes a strong case for free, nutritionally balanced school meals 
            in Scotland, based on evidence from Finland, where such meals have 
            been a central part of their successful campaign to improve the nation's 
            health and have resulted in a 65% reduction in rate of coronary heart 
            disease; notes that 11 of the 12 members of the Scottish Executive's 
            advisory committee on healthy eating approached by the programme favour 
            the idea of free school meals, and informs MSPs that this programme 
            will be shown in committee room 2 at 10:30 am on 24 June 2003 as part 
            of the launch of the free school meals bill to be introduced by Rosie 
            Kane.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-171</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle: Anonymous Electoral 
            Registration</strong>-That the Parliament notes that, since motion 
            S2M-91 on electoral registration and victims of domestic abuse was 
            lodged, the Electoral Commission has published a report, <em>The Electoral 
            Register Process</em>, which recommends that anonymous registration 
            be introduced for electors who are able to demonstrate that there 
            is a genuine threat to their safety; welcomes the acknowledgement 
            that victims of domestic abuse can be placed at risk if their name 
            appears on the electoral register; further notes that the report has 
            been submitted to the Deputy Prime Minister, and urges Her Majesty's 
            Government to introduce legislative changes as soon as possible to 
            allow the earliest benefit from this proposed anonymous registration 
            process.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-170 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Membership of Committee</strong>-That the Parliament agrees 
            that Mrs Margaret Smith be appointed a member of the Equal Opportunities 
            Committee. </P>
          <P>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-169 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Approval of SSI</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the 
            Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) 
            (Orkney) (Scotland) Order 2003 (SSI 2003/260) be approved. </P>
          <P>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-168 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Approval of SSI</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the 
            draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2003 Amendment Order 2003 be approved. 
          </P>
          <P>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-168.1</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Approval of SSI</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-168) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, 
            insert at end "but, in so doing, regrets that the Scottish Executive 
            has made the request for additional resources in a manner that does 
            not provide the Parliament with the opportunity of having a separate 
            and distinct vote on the proposed extra cash for the Holyrood building 
            project."</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-167</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Escalating Costs 
            of the Parliament Building</strong>-That the Parliament calls for 
            the inquiry into the escalating costs of the new Parliament building 
            to identify both the politicians and senior public servants responsible 
            for the current crisis; believes that those responsible should be 
            required to resign or be disciplined, including the relevant finance 
            ministers who approved the increased costs; further calls for the 
            bill for the new Parliament building to be sent to Her Majesty's Government, 
            where the original decision and flawed contract was decided, and believes 
            that the people of Scotland should not see their essential public 
            services cut to pay for this white elephant.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-166#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Macmillan/CAB 
            Cancer Patient Services</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Macmillan Cancer Relief and the citizens advice bureaux of Lanarkshire 
            on the innovative service that they have developed for cancer patients, 
            providing debt assistance, employment, housing and other benefits 
            to cancer patients and their carers; recognises that this is an excellent 
            example of effective partnership working between voluntary organisations; 
            commends Macmillan Cancer Relief and Airdrie Citizens Advice Bureau 
            on the success of the pilot project in Airdrie; wishes them well as 
            the project is rolled out across Lanarkshire, and recognises the benefits 
            that such a service could provide across Scotland.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-165</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Mis-selling 
            of Gas and Electricity</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent 
            survey by the Trading Standards Institute that revealed that as many 
            as 1.4 milion households in the UK have suffered bad experiences from 
            energy salespeople; further notes that energy companies such as Scottish 
            Gas have taken over people's accounts without their permission; believes 
            that mis-selling of gas and electricity is unacceptable, and supports 
            Energywatch's "Stop Now" campaign, which aims to restore consumer 
            confidence by condemning high-pressure doorstep sales.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, 
            Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Richard 
            Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, Jim Mather<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenny 
            MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Michael Matheson<strong>*</strong>, Patrick 
            Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-164</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Ferguson's Shipyard, 
            Port Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament is of the view that Ferguson's 
            Shipyard, Port Glasgow, is one of the very best shipyards in Europe 
            and believes that it is of the utmost importance, for both the economy 
            of the lower Clyde and the Scottish shipbuilding industry, that the 
            Scottish Executive does all in its power to ensure that the management 
            and workforce at the yard are given every encouragement to bid for 
            orders that, going by the yard's excellent record, would be built 
            on time, to cost and to the highest levels of quality of design and 
            construction.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-163</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson: Heartstart Ayrshire 
            and Arran</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Heartstart Ayrshire 
            and Arran on training 21,000 members of the public in emergency life 
            support since its inception in 1995; commends the dedication of the 
            volunteer instructors, and welcomes the British Heart Foundation's 
            schools initiative, enabling young people from 11 schools in Ayrshire 
            and Arran to be trained in emergency life support and 69 teachers 
            to be trained as instructors.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-162.1</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird: Water Industry</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-162) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave 
            out from first "notes" to end and insert "recognises that the supply 
            of clean water is a fundamental human right and therefore must remain 
            in public ownership; acknowledges that the water industry in Scotland 
            has suffered from chronic underinvestment and that comparisons with 
            the privatised water industry in England and Wales are meaningless, 
            and calls for an end to the gradual privatisation of the water industry 
            through the continued use of expensive private finance initiative 
            and public private partnership schemes.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-162.2</strong> <strong>Frances Curran: Water Industry</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-162) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave 
            out from "to businesses" and insert "and believes that these charges 
            bear disproportionately on domestic and small business customers rather 
            than big business customers; calls on the Scottish Executive to investigate 
            models of social ownership that would incorporate democratic accountability 
            and a transfer of the burden of charges from domestic to business 
            customers on a sliding scale basis and to initiate a review of the 
            role of the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland; calls for Scottish 
            Water to be allowed to borrow from the European Investment Bank, and 
            further calls for the debt previously owed by the three water authorities 
            to be written off by Her Majesty's Government, as happened in England 
            and Wales in 1996."</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-162.3</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson: Water Industry</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-162) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave 
            out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes 
            that, having established Scottish Water in 2002, this is the right 
            means of delivering cost-effective and improved services in accordance 
            with the requirements of the Parliament and that, in the short time 
            since Scottish Water's establishment, it has started the process of 
            delivering cost effective and improved services, and further believes 
            that a review of its ownership and funding now would undermine that 
            progress to the detriment of all customers." </P>
          <P>Supported by: Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-162.4</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Water Industry</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-162) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave 
            out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "believes that the offices 
            of the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland and the Water Quality 
            Regulator should be amalgamated to create a tough new champion on 
            behalf of customers; further believes that a full and detailed review 
            of the financial control arrangements for Scottish Water requires 
            to be undertaken as a matter of urgency with a view to affording Scottish 
            Water greater financial flexibility, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to consider a not-for-profit trust to provide an appropriate vehicle 
            for investment which would allow Scottish Water to be free of artificial 
            constraints and keep charges under control."</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-161.1</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Care Homes

            "regrets that the present funding levels to the voluntary and private 
            sectors leave vulnerable older people exposed to disruption and distress

            believes that the Executive should undertake an urgent review of funding 
            for the care home sector based on an analysis of the true cost of 
            care, and calls on the Executive to carry out an urgent review of

            on the Scottish Executive to undertake a review into its funding for 
            such homes and to recognise that health and social care are a basic 
            right and, as such, should be provided and funded by the public sector.&quot;</P>

            home fees which resulted in an extra investment of over £130 million 
            in the care home sector since July 2001; welcomes the work currently

            a framework for assessing the cost of providing care for older people 
            from 2005-06, and notes the continuing commitment of the Executive 
            to shift the balance of care from institutional settings to providing 
            care at home and its setting up of the national care standards which 
            provide a quality framework.&quot; </P>
