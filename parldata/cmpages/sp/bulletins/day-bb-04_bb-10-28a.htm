          <p>9.30 am&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Executive Debate on Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland&rsquo;s Housing&mdash;</p>
          <p><strong><a name="a"></a>S2M-1898</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland&rsquo;s Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to a 30% increase in affordable housing provision by 2007-08 in order to increase the availability of social rented accommodation for homeless people, reduce pressure on waiting lists and help first-time buyers on to the housing ladder; welcomes the introduction of the Housing Quality Standard and the improvements in housing quality that are resulting from substantial community ownership and fuel poverty programmes; recognises the major achievements flowing from devolution for housing in Scotland, such as a modernised and single tenancy in the social rented sector, progressive homelessness legislation and the development of tenant participation and rights, and looks forward to the forthcoming Housing Bill which will raise standards in the private housing sector and strengthen the rights of private sector tenants. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S2M-1898.1</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland&rsquo;s Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1898) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that it is a basic human right to have the comfort, security and stability of a warm affordable home and that decent suitable housing is crucial to the individual&rsquo;s quality of life, whether young or old, and crucial to healthy, thriving communities and the economy at large; notes that, after five years of the Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition, homelessness has increased substantially and that the right to buy has seriously damaged the socially rented sector; therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to revisit its right to buy policy, to utilise the proposed planning and housing legislation to facilitate the provision of affordable housing and to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s people have access to the homes they deserve across tenures and that the scourge of rooflessness, bed and breakfast and &quot;sofa surfing&quot; is consigned to history.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1898.2</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland&rsquo;s Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1898) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that housing stock transfer to community-based housing associations, a policy introduced by the Conservatives, gives tenants greater rights, responsibilities and input into the way their housing is run; believes that, to improve the standard of public housing for everyone, it is necessary to step up the process of devolving control of housing from local authorities to local community groups; further believes that, to improve the standard and supply of private housing for rent or purchase, a review and modernisation of the Scottish planning system is required to simplify and speed up the development process, and notes with concern the restraint on new housing construction currently imposed in Scotland by the inadequacies of Scottish Water&rsquo;s sewerage network.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1898.4</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie: Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland&rsquo;s Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1898) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to increase affordable housing provision and the beneficial consequences that this will have for a range of people in Scotland; notes that the welcome increases in the provision of new affordable housing may be offset by a loss of affordable housing stock through the right to buy; requests that the Executive&rsquo;s review of right to buy in 2006 under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 is informed by an open and comprehensive consultation on future options for right to buy; recognises the Executive&rsquo;s efforts to improve standards in housing quality, especially with the introduction of the housing quality standard, fuel poverty programmes and the forthcoming Housing Bill; further recognises the contribution that poor quality housing and lack of environmental awareness in housing design make to Scotland&rsquo;s disproportionate ecological footprint and number of winter deaths; supports WWF Scotland in its call for the Executive to set a target for 10,000 new or refurbished sustainable homes by 2012; believes, therefore, that whilst there have been notable achievements flowing from devolution for housing in Scotland, many challenges lie ahead, and calls on the Executive to report at appropriate intervals on its progress on improving the quality and availability of housing.&quot; </p>

          <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S2M-1899.1</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Making the Most of Scotland&rsquo;s Forests</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1899) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, insert at end &quot;; further believes that increased emphasis should be placed on the principal economic concerns of the industry; calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce a specific target to promote the use of forestry for biomass; believes in the objective of a greater mix of public, community and private ownership of forestry, and urges ministers to take further steps to promote the use of timber in the construction industry.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1899.2</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Making the Most of Scotland&rsquo;s Forests</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1899) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, insert at end &quot;notes, however, that new planting is at an all-time low, that Forestry Commission Scotland and Forest Enterprise Scotland are budgeted to receive &pound;80 million in the next financial year from the taxpayer with the consequential competitive disadvantage to the private sector and that the promised Executive statement on the link between the agricultural and forestry industries following the introduction of the single farm payment has still not been made, and believes that these factors demonstrate that the Executive betrays a lack of understanding of the importance of the private sector to Scotland&rsquo;s forestry industry.&quot; </p>
