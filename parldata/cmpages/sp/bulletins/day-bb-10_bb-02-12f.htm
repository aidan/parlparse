                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5762 Jackie Baillie: New Chapter for Vale of Leven Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Vale of Leven Academy on the official opening of its new school on 9 November 2009; welcomes the fact that old boy and former Bishop of Edinburgh, the Rev Richard Holloway, performed the opening ceremony; notes that 2009 was the 100th anniversary of the school&rsquo;s name; recognises that the new Vale of Leven Academy has modern classrooms with interactive technology and the very latest sports facilities; further notes that the new school was commissioned by the previous Labour administration in West Dunbartonshire Council with funding allocated by the former Labour-led Scottish Executive, and looks forward to many generations to come being educated in a new, modern, 21st century school.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5761 Jackie Baillie: Lomond Gateway to Investment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the positive economic impact that the Lomondgate has had in Dumbarton; understands that &pound;91 million has been generated for Dumbarton&rsquo;s economy since its development; further understands that Lomondgate is expected to deliver a total of &pound;450 million into the area&rsquo;s economy and 1,400 extra jobs by 2019; acknowledges that the Strathleven Regeneration Company, in partnership with the developer, the Walker Group, plans to provide 300 new homes, leisure and retail facilities and a business park, and congratulates all involved in the success of Lomondgate, which already houses the production facility for BBC Scotland&rsquo;s <em>River City</em> and will soon house the new plant for power giant Aggreko.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5760 Ken Macintosh: Quarriers and the Young People&rsquo;s Charter</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the charity, Quarriers, on the launch of its Young People&rsquo;s Charter; notes that the charter aims to ensure that all young homeless and vulnerable people are helped to achieve their full potential and that they have a successful transition into adulthood; recognises the plight of the thousands of homeless young people in Scotland; congratulates Quarriers on its hard work and its ongoing efforts to improve the lives of vulnerable people, and asks that all MSPs fully support the campaign to improve life for the homeless and vulnerable young people in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5759 Nigel Don: 450th Anniversary of the Reformation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the World Reformed Fellowship conference in Edinburgh; notes that 2010 marks the 450th anniversary of the reformation in Scotland; considers that the reformers&rsquo; passion for opening up the scriptures to all Scots led to a drive towards improved literacy and that within one hundred years schools were established in parishes across Scotland; further considers that the reformers&rsquo; emphasis on free thinking and an individual&rsquo;s relationship with God arguably helped pave the way for the enquiry, investigation and freedom of conscience associated with the Scottish enlightenment, and therefore pays tribute to the men and women of the reformation for their contribution in laying the foundations of modern Scottish society.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5758 Kenneth Gibson: Alcohol Pricing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the implementation of policy establishing minimum pricing requirements for a unit of alcohol would correlate with the alleviation of alcohol-related problems and the promotion of a healthier nation; considers that overwhelming evidence from academic and first-hand sources, most recently from Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems, confirms that there is a strong linkage between the price of alcohol and consumption; further considers that controls on the price and availability of alcohol are recognised as two of the most effective methods for limiting alcohol-related problems, and further believes that failure to execute changes, by, for example, kicking the issue into touch by way of an alcohol commission, signifies a refusal to acknowledge that alcohol is one of Scotland&rsquo;s big three killers and that an estimated &pound;2.25 billion is lost annually from the Scottish economy due to alcohol.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5757 Mr Frank McAveety: Possibilities for East End Kids</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the continuing success of Possibilities for East End Kids (PEEK), which provides a range of activities to children and young people in the inner east end of Glasgow; welcomes the award of a grant of &pound;202,000 from Go Play Scotland to expand play provision for children aged five to 13, and looks forward to the development of further strategies to enable PEEK to enhance its range of activities that have been so beneficial to the wider community.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5756 Cathy Peattie: Dick Gaughan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dick Gaughan on his Lifetime Achievement Award presented at this year&rsquo;s BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards; notes that this follows his recent induction into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame; believes that, as songwriter, performer and social commentator, Dick Gaughan exemplifies the best of Scottish culture, and hopes that these awards will lead to further success and recognition of his talents and also will help to promote and encourage support for the living tradition of Scotland&rsquo;s folk music and arts.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5754 Mr Frank McAveety: Haggeye in the Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament was pleased to welcome the presence in the Parliament last week of Haggeye, the forum for blind and partially sighted young people in Scotland, as part of the Community Partnerships Project, which also involved Multi Ethnic Aberdeen Ltd and Action For Children; congratulates Haggeye on its enthusiastic engagement with the project through an ongoing campaign to raise awareness of important issues for blind and partially sighted young people in Scotland, most recently by promoting RNIB Scotland&rsquo;s What Would You Lose campaign in the Parliament, and calls on parliamentarians to continue to show support for initiatives such as Haggeye.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5753 Bob Doris: Partick Thistle and Phoenix Futures Graduation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the participants of the Handyperson Project, a partnership between Phoenix Futures drug rehabilitation and Partick Thistle Football Club (PTFC) community initiative programme; notes that the scheme benefits PTFC by helping with a variety of manual jobs at Firhill stadium while the participants gain valuable skills and work experience; welcomes the first graduation from the programme on Tuesday 9 February 2010; recognises the great courage and commitment from participants as they recover from past addiction, and wishes them the best of health and happiness as they look forward to a future free from drugs.</p>

                                        <p> <strong>*S3M-5752 Robert Brown: End the Tax on Breathing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the End the Tax on Breathing campaign initiated by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association UK; supports the campaign&rsquo;s objective to end the discrimination facing 90,000 people in Scotland and across the United Kingdom who live with conditions such as pulmonary hypertension (PH) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are fit to fly yet require supplemental oxygen when flying around or out of the UK; notes with concern that a recent report by the organisation found that, of the 71 airlines surveyed, (a) less than a quarter supply free supplementary oxygen, (b) a quarter do not supply supplementary oxygen at all, (3) two thirds of the airlines would not allow disabled air travellers with lung conditions to bring their own oxygen for use in-flight and (4) of the airlines that provide supplemental oxygen but charge for it, each levies a different fee ranging from &pound;50 to &pound;500 per trip; finds it disappointing that parliamentary motion <a href="../../../Apps2/business/motions/Default.aspx?motionid=16990">S3M-4527, </a>lodged on 25 June 2009, has not been embraced by external stakeholders to the desired degree and that only Thomson Holidays has followed the example of British Airways, Emirates Airlines and Cathay Pacific by dropping charges for in-flight oxygen provision for those who need it, and urges all airlines to take measures to axe supplemental oxygen surcharges and to allow patients, as in the United States of America, to bring their own oxygen supply free of charge.</p>
