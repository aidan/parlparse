<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5766</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Small Scotch Whisky Distillers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament values the contribution made by small Scottish distillers to the Scotch whisky industry and urges the Scottish Executive to give full consideration to their needs in its examination of proposals to give stronger legal protection for Scotch whisky at a European Union level and to ensure that any such legislation does not discriminate against small Scottish distillers by prohibiting the bulk export of genuine Scotch for bottling overseas, which would be a restraint of trade and detrimental to their interests.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5765</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Mobile Post Office Services in the Highlands and Islands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends all those involved in the setting up and operation of the mobile post office in Caithness, particularly the sub-postmaster, Glynn Jackson, who has worked hard to retain postal services to five villages in Caithness; further commends Robin Dagleish at Muir of Ord who has been piloting outreach services to Marybank and Achterneed in Ross-shire, both pilots developing a new type of postal service delivery capable of meeting rural needs, and encourages the Post Office to apply the lessons learned from these pilots more widely throughout the Highlands and Islands.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5764</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Scottish Children&rsquo;s Parliament and Scottish Youth Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Parliament on developing a creative, dynamic and innovative programme which involves children under the age of 14 of mixed abilities and backgrounds in decision-making processes and which has recently set up a temporary website for all schools in Scotland to access; encourages the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Parliament to continue its efforts to enable all children under the age of 14 to become &quot;virtual citizens of Scotland&quot;; expresses concern at the recent swingeing reduction in funding for the Scottish Youth Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Executive to continue to provide adequate funding for both the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Parliament  and the Scottish Youth Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5763</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Reduce Class Sizes - Employ the Teachers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern that so many of our recently qualified teachers are still without permanent teaching posts; is further concerned that the number of available places for postgraduate teacher training is falling year on year; believes that the Scottish Executive is missing opportunities to reduce class sizes by not ensuring that there are permanent posts for all recently qualified teachers and by reducing teacher recruitment, and considers that this is a missed opportunity to improve the education of all Scotland&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5762#</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Reconnecting Communities by Rail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the work undertaken by communities across Scotland to enhance the rail network; recognises in particular the long-standing need to reopen railway stations at Blackford, Greenloaning, St Andrews and Levenmouth, and further recognises the role that community rail partnerships and businesses can play in developing new services and enhancing the quality and uptake of existing services.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Mr John Swinney<strong>*</strong>, Christine May<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5761</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Charities and Churches Water Charge Exemption</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret that the consultation paper regarding the proposed charging arrangements for the payment of water charges for non-household premises from 2010 contained no specific reference to relief for churches and charities; further notes that, following the closure of the consultation in January 2007, the Scottish Executive has confirmed that it has no plans to extend the current exemption scheme beyond 2010 or to establish a replacement for the scheme when it expires; considers that this decision is short-sighted and will merely serve to place a significant burden on the majority of charities and church organisations, despite the fact that seeking to maintain the long-term future of these organisations is crucial to ensuring that they continue to play an integral part in the well-being of our communities, and calls on the Executive to reconsider this decision.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5757</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Supporting Scotland&rsquo;s Only Subway</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes plans by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) to expand the Glasgow underground network, which would enhance public transport for many parts of Glasgow that are currently not served by the underground; notes that the system was last modernised 30 years ago; further notes that the underground is a popular mode of transport for Glaswegians and visitors to Glasgow, and believes that Scotland&rsquo;s only underground system is an integral part of the transport system and that its expansion to the east of Glasgow would enhance both Glasgow&rsquo;s and the wider Scottish economy by providing an efficient and convenient way of joining up journeys.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5756</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>The National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) (Scotland) Regulations 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (SSI 2007/139).</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5755</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Pi Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises 14 March (3/14 when written in the US convention) to be international Pi Day and also the birthday of the famous theoretical physicist, Albert Einstein; further recognises that the mathematical constant Pi (&#960;)<strong>,</strong> which has a numerical value approximately equal to 3.14159 and represents the ratio of a circle&rsquo;s circumference to its diameter, is one of the most significant numbers in mathematics with countless uses in engineering and physics and numerous practical applications within the construction, manufacturing, engineering, telecommunications and computing industries, and further recognises the intellectual intrigue provided by the number for mathematicians and mathematics enthusiasts in Scotland and throughout the world, since its first calculation by the Babylonians several thousand years ago, and the entitlement of such people to a day to celebrate their arithmetical passion for this, one of the few numbers to have been proved to be transcendental and for which there is thus no possible algebraic expression.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5753</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Together Since 1957 - 50th Anniversary of the Treaty of Rome</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that 25 March 2007 marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome which established the European Economic Community, now the European Union, and represented a decisive step away from the turmoil of world war and towards the building of a modern peaceful Europe; recognises the benefits that the last 50 years have brought member states in terms of freedom, democracy, prosperity, jobs and growth; appreciates that European citizens now have access to a single market, easier travel across EU borders, opportunities to study across Europe, access to EU regional aid such as the structural funds programme which has benefited many Scottish communities, improved regional policy, gender equality and better consumer rights; is aware that there are many events taking place across Europe to mark this important anniversary and encourages Scottish people to participate; notes that the European institutions have agreed that celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary and Spring Day in Europe on 9 May should focus on Europe&rsquo;s young people, and agrees that it is appropriate, when celebrating the freedom, peace and prosperity that the EU has achieved so far, to look to the next 50 years in Europe and consider what kind of Europe its citizens and, in particular, its young citizens, wish for the future.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5752</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Poverty Premium</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep concern that some 240,000 children live in poverty and that the poorest families pay higher prices for basic necessities such as fuel and banking as the costs incurred in purchasing such goods and services can amount to a poverty premium of around &pound;1,000, representing some 9% of the disposable income of an average-sized family; affirms that only an independent parliament, with full powers over the economy, tax and benefits, can tackle endemic poverty, but in the meantime calls on the Scottish government, within its limited powers, to demand that the power companies and banks introduce practices which assist those on low incomes rather than punish them.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Sandra White, Michael Matheson</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5751</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Single Status in Argyll and Bute Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses disappointment with Argyll and Bute Council for its policy regarding the implementation of its single status agreement; notes that many council employees will lose a substantial level of earnings, with some losing as much as 28% of their current salary; believes that the impact of the proposal falls disproportionately on low-paid staff, particularly women; recognises the strength of opinion against the council&rsquo;s proposals, and urges the council to increase its proposed budget for funding the agreement to minimise the detrimental impact among its staff.</p>
<p>Supported by: Maureen Macmillan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5750</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Say No to Fluoridation of Scotland&rsquo;s Water Supply</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about recent comments made by Andy Kerr, Minister for Health and Community Care, in <em>Holyrood</em> in support of mass medication through the fluoridation of Scotland&rsquo;s water supply; notes that fluoridation of the water supply has been linked with brittle bone disease, cancer and many other conditions; further notes that not enough is known about the dangers of the cumulative effects of fluoride on the individual; believes that the claimed benefits in relation to preventing tooth decay may be outweighed by the documented negative side effects of water fluoridation, and finally agrees to oppose any future legislation to introduce mass medication through Scotland&rsquo;s water supply.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5744</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Pay Nurses a Proper Wage Rise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the decision on Scottish nurses&rsquo; pay was announced at a Labour Party meeting and not in the Parliament or indeed in the Cabinet; believes that this shows a serious lack of respect for the Parliament; also notes that, although nurses in Scotland will get their pay rise in one stage, the pay rise is still below the rate of inflation and is in effect a pay cut, and calls on the Scottish Executive to reward all public sector workers in Scotland with an above inflation rise and continue to ignore the Chancellor as they have done today.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5732</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Support for Micropower</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive is currently finalising its planning guidance on renewable energy, Scottish Planning Policy 6 (SPP 6); believes that micropower, including community-scale combined heat and power, has considerable potential to power and heat Scotland&rsquo;s homes, public buildings and businesses if given the right support at this crucial stage in the industry&rsquo;s development; believes that micropower can help reduce CO2 emissions from buildings and therefore has a vital role to play in combating climate change; believes that SPP 6 should set ambitious but achievable targets for the inclusion of micropower in new developments, and therefore calls on the Executive to require new developments to reduce their predicted CO2 emissions by at least 15% over building regulations through the use of on-site micropower technologies, to apply initially to developments over 500m<sup>2</sup> in size, and to all new developments over time.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5730</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Slave Labour - the Hidden Cost of Chocolate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns outright the use of slave labour in the manufacture of chocolate; notes that slave traders are currently trafficking young boys aged between 12 and 16 and selling them to cocoa farmers in the C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire; further notes that there are around 600,000 cocoa farms in the C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire and that it is estimated that the number of children forced to work as slaves on these farms may be as high as 15,000; recognises that, in addition to this illegal trafficking, the implicated cocoa farmers subject the children to inhumane living conditions and, besides overworking them, do not feed the children properly and frequently beat them to make them work harder or if they try to escape; calls on the Scottish Executive to do everything it can to put a stop to the modern slave trade by putting pressure at the highest level on all international chocolate companies, agencies and governments, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to ensure that all chocolate used and sold within the Parliament has not been produced using slave labour.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5729#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Welcome for the First of Midlothian&rsquo;s 1,000 New Council Houses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Midlothian Council on completing the first of 1,000 new council houses to be built under its ambitious housing plans; notes that the properties at Bill Russell Grove in Dalkeith are the first significant number of council houses to be built in Scotland in 20 years; hopes that the new tenants will be very proud of their superb new homes; recognises the very significant contribution that the &pound;105 million project across Midlothian will make in providing much-needed social housing in the area; looks forward to seeing further new homes built in due course in Penicuik, Bonnyrigg, Gorebridge and throughout Midlothian, and believes that all councils in Scotland should follow Midlothian&rsquo;s lead and cater for the significant need for social housing that exists in every local authority area.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5727</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Micropower and SPP6</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive is currently finalising Scottish Planning Policy 6 (SPP 6) on renewable energy; believes that small-scale renewables have considerable potential to reduce carbon emissions from buildings and therefore should be given the Executive&rsquo;s full support; further notes that more than 80 councils in England have successfully required the installation of small-scale renewables in new developments and have helped reduce climate change emissions from new buildings as a result; also believes that the Executive should set bold and ambitious targets for reduction in CO2 emissions from new buildings, and therefore calls on the Executive to require that all new buildings, regardless of size, reduce their predicted CO2 emissions by at least 20% over building regulations standards, while supporting local authorities who set more ambitious targets.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5726#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Crichton Campus and the University of Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the work to develop an academic strategy for higher and further education in Dumfries and Galloway but, conscious that the failure of the University of Glasgow to recruit an intake of new undergraduates at the Crichton Campus in Dumfries this year may prejudge the outcome of that strategy, considers that the Scottish Executive should take all necessary steps to ensure that recruitment is resumed for the current year.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5715#</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>The Lack of Park-and-Ride in South Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes key public transport improvements being delivered by SEStran including bus priority measures, a bus tracker system and cycleway improvements, but is concerned that key schemes for three park-and-ride sites in south Edinburgh at Straiton, Sherrifhall and Lothianburn have yet to open and that the lack of park-and-ride sites in the south of the city is leading to increased commuter parking in residential streets, where residents&rsquo; parking is already made difficult by the extension of the controlled parking scheme.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5521#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that people who suffer from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a severe and progressive genetic muscle wasting disease predominantly affecting boys and for which there is currently no cure, are dying in Scotland on average 10 years earlier then their counterparts in England; believes that an improvement in the life expectancy and experiences of these young people must be a priority for the Scottish Executive; considers that, in addition to enhanced medical research, better support services, equipment and adapted housing can make a massive difference to the quality of life of people with DMD and can contribute to extending their life expectancy; welcomes the development in 2003 of the Scottish Muscle Network, based at Yorkhill, as a national managed clinical network benefiting patients in Stirling and across Scotland, but believes that more must be done to improve both life quality and life expectancy for people with DMD in Scotland.</p>
