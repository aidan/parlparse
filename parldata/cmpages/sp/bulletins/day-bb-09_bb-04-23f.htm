<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3959</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Iraqi Trade Unions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Abdullah Muhsin of the General Federation of Iraqi Workers to Scotland and congratulates NASUWT on sponsoring his visit to the Scottish Trades Union Congress Annual Congress 2009; believes that he was supposed to bring representatives of Iraqi and Kurdish teachers&rsquo; unions with him but that their visas to leave Iraq and enter the United Kingdom were not granted because the Iraqi Government has seized control of the teachers&rsquo; unions under decision 3 of the Governing Council, which was appointed by the United States of America as the nominal authority in Iraq between July 2003 and June 2004 supposedly to force elections on these unions that have held conferences and elected their leadership since 2003, and condemns the UK Government for its actions in refusing these visas and thereby supporting the suppression of trade unions in Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3958</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government and STUC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the support of the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s plans for a Scottish Investment Bank; welcomes the engagement of the STUC with the Scottish Government on this issue, and notes the STUC&rsquo;s support for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on the budget of HM Treasury.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3957</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>University of Edinburgh Teaching Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success of Edinburgh University Students&rsquo; Association&rsquo;s Teaching Awards, which recognise the outstanding contribution of staff at the university; highlights that over 2,700 students nominated staff for being exceptional teachers and that over 620 staff were nominated; believes that the scheme is a positive way for students to push for high standards of teaching, especially in research-intensive institutions; congratulates other schemes being run at universities across Scotland; further highlights the teaching awards as best practice in recognising the hard work of staff at the University of Edinburgh and encouraging excellence in teaching, as well as in research.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3956&diams;</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Road Haulage Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement in the UK Budget of a planned fuel duty increase of 2p per litre from September 2009, which comes on top of the 2p per litre increase effective from the start of April 2009; believes that these rises will massively increase costs for road haulage companies in the South of Scotland region and across the country, putting them under extra pressure as the economic recession takes hold; recognises the important role played by the road haulage industry in providing support to other industries as well as direct employment, and further believes that the industry will need support during the economic downturn.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3955</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Viewforth High School, Kirkcaldy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the contribution of Viewforth High School to educational services in the community; notes with concern reports of its fall to the bottom of a priority list in the School Estate Development Programme; recognises the urgent need for a replacement building following an audit by Fife Council five years ago confirming that the building was substandard for the role that it plays in providing education; considers that the delay in the planned timescale from 2011 to a building schedule of 2017-18 is unacceptable; acknowledges the concern among local politicians, community representatives, parents and pupils; calls on Fife Council to honour the SNP&rsquo;s pledge to match the previous administration&rsquo;s school building programme &quot;brick for brick&quot;, and urges the Scottish Government to sort out urgently its public sector funding mechanisms to ensure that vital school buildings are delivered without delay.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3954</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Parents Like Us Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Parents Like Us Festival that will take place from 8 to 10 May 2009 in Leith; notes that Parents Like Us is Scotland&rsquo;s biggest festival for parents with children under six; congratulates Parents Like Us on its fifth anniversary; also notes that the programme is full of different activities to suit different age groups and interests; highlights that the festival website and full programme can be found at www.parentslikeus.co.uk, and wishes the volunteers and organisers the best of luck for the festival.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3953</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Dalmilling Golf Course</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great concern the proposal to close Dalmilling Golf Course in Ayr; recognises that Dalmilling Golf Course is a much-loved and vital public sports facility; considers that its closure would lead to a serious decline in the provision of sports facilities for local people, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to South Ayrshire Council to prevent the closure of Dalmilling Golf Course.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3952</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Jack Jones (1913-2009), Socialist and Trade Unionist</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament mourns the passing of Jack Jones, former general secretary of the Transport and General Workers&rsquo; Union, International Brigader, Liverpool city councillor and President of the National Pensioners&rsquo; Convention; applauds his lifetime commitment to improving the lives of working people; recognises that he fought fascism, poverty and inequality with his heart and soul, and extends its deepest sympathies to his family, friends and many comrades around the world.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3950</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Exorbitant Legalised Money Lending</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the high APR of 399.7% offered on personal loans by Greenwood Personal Credit and the 189.2% APR attached to the new Provident Personal Credit pre-paid debit card; considers that, during this time of economic turbulence, financial services companies should refrain from charging excessive interest rates while the Bank of England interest rates remain at 0.5%, and is concerned that these rates are targeted at those people currently suffering the most financial hardship and serve only to increase poverty levels and reinforce poverty among people already struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3949</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>UK Government&rsquo;s Admission of Complicity in Torture</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&rsquo;s recent report on human rights in which it considers that the UK Government tacitly admits to using &quot;intelligence possibly derived through torture&quot;; further notes Craig Murray&rsquo;s statement that the names of sources are omitted from intelligence reports so that it cannot be proven that torture was used in producing that intelligence; believes that the report therefore negates the UK Government&rsquo;s supposed condemnation of torture and that when it uses evidence obtained from practices such as immersing victims in boiling water, as used in Uzbekistan, or taking them to the point of drowning, as extensively practised by the United States of America under the euphemism of waterboarding, then it is as guilty as the government or agency that carries out the torture, and is of the opinion that torture does not protect lives but simply ensures that the victim provides whatever &quot;evidence&quot; is required by the torturer and that the use of torture can only increase hatred and violence, not reduce it.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3948.1</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 2014 Legacy Plan</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3948) in the name of Shona Robison, after &quot;Games in Glasgow&quot; insert &quot;welcomes this new spirit of cooperation and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the UK Government to maximise the benefit of sporting events in Scotland and the wider United Kingdom, especially the 2014 Commonwealth Games and 2012 Olympic Games, in terms of encouraging sporting participation and harnessing the talents of Scots; notes Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s own 2014 legacy plan and calls on the Scottish Government to work with other local authorities to produce their own legacy plans to meet shared aspirations on tackling obesity and low levels of participation&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3947.1</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Scottish Newspaper Industry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3947) in the name of David Whitton, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses concern at moves towards compulsory redundancies such as those imposed by Trinity Mirror at the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail</em>; notes the importance of a viable and diverse national, regional and local newspaper industry to Scotland&rsquo;s culture; recognises the need to retain talent in Scotland&rsquo;s creative media industries, and calls for all newspaper and media organisations considering restructuring, reorganisation or redundancy to engage in meaningful negotiations with the relevant workforce representatives in order to minimise the economic impact of any job cuts and the need for compulsory redundancies.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3947.2</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Scottish Newspaper Industry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3947) in the name of David Whitton, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;calls for all newspaper and media organisations considering restructuring, reorganisation or redundancy to engage in meaningful negotiations with the relevant workforce representatives in order to minimise the economic impact of any job cuts, and calls on the Scottish Government to hold urgent talks with Trinity Mirror and to work with all media groups to allow new industry models to emerge that will encourage investment not just in local newspapers but in local online services and new local TV companies.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3938.1</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>West of Scotland Transport Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3938) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;and believes that the priorities for this investment should be sustainable modes of travel, such as proper funding for walking, cycling and other forms of active travel across Greater Glasgow, as well as support for the local authority proposals for water buses to serve people living and working around the Clyde, a service that should also help to create jobs in shipbuilding in the west of Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3938.2</strong> <strong>Gavin Brown:</strong> <strong>West of Scotland Transport Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3938) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &quot;especially&quot; to end and insert &quot;; therefore regrets the previous Labour-led administration&rsquo;s disappointing record on delivering improvements to key road links connecting the west of Scotland, notably the substantial delays and cost overruns in upgrading the M8 and M74; welcomes the fact that the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link project pioneered by the previous Labour-led administration has been cancelled, thereby freeing up investment for the crucial Edinburgh to Glasgow Rail Improvement Programme, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure the clear prioritisation of transport projects both in the west of Scotland and elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3938.3</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>West of Scotland Transport Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3938) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;welcomes the significant opportunity presented by the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games for the creation of legacy transport infrastructure projects in the west of Scotland, including the proposed redevelopment of Dalmarnock station as a key public transport hub for the Games and the area, offering speedy direct rail links to the main Games venues and to Celtic Park from Lanarkshire, the city centre and the west in particular, as well as a high standard of pedestrian and cyclist pathways through the area; supports the work of Clyde Gateway in developing the project, and urges the Scottish Government to give the Dalmarnock station project its full backing.&quot;</p>
