          <p><strong>*S2M-817</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Protecting 
            Children from Advertising in Schools</strong>-That the Parliament 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to protect children from the promotion 
            of brand names and commercial companies through sponsorship and advertising 
            in Scotland's schools as the teaching and learning environment should 
            be devoted to educational materials.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-816#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>The 
            Importance of Modern Language Learning</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the First Minister's commitment in his New Year message to 
            encourage Scots to promote our nation abroad, as well as inviting 
            more foreign nationals to live and work in Scotland; is aware that 
            the Lisbon Strategy highlights the importance of language skills in 
            the economic life of the European Union; recognises that, as part 
            of an enlarged European Union, the people of Scotland have an obligation 
            to become linguistically diverse; recognises that linguistic diversity 
            not only assists communication and increases economic opportunities, 
            but also allows children to grow to respect different cultures; welcomes 
            the European Commission's report <em>Promoting Language Learning and 
            Linguistic Diversity: An Action Plan 2004-2006 </em>and notes its 
            aim of encouraging member states to make language learning a priority 
            for pre-school and primary school children; agrees that early language 
            learning is the basis for future language competency; notes that current 
            policy in Scotland is that all students are entitled to experience 
            learning a modern language no later than P6 and that the Scottish 
            Executive recognises that pre-school years are an ideal age to enrich 
            children's language experiences; welcomes the success of partial immersion 
            projects in introducing children to a modern language at the early 
            stage of primary school, and considers that the Executive should build 
            on this experience.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-815</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Tesco 
            Discriminating Against Scots</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the actions of Tesco plc in discriminating against Scots and 
            the Scottish legal system in the operation of its home phone service 
            in that contracts with customers are governed by English law and the 
            exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts, even though the company's 
            customer service centre is in Inverness; believes that this situation 
            is symptomatic of Scotland's economic problems in that the high quality 
            legal jobs are outwith Scotland while the call centre jobs are located 
            here, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to use what powers it 
            has to enter into discussions with major UK companies to encourage 
            them to take due note of the discrete Scottish market.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-814</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Companies 
            (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That 
            the Parliament endorses the principle that, in the context of provisions 
            in the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) 
            Bill enabling charities to convert to become community interest companies, 
            conversion should be regulated and agrees that the provisions in the 
            Bill that relate to the power to regulate such conversion should be 
            considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-813</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Gender 
            Recognition Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament endorses 
            the principle of giving transsexual people legal recognition of their 
            acquired gender and agrees that the provisions in the Gender Recognition 
            Bill that relate to devolved matters should be considered by the UK 
            Parliament thereby ensuring a consistent UK approach and early compliance 
            with the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights with respect 
            to the Convention rights of transsexual people under Article 8 (right 
            to respect for private life) and Article 12 (right to marry).</P>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-812</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Conduct 
            of Health Review Consultations</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            that public consultations on NHS centralisations, redesigns, rationalisations 
            and closures are repeatedly being condemned and questioned by the 
            public, trade unions, community representatives and clinicians in 
            terms of their transparency, processes, democracy, accountability 
            and legitimacy of conclusions; believes that public confidence in 
            NHS board consultations is extremely low; is concerned by allegations 
            made by senior clinicians, in respect of the Queen Mother's Hospital 
            consultation by NHS Greater Glasgow, that evidence has been distorted 
            and/or suppressed, and considers that all submissions, written or 
            oral, to such consultations should, by mandate, be published in full 
            with all documentation, evidence, statistics and research.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Frances Curran, Roseanna Cunningham</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-811#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>London 
            Olympic Bid</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the decision 
            by Her Majesty's Government to provide an unlimited funding guarantee 
            for the London bid to host the Olympic Games in 2012 and, whilst happy 
            to support the bid's success, believes that London should share financial 
            responsibility for the guarantee in line with the original intention 
            of Her Majesty's Government, outlined in the response to <em>A London 
            Olympic Bid for 2012</em> by the Department for Culture, Media and 
            Sport.</P>
          <p></P>
          <p><strong>S2M-810</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Saudi 
            Arabian Ambassador's Reception</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the US Department of State's report on Saudi Arabia which states that 
            Saudi citizens have &quot;neither the right nor the legal means to 
            change their government&quot;, that &quot;security forces continued 
            to abuse detainees and prisoners, arbitrarily arrest and detain persons, 
            and hold them in incommunicado detention&quot;, that &quot;the Government 
            prohibits or restricts freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, 
            religion and movement&quot; and that &quot;other continuing problems 
            included discrimination and violence against women, discrimination 
            against ethnic and religious minorities, and strict limitations on 
            worker rights&quot;; believes that it is completely unacceptable for 
            any member to accept an invitation to dine with the Ambassador of 
            Saudi Arabia, Prince Turki Al Faisal, on 26<SUP> </SUP>January 2004 
            in Edinburgh as he is an official representative of a dictatorial 
            and oppressive regime, and calls on all members to boycott this reception.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-809</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Access 
            to Scottish Current Accounts from the Post Office</strong>-That the 
            Parliament urges the Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS plc and the Clydesdale 
            Bank to match the facilities, offered by other UK banks, for customers 
            to access their current accounts at post office branches nationwide, 
            which will both increase footfall in Post Offices and allow improved 
            access to banking for geographically remote and socially excluded 
            communities.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-808</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Consultations on Parliamentary Issues</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees that it should give more financial support to enable MSPs to 
            organise local consultation on parliamentary issues, not just on local 
            issues, and should help to fund the travel costs of citizens who have 
            to go a long way to a consultative meeting.</P>

            the blatantly untrue statements by Robert Kilroy-Silk that Arabs are 
            &quot;suicide bombers, limb amputators, women repressors&quot;, greatly 
            regrets the rising tide of Islamophobia of which he is part; believes 
            that his efforts to claim that his statements are justified by &quot;free 
            speech&quot; do great harm to promoting genuine free speech within 
            a rational debate and constructively criticising any foolish attitudes 
            caused by excessive political correctness, and urges all relevant 
            bodies to promote better education and discussion about Islam and 
            Arab culture.</P>

            House Mission, established in 1907 and now a registered charity, based 
            in East Campbell Street, Glasgow, which provides support and advice 
            and over 150 meals per day for the homeless and disadvantaged and 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure provision of a funding stream 
            that will allow this vital work to continue.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson</P>

            and Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill against the closure

            the Parliament regrets the decision by <em>The Herald</em> to stop 
            its monthly polling of voting intentions in Scotland; considers that 
            the poll makes a useful contribution to bringing public and political 
            issues before the people of Scotland, and urges the management of

            which operates in Aberdeen, Fife, Inverness and Dumfries and Galloway, 
            whereby GPs refer patients to participate in projects aimed at improving 
            the environment; recognises the importance of such initiatives in 
            promoting both the health of the individual and community spirit, 
            and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that such imaginative schemes

            but that as yet the public have not been informed if either or both 
            are intended to operate as private prisons, and expresses the view
