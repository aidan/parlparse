    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-265</b> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Location of Meetings of the Parliament</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises that taking its activities outwith Edinburgh and Glasgow on a
    regular basis would send a positive signal to the whole of Scotland and calls upon the
    Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Parliamentary Bureau to identify a suitable
    location in the north east of Scotland to host meetings of the Parliament in the event
    that a temporary home is required.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-264#</b> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Police Resources and Special Events</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive to address the anomaly whereby Scottish
    police forces have to cover the cost of policing visiting dignitaries and other special
    duties from their existing budgets unlike the Metropolitan Police who were recently given
    an additional £176 million in 1999-2000 to cover such events.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-263</b> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Stane Primary School</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament expresses its sympathy and support for the pupils, parents and teachers of

    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-261#</b> <strong>George Lyon: The Kintyre Economy</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes the severe problems facing the Kintyre economy as it faces the
    combination of a downturn in all its primary industries, a drop in tourist numbers in the
    last two years and the threat of Sea Containers pulling out of the Campbeltown-Ballycastle
    ferry service, and calls for co-ordinated and effective action to ensure that the ferry
    crossing remains and that the necessary investments are made to safeguard the long term
    viability of Kintyre&#146;s communities.</p>

    play an active and positive role within the European Union; recognises that our full

    the future economic success and prosperity of Scotland, and believes that Scottish
    businesses, communities and families will be best served by an independent Scotland
