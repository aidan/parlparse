          <p><strong>*S1M-2617</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Japan and Commercial 
            Whaling</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to request that Her Majesty&#146;s Government convey to the Japanese 
            Government in the strongest terms its opposition to a return to full-scale 
            commercial whaling and to request that the Japanese Government answers 
            the allegation, made in a report by Greenpeace, that it is using development 
            aid to buy votes in favour of a return to full-scale commercial whaling 
            from small nation states within the International Whaling Commission. 
            <strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2616</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: South of Scotland 
            Alliance</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of 
            the South of Scotland Alliance, comprised of Dumfries and Galloway 
            Council, Scottish Borders Council, Scottish Enterprise Dumfries and 
            Galloway and Scottish Enterprise Borders; notes its manifesto message 
            &quot;Moving the South of Scotland Forward&quot;; further notes its 
            five key targets of raising the profile and image of the south of 
            Scotland, examining and rectifying the causes of economic market failure, 
            promoting inclusion and equal opportunities, working for increased 
            funding for the area and building international links; recognises 
            that this area in particular has suffered from the consequences of 
            foot-and-mouth disease and has in the past been overlooked, and congratulates 
            the South of Scotland Alliance on its endeavours to rectify these 
            matters.</p>

            notes that 28 April 2002 is International Workers&#146; Memorial Day, 
            a commemoration of those who have died or suffered accidents or ill 
            health as a result of work, and calls for this day to be widely observed 
            in Scotland through action to improve safety and provide a healthier 
            working environment.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2614</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Oxfam Scotland</strong>&#151;That

            people to give foreign currency notes and coins made worthless by 
            the euro to any of Oxfam Scotland&#146;s 68 shops; believes that Oxfam 
            Scotland will put such currency to very good use, once exchanged in 
            the developing world, and urges all those with soon-to-be useless 
            coins and small denomination notes, of any of the twelve EU member 
            states which have signed up to the euro, left over from holidays and 
            visits to respond to this excellent initiative and by doing so helping 
            poor people to live more tolerable lives. </p>
