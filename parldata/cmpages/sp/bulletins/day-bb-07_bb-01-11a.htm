<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am&#9;</strong>Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Education with specific reference to Skills Academies&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5386</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Education with specific reference to Skills Academies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that our education system should provide children with opportunities to flourish along the lines of their own particular aptitudes and inclinations; notes that for many children over the age of 14 this could predominantly involve activity in a practical or vocational sphere, rather than in a traditional academic one, and welcomes the proposal to establish skills academies, be they stand-alone or attached to schools or colleges, depending on what is most appropriate for a local area, as centres of excellence to extend opportunities to access vocational education to students from the age of 14. </p>
<p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-5386.4</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Education with specific reference to Skills Academies</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5386) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the priority given to improving education standards by the Scottish Executive, local authorities, schools and other partners; recognises that the Executive&rsquo;s investment in new and refurbished schools, increased teacher numbers, reducing class sizes, strong parental involvement and stable industrial relations is providing the right environment for real and lasting change for Scotland&rsquo;s children; welcomes the new opportunities that are being developed through A Curriculum for Excellence and Determined to Succeed, including enabling young people across Scotland aged 14 to 16 to undertake vocational learning in further education colleges as part of the school-based curriculum; believes that a strong and relevant education system is fundamental to securing a smart, successful Scotland in which all our 16 to 19 year-olds are in education, employment or training, and calls for steadily improving opportunities for young people to achieve success in education including, particularly, opportunities to study a wider range of vocational options.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5386.2</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Education with specific reference to Skills Academies</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5386) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;for many children&quot; to end and insert &quot;most political parties have recognised the need for more vocational experiences for pupils over 14 since 2003 and is concerned about lack of progress in providing this to date; agrees with the position of the Schools and Colleges Review and the Parliament&rsquo;s Education Committee in its recent Pupil Motivation inquiry that all children should have vocational opportunities and that these should not be restricted by assessment of academic ability at the age of 14; acknowledges that the real challenge is to provide opportunities and choice for all pupils, working together with schools and colleges, and notes the concerns of skills and trades organisations that the proposal for skills academies provided for pupils with lack of academic ability, as proposed recently by the First Minister, is not what is required by them to meet current and future skills demand.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Health with specific reference to Accident and Emergency Unit Provision&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5389</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Health with specific reference to Accident and Emergency Unit Provision</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament does not accept the case put forward for the closure of accident and emergency units at Ayr Hospital and Monklands Hospital; recognises the real dangers of the proposals for accident and emergency provision in Greater Glasgow, and calls on the Scottish Executive to re-examine its decision to approve these closures. </p>
<p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-5389.3</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Health with specific reference to Accident and Emergency Unit Provision</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5389) in the name of Mrs Nanette Milne, leave out from &quot;does not&quot; to end and insert &quot;reaffirms its view that Delivering for Health provides a coherent and consensual basis for service change in NHS Scotland; notes the support expressed in previous debates by Members from across the Parliament and health stakeholders for key aspects of the policy, including promoting local access to services and balancing local delivery with the need to have centres of excellence that provide high-quality, modern, specialist care, focusing on primary care services, separating scheduled and unscheduled care and providing community casualty units; commends the progress being made to implement the key directions set out in Delivering for Health; supports the unparalleled investment in health and health improvement made by the Scottish Executive; welcomes the requirement for investment in primary care and in community casualty services before changes are made to existing accident and emergency services; commends the hard work and outstanding commitment of NHS staff to new and flexible ways of working needed to provide modern and responsive services; supports the principle of a modern, well-resourced NHS in Scotland, free at the point of need, and believes that any necessary changes in the NHS in Scotland should be based on the needs of local communities.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5389.2</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Health with specific reference to Accident and Emergency Unit Provision</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5389) in the name of Mrs Nanette Milne, insert at end&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;particularly in the light of recent events at Wishaw General Hospital which was forced to close its doors to all but the most severe emergency cases.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5389.1</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Health with specific reference to Accident and Emergency Unit Provision</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5389) in the name of Mrs Nanette Milne, leave out from &quot;and calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;further expresses concern that hospitals are showing the strain caused by insufficient capacity with, for example, Wishaw General closing to admissions; believes that PFI costs are sucking resources from the NHS, and calls on the Scottish Executive to reverse the closure decisions and conduct an urgent review of NHS capacity with reference to meeting actual need and to abandon the wasteful PFI policy to fund capital projects.&quot; </p>
