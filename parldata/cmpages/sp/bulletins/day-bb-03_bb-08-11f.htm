          <P><strong>*S2M-256</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Welfare 
            of Asylum Seekers</strong>-That the Parliament notes the concern of 
            many regarding the treatment of asylum seekers in Scotland by the 
            Home Office; notes that the Scottish Executive has responsibility 
            for welfare services to asylum seekers living in Scottish communities 
            under the Home Office dispersal programme, and calls on the Executive 
            to make representations to Her Majesty's Government with a view to 
            ensuring that, wherever asylum seekers reside in Scotland, their welfare 
            and policy relating to their treatment is the responsibility of the 
            Executive.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, 
            Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-255#</strong> <strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing:</strong> 
            <strong>Elgin Bypass</strong>-That the Parliament considers that Moray 
            Council should make full representations to the Scottish Executive 
            regarding proposals for an Elgin bypass; notes the economic benefits 
            to Elgin and the north-east of Scotland as a whole that a bypass would 
            bring, and further notes the overwhelming public support for such 
            a project.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-254</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>National 
            Sexual Health Week, 4 to 10 August 2003</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that 4 to 10 August 2003 is national sexual health week and 
            congratulates the fpa (formerly Family Planning Association) for launching 
            this initiative to help raise awareness of sexual health issues and, 
            in particular, sexually transmitted infections; notes that the fpa 
            is calling for a speedy nationwide roll-out of a screening programme 
            for chlamydia as a cost-effective prevention measure, and strongly 
            urges the Scottish Executive to address this issue in its forthcoming 
            sexual health strategy for Scotland.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong>, Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong>, 
            Margaret Jamieson<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, 
            Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>,

          <P> <strong>*S2M-253</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Communication 
            Workers Union Campaign on Remote Sourcing of Call Centre Jobs</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that the call centre industry now comprises a 
            significant sector of the Scottish economy, that there are now over 
            50,000 jobs in the 250 call centres in Scotland and that 17,000 of 
            these jobs are located in Glasgow alone; is therefore concerned at 
            the threat to over 1,000 jobs in Glasgow by British Telecom's outsourcing 
            of 2,000 call centre jobs from across the United Kingdom to Bangalore 
            and New Delhi in India; considers that there is now a significant 
            risk to jobs in the industry in Scotland from further remote sourcing 
            by call centre operators following the example of British Telecom; 
            notes that the Call Centre Association assesses the labour cost of 
            English-speaking IT-literate graduates in India at 10-15% of their 
            European counterparts, and calls on British Telecom and other call 
            centre operators to invest in their high quality workforce in Scotland 
            and on the Scottish Executive to continue to work through Scottish 
            Development International to promote Scotland as a quality location 
            for value-added high-skill call centres and protect existing call 
            centre jobs.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-252</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Maternity 
            Services Review by Argyll and Clyde NHS Board</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the return of maternity services to the Vale of Leven Hospital 
            and commends the continuing efforts and commitment of midwives in 
            establishing a midwife-led unit that will commence service in September 
            2003; notwithstanding this, notes with dismay the majority decision 
            of Argyll and Clyde NHS Board on 29 July 2003 to centralise consultant-led 
            maternity services at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; acknowledges 
            that this decision will significantly diminish access for women to 
            maternity services given the geographical constraints of the area 
            and, in particular, the lack of direct public transport from Dumbarton, 
            Vale of Leven and Helensburgh to Paisley; further notes that a return 
            journey takes approximately five hours and is cost-prohibitive for 
            low-income families; recognises that this decision is inequitable 
            and reduces choice for women in the area; deeply regrets that the 
            option to work with NHS Greater Glasgow and have access to a consultant-led 
            unit serving women north of the river Clyde was rejected without substantive 
            justification, and therefore urges the Minister for Health and Community 
            Care to reject the decision of Argyll and Clyde NHS Board and restore 
            choice to the women of the area.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-251</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Treatment 
            of Ay Family</strong>-That the Parliament notes with grave concern 
            the inhuman treatment of the Ay family and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to initiate an immediate judicial review into the handling of this 
            case.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-250</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Scotland's 
            Infantry Regiments</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the suggestion 
            that there should be a reduction from six to five in Scotland's infantry 
            regiments by disbandment or amalgamation; notes with pride the histories 
            of the Scottish regiments; recognises the important local loyalties 
            for each of the regiments across Scotland; recalls the magnificent 
            campaign to save the Gordon Highlanders, which unfortunately was ignored 
            by Westminster in 1994, and calls on all Scotland, including the Scottish 
            Executive, to campaign for the retention of all Scotland's infantry 
            regiments.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-249</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen 
            Recycling and Waste Management</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the monies allocated to Aberdeen City Council for recycling and waste 
            management projects over the next 17 years; recognises that Scotland 
            needs to recycle more and discard less, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive and Her Majesty's Government to introduce legislation to 
            ensure that manufacturers and retailers reduce the excessive amount 
            of packaging that some persist in using to wrap their goods.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-248</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Test 
            Firing of Electro-magnetic Gun at Dundrennan Army Range</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns the decision by Her Majesty's Government to 
            invite the United States of America to test fire its experimental 
            electro-magnetic gun at the Dundrennan army range; regrets the failure 
            by the Ministry of Defence to consult with local people in respect 
            of this decision, and calls on the First Minister to initiate a consultation 
            process with local people and to write to the Secretary of State for 
            Defence requesting that he revoke access to the Dundrennan range by 
            the United States until the results of this consultation process are 
            known and are given due consideration.</P>

            Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>,

          <P> <strong>*S2M-247</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to the Archie Foundation</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Archie Foundation on raising more than £3 million in its appeal 
            for enhanced facilities for the new Children's Hospital in Aberdeen; 
            notes that the foundation was the winner of Best Regional Appeal category 
            in the Professional Fundraising/Institute of Fundraising Awards 2002, 
            and commends the people of the north east and the northern isles for 
            their generosity.</P>
