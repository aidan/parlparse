<p><strong>Questions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>S3W-18427</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much funding it has given to Argyll and Bute Council for the provision of the Luing ferry service in each year since 1999, also expressed as a percentage of the overall cost of the service, and what funding it plans to provide in future years.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-18474</strong> <strong>Gavin Brown:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many people in the Lothians region were charged with fraud in each of the last five years, broken down by local authority area.</p>

<p><strong>S3W-18477</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of its international framework, whether the Scottish Government will endeavour to ensure that the stated aim for its international activities of &quot;bringing a sharp economic growth focus to the promotion of Scotland abroad&quot; will not take precedence over its aim of &quot;managing Scotland&rsquo;s reputation as&hellip;an independent-minded and responsible nation&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-18478</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of its international framework, whether the Scottish Government will consider making representations in favour of modifying EU procurement law to allow public bodies within its responsibility to determine what products their contractors supply in order to avoid supporting companies that openly disregard human rights, for example by depleting regional water resources to the detriment of a population, by acting to limit workers&rsquo; freedom of association, or by subcontracting so as to benefit indirectly from child labour<font color="#0000ff">.</font></p>
<p><strong>S3W-18479</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the allegations made against the Coca-Cola company by Mark Thomas in his book, <em>Belching Out the Devil, Global Adventures with Coca-Cola</em>, will cause it to examine legal mechanisms whereby public bodies within its responsibility, such as NHS bodies, could prevent the sale of such products on their premises.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-18480</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive on what information the Committee of Inquiry on Crofting, chaired by Professor Shucksmith, based its recommendation that a centralised bull hire facility should be ended.</p>

<p><strong>S3W-18482</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considered the findings of a report by Peter Cook on the Crofters Cattle Quality Improvement Scheme before deciding to end the scheme as currently constituted.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-18483</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many people have been convicted of failing to inspect snares, or cause them to be inspected, at least once every day at intervals of no more than 24 hours, in each of the last five years.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-18484</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many people it understands to have set snares after having seen the tracks of protected species, in the last five years.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-18485</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it ensures that people do not set snares when they see the tracks of protected species and how this is monitored.</p>

<p><strong>S3W-18487</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will ban snaring in light of the result of a recent opinion poll showing 79% support for a total ban.</p>
