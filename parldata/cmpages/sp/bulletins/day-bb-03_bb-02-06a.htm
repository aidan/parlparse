          <p>9:30 am&#9;Debate on Local Government Bill - UK Legislation- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3833</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Government Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament endorses 
            the principle of including in the Local Government Bill powers for 
            the Scottish Ministers to issue directions and guidance to Scottish 
            local authorities in relation to staff transfer matters and agrees 
            that the relevant provisions to confer executive functions on the 
            Scottish Ministers in relation to these matters should be considered 
            by the UK Parliament. </p>
          <p>The Clerk has been informed that the following document(s) are relevant 
            to this debate.</p>
          <p>Executive Memorandum on Local Government Bill - UK legislation</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Stage 1 Debate on Proportional Representation 
            (Local Government Elections) (Scotland) Bill- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3727</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Proportional 
            Representation (Local Government Elections) (Scotland) Bill - Stage 
            1</strong>-That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of 
            the Proportional Representation (Local Government Elections) (Scotland) 
            Bill.</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3727.1</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: Proportional Representation 
              (Local Government Elections) (Scotland) Bill</strong>-As an amendment 
              to motion (S1M-3727) in the name of Tricia Marwick, <a name="AmendmentText">leave 
              out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the Local 
              Government Committee's Stage 1 Report on the Proportional Representation 
              (Local Government Elections) Bill and that any change to the election 
              system could not come into effect until the 2007 local government 
              elections at the earliest; further notes the publication by the 
              Scottish Executive of its <em>Local</em> <em>Governance (Scotland) 
              Bill</em> document which fulfils the commitments made to make progress 
              on electoral reform and deals with wider issues to encourage greater 
              participation in local government, and, with regard to the Proportional 
              Representations (Local Government Elections) Bill, therefore does 
              not agree to the general principles of this particular Bill for 
              the reason that its provisions demonstrably do not meet the extensive 
              requirements for renewing local democracy.&quot;</a></p>

              of Thimerosal in Vaccines</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
              with concern that thirteen vaccines currently available in the United 
              Kingdom, including four that are administered to children, contain 
              thimerosal, a compound 50% comprised of ethyl mercury and already 
              banned in the United States of America; further notes the fears 
              of a link between thimerosal and conditions such as autism and Alzheimer's 
              disease, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take steps 
              to eradicate thimerosal from vaccines available in Scotland and, 
              in the meantime, inform the public about the availability of vaccines 
              that do not contain thimerosal.</a> </p>
