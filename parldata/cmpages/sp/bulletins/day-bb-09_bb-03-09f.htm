<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on   which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments   lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin   every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the   forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment   is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first   published, that additional support is shown separately at the<a href="#end"> end of this   section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the   Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not   yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol   (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with   an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been   withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3640</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Congratulations   to FARE in the East End of Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates   Family Action in Rogerfield and Easterhouse (FARE), which has recently been   awarded a grant of &pound;334,988 from the Big Lottery Fund&rsquo;s Investing in Communities   project; is delighted that the money will be used to replace existing facilities   at FARE, with a new family community centre providing increased opportunities   for local families and residents to participate in a range of services including   youth clubs, homework clubs, family advocacy and the Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award   scheme; acknowledges with gratitude the continued hard work, dedication and   innovation that the young people and staff of FARE have brought to the east end   of Glasgow, and believes that this grant is a tribute to this work and to that   of Bob Holman who has dedicated so much to the people and communities of Greater   Easterhouse.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3639</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations   to GALVmed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the pioneering work that   Scottish charity the Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines   (GALVmed) is engaged in to make affordable livestock vaccines available to some   of the world&rsquo;s poorest livestock keepers in many of the Commonwealth states;   recognises that for millions of people, in many Commonwealth states, livestock   ownership provides a way to escape absolute poverty, and welcomes friends from   overseas who will attend the celebration on 11 March 2009 of the 10th   anniversary of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association including two members   of the Maasai community from northern Tanzania.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3638</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Scottish Solutions to   Scottish Problems</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns UK Government proposals   outlined in the Welfare Reform Bill, which it considers amount to the most   radical retrenchment of the benefit system in decades and will negatively affect   the most vulnerable benefit claimants in Scotland; believes that the draconian   measures outlined in the Bill will have hugely negative effects on those who are   unemployed and suffering under poverty in Scotland, particularly in areas with   high rates of deprivation like Glasgow; shares the concerns of leading UK civil   liberties group, Liberty, that provisions of the current Welfare Reform Bill   will seriously interfere with the privacy and anti-discrimination rights of   benefit claimants, particularly people who are drug dependent; agrees with the   former First Minister, Donald Dewar, that &quot;Scottish solutions to Scottish   problems&quot; should be sought, and, therefore, believes that the powers of the   Scottish Parliament should be extended to include welfare benefits in order to   ensure that Scotland does not suffer under these retrograde   proposals.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3637</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Bethany Christian   Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the difficult but rewarding work   carried out by Bethany Christian Trust for homeless and vulnerable people   throughout Scotland; notes that the Care Shelter provides emergency   accommodation in Edinburgh for people who need somewhere to sleep during the   winter months; further notes that the Care Shelter provided a bed and meal for   around 500 homeless people in 2007-08; recognises that this work is reliant on   the support of hundreds of volunteers and dozens of churches that are integral   to the running of the shelter, and urges MSPs to consider supporting the Bethany   Trust in this vital work.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3636</strong> <strong>Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>Free to Fly the   Flag</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils of Our Lady of the   Annunciation Primary School in Merrylee, Glasgow, on being awarded a green flag   under the eco-schools programme; notes that the school did not have a flagpole   from which to fly its green flag, and congratulates Centurion Signs Ltd, which   supplied and installed a flagpole for the school free of charge.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3634</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Labour&rsquo;s True   Beliefs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the views of Tom Harris, Labour MP   for Glasgow South, who, in response to hearing how proud a father was of his   daughter&rsquo;s newborn baby, stated in his blog &quot;But proud? Proud that his teenage   daughter was not only sexually active but was now a mother? Proud that any   chance of a decent education, followed by a decent job, was now remote at best?   Proud that she was, in all likelihood, about to embark on a lifetime of   depending on benefit handouts for her and her child?&quot;; considers sickening the   beliefs espoused by the MP when he stated that &quot;They become pregnant because   they have absolutely no ambition for themselves. They have been indoctrinated   with the lie that they&rsquo;ll never amount to anything, and have fulfilled that   prophesy by making no effort to achieve any qualification. Very often they live   with parents (or a parent) who have no jobs themselves, who are setting the   example of benefit dependency for all their offspring&quot;; believes that such   right-wing and downright offensive language is completely indefensible, and   calls on the Labour party to sanction Tom Harris publicly and for the MP to   issue an immediate apology.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3617</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Snaring in   Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that it is now a full   year since the previous Minister for Environment announced his intention not to   ban snares but to create further regulations to govern their use; recognises   that the proposed regulations have not yet appeared; considers that, even with   regulation, the continued use of snaring will subject thousands of Scotland&rsquo;s   animals every year to distress and suffering, including disembowelment,   mutilation and death by slow strangulation, which is unacceptable and could not   legally be inflicted on domestic animals; also considers that indiscriminate   trapping methods such as snares exact a heavy toll on non-target animals,   including wildlife, pets and farmed animals; is concerned that snares are still   used to catch protected mountain hares; recognises that the Scottish Executive   consultation on the future of snaring in 2006 elicited a more than two-to-one   majority in favour of an outright ban on snares and that a poll commissioned in   October 2008 showed that 79% of the Scottish public thought that snares should   be banned, and therefore fully supports the campaign by Advocates for Animals,   the League Against Cruel Sports and other wildlife organisations in calling for   urgent action including a complete ban on snares in Scotland.</p>
