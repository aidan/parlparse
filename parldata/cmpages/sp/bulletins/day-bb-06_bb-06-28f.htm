<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4607*#*</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Hidden Price of Treatment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of Macmillan Cancer Support that, while the average cancer patient in the United Kingdom pays &pound;325 in travel and parking costs over the course of treatment, in Scotland this cost rises to &pound;636 as cancer patients travel on average 53 times to hospital for treatment, a situation which is exacerbated in rural areas such as the south of Scotland; further notes that, of the 70% of cancer patients who face extra costs to get treatment, only 22% receive financial help and, of these, only 4% receive help from existing government schemes; notes that this situation is compounded by an average loss of income of 50% as a direct result of cancer, and therefore considers that the Scottish government should review urgently the financial assistance available for travel costs and consider an exemption from hospital car parking charges for all who require repeat courses of treatment for cancer and other life-threatening conditions.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4601.1</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Race Equality</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4601) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;, condemns however the treatment of asylum seekers who after years in Scotland, often with children born in Scotland, can still be deported and while living here are prevented from seeking employment despite their wish to do so, and considers that this situation completely contradicts the Fresh Talent initiative and the culture of an inclusive Scotland which the Executive quite rightly seeks to promote.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4601.2</strong> <strong>Dave Petrie:</strong> <strong>Race Equality</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4601) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;supports Scottish Executive priorities&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the intention to support improved integration and understanding between all groups in the community, and urges the Scottish Executive to deliver tangible improvements in the lives of Scotland&rsquo;s diverse communities whilst ensuring resources are maximised and directed to best effect&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4577*#*</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Passengers Before Profits - Greater Accountability in Public Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament reiterates its strong view that decent local bus services are vital to all Scotland&rsquo;s communities and its belief that such services are integral to cutting road congestion and safeguarding the environment; welcomes the significant investment in bus infrastructure, including better terminuses, priority bus lanes and fast track traffic management systems which have received Scottish Executive support throughout Scotland; expresses significant concern that withdrawal of services is continuing resulting in, for example, a much poorer after-hours service in Glasgow, undermining investment and attempts to deliver more integrated and accessible health care and other public services, as well as leaving many areas of both urban and rural Scotland without adequate services, and *believes that* the Executive and Transport Scotland, in return for the increased investment, *should* ensure greater accountability of the bus industry for services across Scotland, *should* undertake speedily a review of how quality bus partnerships are operating and *should* consider seriously all possible options which could prevent the loss or absence of vital services, including new and greater forms of regulation such as franchise agreements or allowing the new Regional Transport Partnerships the power to determine routes and timetables, so as to guarantee all Scottish communities the bus links which they need and deserve.</p>
