            the recent announcement of a Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) to be established

            Advice Bureaux serving not only the Highlands and Islands but also 
            the rest of Scotland and notes that 90% of the workforce in these 
            bureaux are volunteers; congratulates Argyll and Bute Council, the 
            Community Fund and Citizens Advice Scotland on their partnership approach 
            to delivering the necessary funding, and looks forward to the provision 
            of a wide range of previously unavailable advice on consumer protection

            Day on 25 November 2001 and supports the Blow the Whistle on Violence 
            Against Women event on that day; further notes that the White Ribbon 
            is the international symbol of hope for a world where women and girls 
            can live free from the fear of violence; recognises the difficulty 
            Womankind Worldwide has had in finding a Scottish distributor for 
            white ribbons this year, and hopes that this problem will be rectified 
            in time for next year&#146;s White Ribbon Day to help highlight the 
            problem of violence against women and the cost of this to society.

          <p> <strong>S1M-2475</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Kincaidston Primary 
            School - British Sign Language</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            Kincaidston Primary School in South Ayrshire for its commitment to 
            teaching British Sign Language; notes that Primary Seven pupils already 
            have a basic knowledge; further notes that 48 local adults have enrolled 
            in classes which can lead to recognised qualifications, and commends 
            the staff, pupils and parents for their efforts.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2474#</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant: Relocation of Scottish 
            Natural Heritage</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
            intention to review the location of Scottish Natural Heritage; further 
            notes the progress made by the Executive to disperse public agencies 
            and civil service jobs away from Edinburgh, and considers that the 
            Executive should move Scottish Natural Heritage to the Highlands, 
            an area with which it is particularly closely associated. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2473#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Moratorium on Sea 
            Cage Fish Farming</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the responsibility 
            of government to comply with Directive 2000/60/EC of the European 
            Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework 
            for Community action in the field of water policy (the Water Framework 
            Directive) in maintaining the quality of rivers, lochs and coastal 
            waters; further notes concerns regarding aquaculture-related environmental 
            impacts voiced in the Transport and the Environment Committee&#146;s 
            inquiry into caged fish farming, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should instigate a moratorium on the further expansion of intensive, 
            large scale sea-cage fish farming until such time as the environmental 
            carrying capacity of Scotland&#146;s aquatic environment for aquaculture 
            activity has been comprehensively determined, such a moratorium to 
            exclude the undertaking of sea cage fish farming at new sites for 
            the purposes of good husbandry and mitigating environmental impact.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2472#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Promoting Aberdeen 
            as Europe's Energy Capital</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the City of Aberdeen&#146;s role as Europe&#146;s oil and gas capital 
            and the long-term contribution that the offshore sector will continue 
            to make to the Scottish economy; believes that every effort should 
            be made to ensure that the city evolves into Europe&#146;s &quot;Energy 
            Capital&quot; thereby benefiting from the industry&#146;s enormous 
            economic and environmental potential that can place Scotland in the 
            vanguard of renewable energy business internationally; considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should produce specific strategies aimed at 
            supporting Scotland&#146;s oil and gas sector and renewable energy 
            sector that also promote Aberdeen as Europe&#146;s energy capital, 
            and further considers that the Executive should promote measures to 
            ensure that, as far as possible, the new energy revolution is driven 
            by indigenous interests. </p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2471</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Atlantic Telecom 
            Collapse</strong>&#151;That the Parliament regrets the sudden withdrawal 
            of telephony services to thousands of Atlantic Telecom customers; 
            calls on the Group&#146;s administrators, in conjunction with the 
            creditors, to restore the telephony services until alternative acceptable 
            arrangements can be agreed, and further calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to make urgent representations to Her Majesty&#146;s Government, Oftel 
            and the telecommunications industry to resolve outstanding issues, 
            particularly the transfer of telephone numbers to the new service 
            providers.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2470</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Birthplace of 
            John Muir in Dunbar</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that the 
            proposals to gut the interior of John Muir&#146;s birthplace in Dunbar 
            and replace the internal structure with a modern one are controversial 
            and need wide public debate; notes with concern the reservations and 
            objections strongly expressed by the Scottish Civic Trust, the Muir 
            family, the Sierra Club and many others which seem to have been ignored; 
            questions the right of a small group of self appointed trustees to 
            make such a decision without much wider consultation; is surprised 
            by the decision of the Planning Committee of East Lothian Council 
            to pass the proposals, given the huge weight of objections from Scotland 
            and overseas compared to the very few indications of support; regards 
            the permission to alter a listed building subsequently given by the 
            Scottish Executive as hasty, and suggests to the Heritage Lottery 
            Fund that, giving the continuing controversy surrounding this matter, 
            a final decision on grant aid for the project is withheld pending 
            further consultation and discussion.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2468#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: North Channel 
            Ferry Crossing</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with regret that 
            Stena Line is to withdraw one ferry from the Stranraer to Belfast 
            route resulting in 92 job losses; welcomes, however, the feasibility 
            study being undertaken by Stena Line into creating new port facilities 
            in Loch Ryan and at Belfast with a view to decreasing crossing times 
            and increasing the daily number of sailings; recognises the importance 
            of the North Channel ferry traffic to the economy of Wigtownshire, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should come forward with 
            plans to upgrade the road infrastructure leading to the Loch Ryan 
            ports in a way which will complement the investment undertaken by 
            P &amp; O and Stena Line ferry companies.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2464</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Anti-Terrorism 
            Measures and the European Convention on Human Rights</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the concerns of human rights organisations such 
            as Amnesty International and the Scottish Human Rights Centre about 
            the implications of the measures outlined in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime 
            and Security Bill; notes that these measures involve derogation from 
            the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) by the UK and challenge 
            the right to trial and the 110 day rule; further notes the Parliament&#146;s 
            fundamental duty to comply with the ECHR and regrets that the United 
            Kingdom Parliament is not similarly constrained; is concerned at the 
            lack of an independent ECHR assessment to enable informed consideration 
            of the Sewel motion debated on 14 November 2001, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to make a commitment to the urgent establishment

            a Patients&#146; Council within the Royal Cornhill Hospital, Aberdeen 
            to promote user involvement in the shaping and delivery of mental 
            health services locally, thus ensuring that these services are truly 
            patient focussed; and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            support the Aberdeen Mental Health Reference Group and others in their 
            campaign to establish such a Patients&#146; Council by approving the 
            Millan Committee proposal that there be statutory funding for collective 
            advocacy services, in order to guarantee implementation in Aberdeen 
            and across the country.&quot;</a></p>
