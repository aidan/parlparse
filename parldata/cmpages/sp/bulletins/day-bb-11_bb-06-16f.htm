<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00326 Liam McArthur on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body: Membership of the Scottish Commission for Public Audit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body&rsquo;s proposal to appoint Colin Beattie, Alex Johnstone, Angus MacDonald and John Pentland to be members of the Scottish Commission for Public Audit.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00325 Richard Lyle: North Lanarkshire Council Surplus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament understands that North Lanarkshire Council made a surplus of over &pound;16.8 million pounds in the last financial year, the highest surplus in five years; therefore requests that the council reconsider the town centre parking charges that it is proposing to bring in as this proposal may cost jobs and cause shoppers to stay away from town centres in North Lanarkshire, and believes that the council should be encouraging businesses to locate in town centres and not penalising them.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00324 Fiona McLeod: Children&rsquo;s Laureate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Julia Donaldson on becoming the seventh, and first Scotland-based, Children&rsquo;s Laureate in recognition of her extensive work, including plays, poems, books and creating the much-loved Gruffalo character; supports her plan to bring drama and music to the role, inspiring children to act stories out and taking them from the page into their own lives, and wishes her well in the role.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00323 John Wilson: Camanachd Cearcall Lannraig A&rsquo;tuath Four Years on</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Camanachd Cearcall Lannraig A&rsquo;tuath (CCL) for its success in the Artemis Macaulay National Primary Sixes competition, which took place in Oban on 11 June 2011; applauds the CCL for winning its section, qualifying for their first semi-final and winning the Lochcarron Quaich (Best Girl Player) award for outstanding performance; praises the hard work and determination that it considers was shown by all those involved in this success, and wishes the CCL all the best for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00322 Jim Eadie: Early Detection of Breast Cancer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the progress in recent years in cutting cancer waiting times; expresses concern that a recent survey by Breakthrough Breast Cancer shows that awareness among women of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer is low across Scotland; recognises that an early diagnosis of breast cancer is vital for improving the chance of a successful outcome; welcomes Breakthrough Breast Cancer&rsquo;s Touch Look Check (TLC) campaign, which aims to improve levels of breast awareness, and looks forward to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Detect Cancer Early initiative being rolled out as quickly as possible in order to increase the number of cancers detected at an early stage.</p>

Resources Launch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Who am I? resources by the National Deaf Children&rsquo;s Society (NDCS) Scotland; notes that these resources have been produced as a result of project funding from the Big Lottery Fund, and that they have been developed over three years in partnership with 100 deaf children and their families throughout Scotland; welcomes the project&rsquo;s focus on creating a peer group for deaf children, mainly educated in mainstream environments, and encouraging them to share their experiences as they prepare to make what it hopes will be a successful transition to adulthood; is aware that the resources include the book, <em>Who am I?,</em> in which young deaf people share their stories, a parent-to-parent booklet with top tips for parents of deaf teenagers and the <em>Who am I?</em> DVD, which features five young deaf people from Scotland and their families talking about their lives and experiences; congratulates NDCS on producing these resources, which it understands will provide for the first time ever an insight into what it is like to be a young deaf person in Scotland today; commends these resources to other families of deaf children, deaf young people themselves and to the professionals working with them, and encourages all members to look at what it considers to be this invaluable resource.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00316 Kenneth Gibson: Syria&rsquo;s Assault on Innocent Civilians</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament strongly condemns the reported brutality and violence of the Syrian Ba&rsquo;athist dictatorship of President Bashar al-Assad and what it considers the barbaric and horrifying attacks on Syria&rsquo;s own innocent civilians protesting for democratic rights; is appalled at reports that the use of overwhelming force used has included helicopter gunships and tanks; deplores what it sees as the widespread human rights abuses from the regime in response to popular demonstrations for democracy; understands that there have been at least 1,590 deaths so far, over 10,000 arrests and widespread torture, as shown by the example of 13-year-old Hamza al-Khateeb, one of 82 reported cases of children killed in the violence, who was captured, brutally tortured, mutilated and murdered; recognises the growing refugee situation considered to have been created by the state&rsquo;s violence, with thousands of refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries, and strongly encourages governments and international bodies to use diplomatic and economic pressure to demand that the Syrian regime restrains its security apparatus and enters into dialogue with its own people about introducing real democratic change.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00315 Kenneth Gibson: Protecting the Wages of Agricultural Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board is proposing a 2.5% wage increase for minimum pay for agricultural workers resulting in an increase from &pound;6.51 to &pound;6.67 per hour for those with more than 26 continuous weeks of employment, from &pound;5.96 to &pound;6.11 for those in their first 26 weeks of employment and from &pound;3.61 to &pound;3.70 for new employees undertaking an apprenticeship; notes with concern calls from the Conservative Party to abolish the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board with, it considers, the aim of reducing wages, and condemns any policy that would further depress the wages and subsequently damage the living standards of people with some of the lowest wages of those employed in rural communities.</p>
