<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only  printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the  complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is  published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged  for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for  debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol  (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in  the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party  support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a  declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3911 Ms Sandra White: Women  Still Under-Represented&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament condemns unreservedly the  situation demonstrated by the figures contained in Who Runs Scotland 2006,  produced by the Equal Opportunities Commission Scotland; notes that, amidst a  welter of damning statistics, women make up only 22% of Scottish councillors,  10% of senior police officers and 18% of secondary school head teachers;  suggests that 30 years after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 came into force  the pace of change remains painfully slow, and calls on all bodies, both public  and private, to dismantle proactively age-old barriers and move forward to a  situation where this valuable national resource is utilised to the full.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3910 Mr Tom McCabe: The  Draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2005 Amendment (No.2) Order 2006&mdash;</strong>That the  Finance Committee recommends that the Draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2005 Amendment (No.2)  Order 2006 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3906&lt;&gt; Bill Butler: Sectarianism in Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the launch of  the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s 18-point Action Plan on Tackling Sectarianism which  will see the Executive support and expand the range of local and national  initiatives that emerged from the National Summit on Sectarianism, held in  February 2005; recognises that sectarianism is a problem throughout Scotland  and that it must be confronted; realises the importance of supporting  community-based projects, such as Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s Sense over  Sectarianism campaign and the twinning of denominational and non-denominational  schools, in challenging sectarian attitudes and improving young people&rsquo;s  understanding of each others&rsquo; cultural identities, and commends the efforts of  the Executive, local authorities, charities such as Nil By Mouth, churches and  community groups in highlighting the problems of bigotry and sectarianism which  exist within communities and workplaces throughout Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3904 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees  that the draft Police Act 1997 Amendment (Scotland) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George  Lyon*</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3903 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees  that the draft Budget (Scotland)  Act 2005 Amendment Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George  Lyon*</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3902# Mr Duncan McNeil: Greenock  Telegraph Brighter Smiles Campaign&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament acknowledges the  importance of ensuring that children get into the habit of regular visits to  the dentist at as early an age as possible; expresses concern that some 5,300  children and young people in Inverclyde are not registered with a dentist; notes  that this amounts to approximately one-third of the children in the area;  further notes that research by Greenock&rsquo;s Phoenix Community Health Project  found that parents were unsure about where, when and with whom to register a  child, and therefore congratulates the Greenock Telegraph for running a  very successful, high-profile campaign to get local children signed up with a  dentist and on the road to better oral health throughout their lives.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3901 Mr David Davidson: The  Road User Charging Schemes (Keeping of Accounts and Relevant Expenses)  (Scotland) Regulations 2005&mdash;</strong>That the Local Government and Transport  Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Road User Charging  Schemes (Keeping of Accounts and Relevant Expenses) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 (SSI  2005/654).</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3900 Mr David Davidson: The  Road User Charging (Penalty Charges) (Scotland) Regulations 2005&mdash;</strong>That the  Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that nothing further be  done under the Road User Charging (Penalty Charges) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 (SSI  2005/652).</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3899 Mr David Davidson: The  Road User Charging (Liability for Charges) (Scotland) Regulations 2005&mdash;</strong>That  the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that nothing further be  done under the Road User Charging (Liability for Charges) (Scotland)  Regulations 2005 (SSI 2005/651).</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3898 Alasdair Morgan: The  Future of the Saltire&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern recent calls  for the Saltire to be replaced as the national flag of Scotland and its  misappropriation by far right groups in the United States of America; considers  the Saltire to be a powerful symbol of Scotland&rsquo;s identity; further notes the  comments of the Lord Lyon, Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, in 1956 that, &ldquo;The  Cross of St Andrew is the flag which any Scotsman [or woman] is entitled to fly  or wear as evidence of his [or her] national identity&rdquo;, and believes that the  Saltire is an internationally recognised symbol of Scotland with which all  modern Scots, regardless of origin or belief, can associate.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3897 Mr Mark Ruskell: UK  Government Report - Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes  the report, Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change, published by the UK  Government Meteorological Office and endorsed by the Prime Minister;notes  that this report updates the science of climate change since the Third  Assessment Report of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  was published in 2001; notes with grave concern the report&rsquo;s findings that  melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and shutting down of the Atlantic  Gulf Stream may be triggered by temperature rises within the 1.6 to 5.8C range  which are predicted for the next century; further notes the Prime Minister&rsquo;s  foreword which states, &ldquo;It is clear from the work presented that the risks of  climate change may well be greater than we thought. It is now plain that the  emission of greenhouse gases, associated with industrialisation and economic  growth from a world population that has increased six-fold in 200 years, is  causing global warming at a rate that is unsustainable&rdquo;, and calls on the Scottish  Executive to ensure that the review of its Climate Change Programme is further  strengthened, given the seriousness of these findings, and that it brings  forward a programme that will reduce Scotland&rsquo;s carbon dioxide emissions  year-on-year in line with a national target of 60% reductions by 2050.</p>
