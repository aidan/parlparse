            <strong>Pauline McNeill: Clyde Shipyard Workers</strong>—That the Parliament 
            extends its support to the Clyde shipyard workers in their fight to 
            obtain a £6 billion warship order, saving 500 jobs at Scotstoun and 
            generating up to 1,000 additional jobs in Glasgow; welcomes the commitment 
            of the Scottish Executive in its efforts to secure this lifeline contract 
            for the BAe Systems marine yards, and calls upon Her Majesty’s Government 
            to do all it can to secure the future of Clyde shipbuilding. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2018#</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: 
            National Refugee Week</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes the valuable 
            contribution made over the years by people fleeing from oppression 
            and danger in other countries to the life, diversity and achievements 
            of the United Kingdom, and of Scotland in particular; congratulates 
            the organisers of National Refugee Week, 23-29 June, for establishing 
            a UK-wide celebration of the role that refugees have in our national 
            culture; recognises the importance of all political representatives 
            taking a responsible stance on the matter of refugees and asylum seekers; 
            abhors any kind of violence or prejudice against refugees as an affront 
            to traditional Scottish hospitality and tolerance; is concerned at 
            the problems with housing, employment, the discriminatory voucher 
            system and bureaucracy which afflict asylum seekers, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should do everything in its power to ensure 
            that refugees are made warmly welcome in Scotland.</font></p>
