            Nuclear Fuels plc is considering building a new reactor at the site 
            of the existing nuclear power station at Chapelcross near Annan when 
            that station is decommissioned; offers its fullest support for the 
            proposal, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide whatever 
            support it can in developing the proposal to a successful conclusion.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2307</strong> <strong>Angus MacKay: Scottish Local

            the general principles of the Scottish Local Government (Elections) 
            Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2306</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: Balmerino Village</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates Balmerino in North East Fife on winning 
            the Lady Jane Grosvenor Cup for Best Wee Village in Scotland in the 
            Beautiful Scotland in Bloom Competition 2001 and, in particular, praises 
            the efforts of the Balmerino 2000 group and the residents of Balmerino 
            whose hard work and dedication has been rightly rewarded.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2305#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie: Scottish Huntington's 
            Association</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges the extreme 
            suffering caused by Huntingdon&#146;s disease, both to sufferers themselves 
            and to their families; recognises that improvement in services to 
            help people cope with the effects of the disease is vital, and congratulates 
            the Scottish Huntingdon&#146;s Association for their recent and highly 
            successful reception held at the Scottish Parliament. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2304#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Foot-and-Mouth 
            Disease-Free Status</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes confirmation 
            that tests on 22,828 sheep on 144 farms across Dumfries and Galloway 
            and the Borders between 16 August and 7 September 2001 have all proved 
            negative; further welcomes the granting of provisionally foot-and-mouth 
            disease-free status to the whole of Scotland; notes with concern that 
            some rights of way remain closed and believes that local authorities, 
            the State Veterinary Service, landowners and the Scottish Executive 
            Environment and Rural Affairs Department should work together to remove 
            all restrictions on rights of way as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2303</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Project Ability</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the excellent work of Project Ability, Glasgow, 
            in creating opportunities for disabled people to gain access to the 
            visual arts since 1984; further recognises the excellent work undertaken 
            by Project Ability&#146;s Centre for Developmental Arts since 1991 
            and its innovative workshop programme that supports people with learning 
            disabilities in taking an active part in national and international 
            arts events, and wishes the centre all the very best on its 10th anniversary.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2302#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Introduction 
            of a Pollution Inventory</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Scottish Executive on its proposals to cut particle air pollution 
            by more than 50% by 2010; notes the detrimental effects on health 
            that air pollution can have; recognises the need for the introduction 
            of a pollution inventory system in order to make information on releases 
            of pollutants from industrial processes available to the public in 
            a clear, easily understandable and accessible format, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should support the progressive introduction 
            of a pollution release and transfer register as required under the 
            United Nations Economic Commission for Europe&#146;s Aarhus convention.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2301#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Save Milngavie 
            Reservoir</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned at the plan by 
            West of Scotland Water Authority to build Scotland&#146;s largest 
            ever treatment works at the Milngavie Reservoir, a development which 
            would be the equivalent to building five football pitches to the height 
            of a four storey building on the brow of a hill; notes that Milngavie 
            Reservoir is a place of significant cultural and historic value to 
            both Milngavie and Glasgow, with the entire site having been listed 
            by Historic Scotland; is aware that the reservoir has been recognised 
            as a location of importance to nature conservation; is angered at 
            the totally inadequate level of public consultation by the authority 
            on the project with plans presented to the local community as virtually 
            a fait accompli; is further concerned at the secrecy surrounding the 
            project and the failure of the authority to provide satisfactory justification 
            on either technical or environmental grounds for selecting Milngavie 
            Reservoir over 17 other possible sites; believes that the plans for 
            the reservoir deprive the citizens of Milngavie and Glasgow of a much 
            loved and used public amenity in an area of outstanding natural beauty 
            set in the grandeur of a Victorian architectural setting; supports 
            the &quot;Friends of Milngavie Reservoir&quot; campaign against this 
            proposal by West of Scotland Water Authority, and calls for an immediate 
            halt to the project to enable other possible sites to be fully, properly 
            and publicly evaluated.</p>

          <p><strong>*S1M-2300#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Rosyth - Zeebrugge 
            Ferry Service</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that the process 
            to secure appropriate funding, including a freight facilities grant, 
            to support a direct ferry service between Rosyth and Zeebrugge is 
            at a crucial and sensitive stage; believes that the introduction of 
            this service is even more vital because of the expected downturn in 
            the Scottish economy in terms of both trade and travel impacts, and 
            therefore considers that the Scottish Executive as a matter of urgency 
            should use all the resources and persuasive powers at its disposal 
            to see this project through to a positive conclusion.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2299#</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Children in 
            Scotland/UNICEF, Children's Rights Audit</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the publication of the <i>Children&#146;s Rights Audit </i>compiled 
            by Children in Scotland and UNICEF which provides an overview of Scottish 
            Executive and Parliamentary activity in relation to children and young 
            people in the context of objectives set by the Scottish Executive 
            and in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; further notes, 
            that, while the Audit commends the breadth and depth of children&#146;s 
            policy activity undertaken, applauds the fact that the UN Convention 
            is gaining increased currency in political discussions and is supportive 
            of the consensual approach in Parliamentary debates, it also highlights 
            areas for improvement and in particular recommends that a children&#146;s 
            agenda should be brought together for Scotland which is based on key 
            principles and outcomes to then bring together a range of objectives 
            and targets, that the Child Strategy Statement should be strengthened 
            by making it pro-active with monitoring and public reporting, that 
            the involvement of children and young people in the national policy 
            making process needs to be meaningful and systematic and that young 
            people&#146;s own issues such as a national strategy for youth cafes/facilities 
            should be placed on the political agenda, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should actively address these issues.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2298</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Nurse Career Development 
            and Training</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns the widespread 
            practice in the NHS of making nurses undertake career development 
            and training in their own time and at their own expense and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive and the health authorities to ensure that 
            all nurse career development and training, and associated leave, is 
            fully funded.</p>
