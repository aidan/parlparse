          <p><strong>*S1M-2646#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Secondary 
            Schools Staffing Levels</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the decision of Glasgow City Council to introduce a new method of 
            calculating staffing levels at secondary schools in Glasgow involving 
            staffing schools on an average pupil roll across the year whereby, 
            for example, if there are 800 pupils in August and a projected 750 
            in January following the departure of January school leavers the school 
            will be staffed for 775 pupils from August; notes that no other local 
            authority uses this practice; further notes that potentially 38 secondary 
            teaching posts could be lost as a result, and therefore considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should make urgent representations to 
            Glasgow City Council against introducing this method of calculating 
            staffing levels.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2645</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Fergusson Art Gallery</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates Perth and Kinross Council on its allocation 
            of £75,000 towards the preservation of a well-known local landmark, 
            the cast iron dome of the Fergusson Art Gallery in Perth, and calls 
            upon Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund to show a favourable 
            response to grant applications seeking to raise the additional funds 
            required to preserve this important building for future generations 
            to enjoy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2644</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety: The Children's 
            Hearings (Legal Representation) (Scotland) Rules 2001</strong>-That 
            the Education, Culture and Sport Committee recommends that nothing 
            further be done under the Children's Hearings (Legal Representation) 
            (Scotland) Rules 2001 (SSI 2001/478).</p>

            2001</strong>-That the Education, Culture and Sport Committee recommends 
            that nothing further be done under the Panels of Persons to Safeguard 
            the Interests of Children (Scotland) Regulations 2001 (SSI 2001/476).</p>
          <p>Supported by: Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2641</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Death of John 
            McGrath</strong>-That the Parliament notes with regret and sadness 
            the death of John McGrath; believes that he made an enormous contribution 
            to Scottish cultural and political life, particularly through his 
            work with the 7:84 Theatre Company, and conveys its condolences to 
            his family.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2640</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Recycling Target 
            for Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the Executive to

          <p><strong>*S1M-2639</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Social Firms 
            Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the growing success 
            of Social Firms Scotland and the valuable role played by initiatives 
            throughout the country such as Square One, which is a Scottish Association 
            for Mental Health project, and Printability in Aberdeen which provide 
            people who have history of health problems with training and employment 
            opportunities that may not otherwise be available; commends the many 
            service users and officials who dedicate their time to making these 
            charitable projects a success; believes that the provision of such 
            services greatly assists people in gaining the confidence and stability 
            that is required to lead normal lives, and urges local authorities 
            and the Scottish Executive to provide continued support for such initiatives</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2638</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Grandholm Bridge Closure, 
            Aberdeen</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continuing traffic 
            congestion in the north of Aberdeen; further notes the proposals from 
            Aberdeen City Council to address this congestion and the plan to close 
            Grandholm Bridge from July 2002, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to make representations to Aberdeen City Council to keep the Grandholm 
            Bridge open at least until the Western Peripheral Route is in operation.</p>
