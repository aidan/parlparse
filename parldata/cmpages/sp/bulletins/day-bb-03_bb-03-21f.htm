            (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4054</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Attack on Iraq</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament condemns the decision by Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to order Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces to join the United States 
            of America in the use of military force against Iraq; recognises that 
            this military action will result in the deaths and injury of both 
            innocent Iraqi civilians and United Kingdom servicemen and servicewomen; 
            recognises that such military action is contrary to international 
            law and has undermined the authority of the United Nations; believes 
            that such unilateral action is weakening the international coalition 
            against terrorism and will result in increased support for terrorist 
            groups whose intention is to act against civilians in the United Kingdom 
            and in other countries, and calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to disengage Her Majesty&#146;s forces from hostilities against Iraq, 
            to ensure in the meantime everything is done to minimise the number 
            of civilian casualties resulting from this military action, particularly 
            those caused by the use of cluster bombs, depleted-uranium armaments 
            and landmines and to ensure that humanitarian relief is provided immediately 
            upon the cessation of hostilities.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4053</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Closure of Rankin 
            Maternity Unit at Inverclyde Royal Hospital</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament notes the comments of Inverclyde GP Dr Mustafa Kapasi in 
            the <em>Big Issues in Scotland </em>for 13 to 19 March 2003, in relation 
            to the threatened closure of the 29-bed Rankin Maternity Unit at Greenock's 
            Inverclyde Royal Hospital, that the closure plan was a "farce" and 
            that "the maternity unit should remain in Inverclyde &#133; It has 
            the best safety record in Scotland. Paisley is a run-down hospital 
            and for patients to be travelling 20-40 miles to reach it is a disaster"; 
            further notes that GPs from both Inverclyde and Paisley unanimously 
            voted in favour of the unit remaining in Greenock, and therefore resolves 
            to support the local community and medical campaign to save the Rankin 
            Maternity Unit from closure.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4052</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Imposition of 
            Pay Deal on Fire Service Personnel</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            condemns the Deputy Prime Minister&#146;s intention to impose a pay 
            deal on fire service personnel in England and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to refuse to follow this route and instead properly fund 
            the fire service&#146;s pay claim and allow a free and negotiated 
            settlement.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4051</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Hampden National 
            Stadium Sports Health and Injury Clinic</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            congratulates all associated with the multi-sport Hampden National 
            Stadium sports health and injury clinic charitable trust, whose members 
            are the Scottish Football Association, University of Glasgow, Strathclyde 
            University and Glasgow Caledonian University, which was formally opened 
            by Sir Alex Ferguson on Thursday 20 March 2003; notes that the official 
            opening took place almost a year from when the clinic first began 
            offering the very best in sports medicine treatment and facilities 
            to the public seven days a week; believes that the clinic serves as 
            a national resource and focus for research and educational activity 
            within sport and exercise medicine fitness and provides specialised 
            equipment and access for athletes with disabilities and that the vast 
            majority of clients to the clinic have been sportsmen and women who 
            exercise for fun and for health; recognises the contribution of the 
            clinic as an important addition to the sporting facilities of the 
            whole region and in developing expertise in sports medicine, and encourages 
            private and public support for the clinic. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4050</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: The Current International 
            Situation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament deeply regrets the commencement 
            of military action in Iraq; believes that the failure to settle this 
            crisis by peaceful means will have long-term repercussions for world 
            security and peace; recognises the overwhelming strength of feeling 
            in Scotland that opposes such action; further recognises that Scottish 
            servicemen and women are now involved in this action and extends its 
            support to them and their families at this time; demands that every 
            effort must be made to protect the civilian population of Iraq from 
            direct military threat, from starvation and from the consequences 
            of disease and hardship caused by the destruction of civil infrastructure 
            such as water treatment and power plants, and calls for this conflict 
            to be brought to a speedy conclusion.</p>
