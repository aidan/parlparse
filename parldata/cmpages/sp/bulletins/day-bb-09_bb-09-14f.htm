<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4840</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>National Eligibility Criteria for Adult Social Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the contents of the draft guidelines, <em>National Eligibility for Adult Social Care and Waiting Times for Personal and Nursing Care</em>, which it considers will have an adverse impact on preventative services for disabled adults; notes the problems that have been experienced by disabled adults in accessing support services in Edinburgh; is concerned that the guidelines are based on the current working practices of many local authorities across Scotland, which were themselves based on the UK Government&rsquo;s<em> Fair Access to Care Services</em>; notes that <em>Fair Access to Care Services</em> was originally devised to decide the eligibility for support of older people with progressive age-related incapacity and loss of independence and not for disabled adults for whom it considers access to care is about the right to independence, and believes that the needs of adults requiring social care would be better served if there was guidance on free personal and nursing care and new guidance dealing with the community care services provided under different legislation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4839</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to HEROtsc</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates HEROtsc in being short listed for the award of Outsourcing Contact Centre Provider of the Year by the National Outsourcers&rsquo; Association; notes the dedication of management and staff at its centres at Larbert, Kilmarnock and Dunoon, and wishes HEROtsc well at the awards ceremony in London.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4838</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Funding for Adam Smith College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the allocation by the Scottish Funding Council of &pound;1,442,740 to Adam Smith College, Kirkcaldy, as part of the &pound;12 million further education funding aimed at areas with high unemployment; acknowledges that this marks a 12% increase in Adam Smith College&rsquo;s income; commends the contribution by the Scottish Funding Council, designed to allow colleges to invest in building and equipment for learning and teaching, and welcomes the fact that the funding will contribute to the college&rsquo;s investment in a brand-new &pound;16 million facility for engineering, construction and science.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4837</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Asylum Seekers, Victims of Bankers&rsquo; Incompetence?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the United Kingdom&rsquo;s history of offering asylum to those people fleeing abuse and persecution, such as those escaping Nazi Germany, the Pinochet regime in Chile, the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iraq; believes that any nation that would call itself civilised should welcome such vulnerable people and offer them every opportunity to live decently, integrate themselves into society and contribute to it; believes that by not allowing asylum seekers to work and, from October 2009, forcing all single asylum seekers to live on only &pound;5 a day while attempting to surmount the complex hurdles put in their way by the UK Border Agency, the UK Government is making these often traumatised and stigmatised individuals pay the price of the incompetence of well-paid bankers who have no experience of living on &pound;5 a day, far less of rape, torture and genocide, and so is shamefully in breach of its duty of care; notes that this is happening at a time when the number of immigrants and asylum seekers is declining; welcomes comments by representatives of the Scottish Refugee Council, Oxfam Scotland and the British Red Cross criticising the UK Government&rsquo;s treatment of asylum seekers, and calls on the UK Government urgently to review its policies in this respect.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4836</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Homeless World Cup Milano 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates and supports the 48 nations and 500 players who are seeking &quot;fast goals, true grit and and glory&quot; at the Arena Civica Sempione Park in Milan for the 7th Homeless World Cup; recognises that &quot;everyone needs to wake up in the morning with a goal&quot; and that the Homeless World Cup provides the opportunity for homeless people and volunteers to get involved and help achieve their personal goals; further recognises the power of football to unite, and wishes every participant the best of luck during the event.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4791#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Highway Robbery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the growing trend for parking enforcement in private car parks and the vast amounts of money being taken from drivers in this regard, including in Coatbridge town centre; recognises that, while it may be legal for companies to charge for the use of their land for parking with appropriate planning consents, there is growing concern that many so-called fines for breaches of private parking rules are neither reasonable nor reflect a fair recompense for loss of business; notes that the law surrounding this issue is the common law of contract, involving companies making their offer by prominently and clearly displaying signs indicating that the relevant car parks are private property requiring payment or subject to time limitations, with the acceptance of the contract being implied by the client&rsquo;s parking there; further notes that such offer and acceptance would require to be tested in a civil court if disputed; is disturbed by the apparent ease with which car parking companies can access the private details of car owners from the DVLA&rsquo;s vehicle database to then issue fines to people at their home addresses; agrees with the recent comments by the Automobile Association that &quot;the prevalence of bad and immoral practices is now shocking and unacceptable&quot;, and condemns the often threatening and predatory manner in which these modern-day highway robbers pursue payment of these charges.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4580#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Whithorn as Cradle of Christianity and Place of Modern Pilgrimage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that Whithorn is the earliest known centre of Christianity in Scotland and that Whithorn has already produced archaeological artefacts of immense historical significance; notes that, while in ancient times Ninian was Scotland&rsquo;s premier saint and remains commemorated in many sites throughout the nation, the historical significance of Whithorn and Ninian&rsquo;s story is largely forgotten by a modern generation; recognises that the recognition of Whithorn as Scotland&rsquo;s cradle of Christianity will bring economic benefit to a depressed area, and supports the efforts of the Whithorn Trust to publicise Whithorn&rsquo;s unique contribution to Scottish history more widely, not least for the benefit of its present-day inhabitants.</p>
