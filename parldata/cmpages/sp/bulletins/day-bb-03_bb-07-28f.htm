          <P><strong>*S2M-235</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Johnstone 
            Hospital</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the demographic changes 
            taking place within Scotland mean both an increase in the elderly 
            population and an increase in demand for elderly services, especially 
            within the NHS; notes that, as a result, there will be an increase 
            in demand for elderly care beds within the NHS, but that Argyll and 
            Clyde NHS Board is proposing to close Johnstone Hospital and cut beds 
            for elderly people; recognises that this proposal is despite massive 
            opposition in the local community; demands that the board listens 
            to local people and reverses the decision to cut 163 elderly care 
            beds in the board's area; considers that the real reason for these 
            cuts is the need to pay back £30 million of debt which the board has 
            accumulated; affirms that, after working all their lives and paying 
            for the NHS, elderly people deserve better from both the board and 
            the Scottish Parliament, and therefore calls on the Minister for Health 
            and Community Care to guarantee the future of Johnstone Hospital.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-234</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>United 
            Kingdom Cabinet Should Resign</strong>-That the Parliament sends condolences 
            to the family of Dr David Kelly; considers his death to be another 
            waste of human life, in addition to the deaths of over 7000 civilians 
            caused by the unjustified and continuing slaughter of the war and 
            occupation of Iraq; recognises that the declared justification for 
            war by the Blair-led Government has been shown to have no credibility 
            whatsoever; further recognises that the real aims of the war were 
            to achieve domination of Iraq and all its resources and to annex the 
            oilfields for the benefit of the American Government and its multi-billion 
            dollar corporate backers; calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise 
            that it was misled by Her Majesty's Government and declare that it 
            was wrong to support the war; calls on the whole discredited United 
            Kingdom cabinet who championed the drive to war, including the Prime 
            Minister, to resign, and calls for the immediate withdrawal of all 
            British forces from the region and the immediate return of Iraq's 
            resources to the Iraqi people and for reparations to be paid for the 
            desperate loss of life, injury and destruction of Iraq's infrastructure.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Colin Fox<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-233</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Return 
            of Troops from Black Watch Regiment</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the return of soldiers from the Black Watch Regiment to their base 
            in Germany after their service during the conflict in Iraq; thanks 
            them for their service to this country and the people of Iraq; appreciates 
            their gesture to the people of Tayside and Fife in parading through 
            towns in Angus, Perth and Kinross and Fife, and wishes them a well-deserved 
            period of leave with their families.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-232</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Draft 
            Code of Recommendations for the Welfare of Livestock: Cattle (SE/2003/175)</strong>-That 
            the Environment and Rural Development Committee recommends that the 
            Draft Code of Recommendations for the Welfare of Livestock: Cattle 
            (SE/2003/175) be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P>*<strong>S2M-231</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The 
            Draft Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (Consequential 
            Modification) Order 2003</strong>-That the Health Committee recommends 
            that the draft Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 
            (Consequential Modification) Order 2003 be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-230</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Child 
            Injury Prevention</strong>-That the Parliament notes the extent of 
            accidents causing injury to children and figures recorded at Yorkhill 
            Children's Hospital in 2001 which show that 70% of injuries happen 
            whilst playing; further notes that many such accidents are preventable; 
            applauds the work of Dr NV Doraiswamy, accident and emergency consultant 
            at Yorkhill Children's Hospital, and the Health Promotion Office of 
            Greater Glasgow NHS Board on the Finger Tips safety leaflet, which 
            highlights fingers as being amongst the most mobile parts of a child's 
            body and, as such, vulnerable to being crushed or jammed, sometimes 
            resulting in amputation; believes that the use of simple devices, 
            including doorstoppers or specially insulated doorframes, can prevent 
            such injuries in the home, in schools and in public buildings, and 
            recognises that the Children's Hospital Injury Reporting and Prevention 
            Programme, known as CHIRPP, can assist in raising awareness about 
            the extent and type of accidents or injuries amongst children so that 
            forms of prevention may be identified.</P>
