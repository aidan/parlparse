          <p><strong>*S1M-2696</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Cost of Private 
            Finance Initiative Projects</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            with concern that the cost to the taxpayer of Private Finance Initiative 
            projects may increase several fold between the selection of the &quot;preferred 
            bidder&quot; and the signing of the final contract and requests that 
            Her Majesty&#146;s Government withdraw its opposition to the European 
            Union draft directive on consolidated procurement which would ban 
            the selection of preferred bidders before a contract has been developed 
            and prevent inflation of project costs.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2695#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Election of 
            Mr Afif Safieh as Honorary President of the Glasgow University Dialectic 
            Society</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Mr Afif Safieh, 
            Palestinian General Delegate to the United Kingdom, on his successful 
            election as Honorary President of the Glasgow University Dialectic 
            Society, on the basis of his presentation to the Society during the 
            2000-01 academic year, and welcomes the action of the Dialectic Society 
            as progressing the understanding in this country of the plight of 
            the Palestinian people, particularly at this time of great instability 
            and threat to the Palestinian Authority by the actions of the Israeli 
            Government.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2694#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Fife Council 
            and Third Age Group</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that it 
            is a matter of public record that Fife Council paid a total of £40,178 
            from 1998 to 1999 to the Third Age Centre in Glenrothes at a time 
            when it was no longer a properly constituted organisation; further 
            notes that the first employee of the Third Age Group was a serving 
            Fife Labour councillor, the second employee was a Labour activist 
            and that the Council's link worker with the Group was the election 
            agent to the MP, Henry McLeish; is concerned that all the papers relating 
            to the grant applications were shredded by the Council; considers 
            that the report of 4 December 2001 by Douglas Sinclair, the Council's 
            Chief Executive, which contained the following extracts&#151;</p>
          <p><em>&quot;The Third Age Centre was a properly constituted voluntary 
            organisation...and merited financial support from the Council&quot;;</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;&#133;it would appear that all normal procedures were followed 
            when processing the Group's applications for grant&quot;;</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;&#133;it was necessary to destroy the files as insufficient 
            storage space was available&quot;;</em></p>
          <p><em>&quot;&#133;that the Council's actions with regard to the Third 
            Age Group are beyond reproach&quot;</em> ; and </p>
          <p><em>&quot;No further action requires to be taken</em>.<em>&quot;</em></p>
          <p>calls into question the ability of the Council to investigate this 
            matter further in a manner which will satisfy the people of Fife, 
            and therefore considers that Audit Scotland should carry out an investigation 
            as a matter of urgency which should consider the Council's conduct 
            in relation to the Third Age Centre during the period 1995 to 2000 
            when grant assistance was being paid and conduct a thorough review 
            of the practices currently employed by the Council.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2693</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: British Winter 
            Olympic Team</strong>&#151;That the Parliament extends its best wishes 
            to the 51 members of the Great Britain team participating in the 2002 
            Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, particularly to the 19 Scottish 
            members who are involved in events such as skiing, curling, snowboarding 
            and the biathlon.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David Mundell<strong>*</strong>, Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2692</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: Ayr United Football 
            Stadium</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive's 
            abandonment of its appeal against Heritage Scotland Ltd&#146;s planning 
            consent for Ayr United's new football stadium with related development, 
            as granted by South Ayrshire Council and supported by the findings 
            of the Scottish Executive initiated public inquiry, and urges the 
            Scottish Executive to now record its approval for this consent, thereby 
            allowing the building of the new stadium to be commenced at the earliest 
            possible date.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2691</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Scottish Public 
            Service Employees</strong>&#151;That the Parliament has every confidence 
            in Scottish public service employees and acknowledges their integrity 
            and commitment to the efficient and effective provision of a vast 
            range of public services; notes their readiness to adapt to changing 
            circumstances and willingness to improve services especially when 
            such changes are based upon genuine consultation, and believes that 
            many of the individual and communal needs and requirements in both 
            urban and rural communities are best met by services, utilities and 
            resources which are retained in the public sector and managed and 
            staffed by those who have a sympathetic understanding of, and engagement 
            with, a public service ethos.</p>
