<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1769</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>St Stephen&rsquo;s High School, Port Glasgow, Scottish Winners of Schools Question Time Challenge 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Stephen&rsquo;s High School which has reached the final stage of the Schools Question Time Challenge for 2008; notes that the Inverclyde school is the only Scottish school in the final and now has the chance to produce a special Question Time programme to be aired on the BBC this summer; also notes this is the second year running that the school has won the Scottish section of the competition, and acknowledges that the school won its place in the final by applying for a citizenship education pack which helped it write a proposal showing how it would stage the event with details of the panel it intended to approach and topics to be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1768</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>International Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of preparing young people for life in today&rsquo;s increasingly globalised society; agrees that all our young people should have an international education with opportunities to develop a knowledge and understanding of the world and Scotland&rsquo;s place in it; congratulates the many schools across Scotland that have made and continue to make links with schools across the world, and agrees that the Curriculum for Excellence is the ideal vehicle to deliver international education in schools and equip young people with an understanding of, and the skills for, the modern world.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1767</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Quality Education to End Exclusion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes pupils from Aberdeen Grammar School, Abronhill High School, Boroughmuir High School, Dumfries Academy, Greenock Academy, Grove Academy and Stewart&rsquo;s Melville College to the Parliament on 24 April 2008 to debate the Education for All goals, as part of the Global Campaign for Education; acknowledges that while progress has been made, there are still 72 million children around the world who are missing out on a quality primary education; notes that millions of people are excluded from quality education for various reasons including conflict, poverty, gender, child labour, disability and geographical location; acknowledges the need for increased investment in those countries furthest from meeting the Education for All goals and for policies to address equity issues, and supports the efforts of the members of the Global Campaign for Education, including Save the Children, Oxfam in Scotland and the English-Speaking Union, in raising awareness of the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1766</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Scotland Not Best Served by British Airports Authority</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Scottish travelling public is not best served by the British Airports Authority (BAA) in its current form; calls for the monopoly operated by BAA to be broken up so that airline services in Scotland can be improved by creating a market place where direct flights become the norm rather than the few currently available from BAA airports, and further calls for this action in order to reduce wasteful double flights, landing charges and taxes which add not only extra expense and inconvenience to the travelling public but disadvantage Scottish commerce and industry while at the same time causing greater environmental damage than direct flights.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1765</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Scottish Register of Tartans Bill at Stage 1 be completed by 13 June 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1764</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Public Health etc. (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 be completed by 23 May 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1763</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1761</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Tigerfest &lsquo;08</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scotland-wide music festival, Tigerfest &lsquo;08, being held throughout the month of May; notes that the festival is based in Dunfermline&rsquo;s Carnegie Hall, with satellite shows taking place in other cities throughout Scotland and that over 40 bands will be participating, and acknowledges the positive effect that this festival will have on the cultural wellbeing of people across Fife and visitors to the area.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1760#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>INEOS Reduction in Workforce Pensions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposal by INEOS to reduce the pension rights of the workforce at the former BP oil refinery and chemicals complex at Grangemouth from those which had been part of the terms and conditions of employment of the workforce when INEOS bought the BP site; further notes that the INEOS proposal is to create a two-tier workforce with all new employees being denied a final salary pension and resulted in 97% of trade union members in an 86% ballot return voting for strike action after exhaustive negotiations; expresses concern at the aggressive tactics of INEOS senior management in undermining the agreed consultative processes, and supports the efforts of the INEOS workforce and its trade union, Unite, to sustain existing pension arrangements on this very profitable complex for the benefit of all current and future employees.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1759</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Scotland the What</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scotland the What stars, George Donald, Steven Robertson and Buff Hardie, on receiving the freedom of the city of Aberdeen; notes with appreciation the special brand of local humour that they brought to a global audience, and further notes the great work that they did in publicising not only Scotland but also the Doric dialect.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1758</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Innovative Methods for Tackling Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern recent news reports about the levels of violence in Scotland due to gang activity; further notes that many teens feel unsafe in their neighbourhoods and have resorted to carrying knives and other weapons for protection; believes that Scotland could learn from New York City how it was able to reduce its crime rates; commends Strathclyde Police based in Cumbernauld for using innovative methods such as the use of YouTube and Bebo to identify and track down gang members, and considers that by using these new technological innovations, along with looking at different models around the world, police can help to offer a safer and stronger Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1757</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Greater Glasgow Scouts Growing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the increase of almost 5% this year in the membership of the Scout movement in Greater Glasgow; notes the wide opportunities for adventurous pursuits, personal development and informal learning and the contribution to civic and community responsibility offered by the Scouts; is aware that this success, and indeed all the work of the Scouts and other youth organisations, could not be achieved without the commitment of young and adult volunteers and leaders, and looks for even further success in future years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1756</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Supporting People with Autism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent 40th anniversary of the Scottish Society for Autism and the first United Nations World Autism Awareness Day in April 2008; notes the progress that has been made in education for young people on the autistic spectrum, underpinned by the framework of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 and in services for both adults and children by the voluntary and statutory sectors; particularly applauds the work being undertaken by Glasgow City Council to help get people on the autistic spectrum into work but is hugely concerned at the proposals by the UK Government which insist on regular, routine reassessments of people with autism who are on disability benefits; believes that such routine reassessments will be counter-productive, worrying and damaging to people with profound autism, and urges the UK Government to adopt a more supportive approach to supporting people with autism into work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1755</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Evening Times War on Litter Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>Evening Times</em> for its War on Litter campaign; notes that War on Litter came runner-up for Campaign of the Year at the recent Scottish Press Awards; commends the <em>Evening Times</em> for the long-running campaign, particularly for its work in discouraging the dropping of litter and fly-tipping and encouraging civic pride throughout Glasgow, and recognises the role that the <em>Evening Times</em> has played in campaigning on behalf of the people of Glasgow to clean up the city.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1754</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Save the Rutherglen Royal Burgh House Caf&eacute;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the committed and passionate local campaigners who are fighting to save the community caf&eacute; at South Lanarkshire Council&rsquo;s Royal Burgh House in Rutherglen; notes that the caf&eacute; provides an important community facility, a friendly meeting place with reasonably priced food for many workers, locals and visitors to Rutherglen, including council employees, staff at the local police station and an elderly forum; further notes that the campaigners have collected over 700 signatures to date in opposition to the caf&eacute;&rsquo;s closure; praises the role played by the local newspaper, <em>The</em> <em>Rutherglen Reformer</em>, in helping bring the situation to the public&rsquo;s attention; welcomes the review recently announced by South Lanarkshire Council in relation to its previous decision to close the caf&eacute;, and calls on South Lanarkshire Council to ensure that any review is more than a delaying exercise, that it recognises the important community role provided by the caf&eacute; and that it brings forward a strategy designed to ensure that the caf&eacute; has a long-term future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1753</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Dame Vivienne Westwood</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament adds it congratulations to Dame Vivienne Westwood on the conferment of an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by Heriot-Watt University on 21 April 2008 in Galashiels in recognition of her outstanding achievement in fashion design over the last 30 years and her continuing contribution to textiles in Scotland, particularly through her long-standing association with the original Borders Textile College, now Heriot-Watt School of Textiles, at its Galashiels campus.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1751.1</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Historic Scotland and Local Authorities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1751) in the name of Linda Fabiani, insert at end &quot;and seeks a more compatible approach in relation to resolving disputes with stakeholders, particularly where Historic Scotland has no realistic means of funding its desired preservation or conservation outcomes&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1751.2</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Historic Scotland and Local Authorities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1751) in the name of Linda Fabiani, insert at end &quot;always ensuring that strong safeguards are maintained to protect heritage assets, that the skills required to maintain historic buildings are available and that, in protecting the historic environment, proper account is taken of disability rights and climate change objectives&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1751.3</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Historic Scotland and Local Authorities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1751) in the name of Linda Fabiani, insert at end &quot;and encourages Historic Scotland to work with local authorities to improve the consultation with local communities on the designation of listed buildings and scheduled monuments&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1728</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Approach to Biofuel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the urgency of the climate change issue and understands that this urgency has driven international moves to back biofuels; however, notes the <em>Losing Ground</em> report published by Friends of the Earth and LifeMosaic which sets out the social and environmental costs often associated with biofuel plantations in the developing world; acknowledges the concerns of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and others that wholesale moves to biofuel crops can jeopardise biodiversity both overseas through loss of rainforest and in Scotland through economic pressures leading to loss of field margins and reduced set-aside land; further notes the comments from the UK&rsquo;s Chief Scientific Adviser that the current approach to biofuels is insufficiently sustainable; recognises that Scottish-grown biofuel crops are often transported significant distances for processing, leading to increased carbon emissions; notes the risk to food prices at home and abroad associated with increased use of agricultural land for fuel crops, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that Scottish measures to comply with the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation are consistent with real cuts in carbon emissions and with both social justice and economic sustainability in Scotland and across the developing world.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1728.1</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Approach to Biofuel</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1728) in the name of Patrick Harvie, after &quot;for fuel crops,&quot; insert &quot;but recognises the valuable role to be played by co-digestion plants, such as those in Westray, in Orkney, and Turiff, in producing fuel and energy from animal waste, and urges the Scottish Government to use its Biomass strategy to ensure that proper incentives and support are provided to enable the establishment of more co-digestion facilities throughout Scotland,&quot;.</p>
