Holiday</em> that pointed out that Thomas Cook had one of the lowest customer approval ratings of any holiday company, with complaints including poor-quality hotel rooms and unhelpful staff as well as accusations that the tour operator&rsquo;s brochures exaggerated standards on offer; believes that, if the views of the 139 passengers who had the misfortune to be booked on flight TCX841L on 26 December 2009 had been included, the report would have been even more critical of Thomas Cook; understands that this flight from Las Palmas to Glasgow was cancelled without notice, that passengers were given no information for hours on end, that the flight eventually left more than 13 hours late and that passengers were told that booking conditions meant that Thomas Cook was obliged to take them only to the United Kingdom not to Glasgow and that if they did not board the flight provided to take them to East Midlands Airport they could find their own way home; recognises that the exhausted passengers included people who were ill, very young, very elderly and heavily pregnant who were apparently told untruths throughout their journey and arrived in Glasgow 20 hours late after having been bussed from East Midlands Airport to Glasgow Airport, and considers that treating customers in such a cavalier take-it-or-leave-it fashion without so much as an apology will do as much to damage the reputation of Thomas Cook as any report and that Thomas Cook needs to spend less on advertising and more on looking after its customers if it is to retain its reputation as a trustworthy company.</p>
