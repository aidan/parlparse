<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7969 Patricia Ferguson: North Glasgow Housing Association Investing in People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the award to North Glasgow Housing Association of Silver level accreditation by Investors in People; acknowledges the praise given to the motivation and commitment of staff, the openness to new approaches and the commitment to helping tenants get the best from living in the area; congratulates the management committee, leadership team and staff of the association, and wishes them well as they strive for Gold accreditation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7968 Rhona Brankin on behalf of the Public Petitions Committee: The Work of the Public Petitions Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continued evolution of its public petitions process; applauds the work of petitioners who have engaged with their parliament through this process by highlighting issues of concern and importance that led to examination by the Public Petitions Committee and key policy makers; believes the process to be a positive demonstration of the Parliament&rsquo;s founding principles, and supports the work of the committee and petitioners in bringing further improvements to the policies that affect the day-to-day lives of the people of Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Farquhar Munro<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7967 David Whitton: Marie Curie Cancer Care in Scotland, Great Daffodil Appeal, March 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes Marie Curie Cancer Care success with the 2011 Great Daffodil Appeal, which raises valuable funds that contribute to ongoing palliative care and support, free of charge, for people at the end of their lives, regardless of their illness; recognises that in 2009-10 Marie Curie Cancer Care provided free care to around 4,622 patients and their families in Scotland, and believes that terminally ill people should be able to live and die where they choose wherever possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7966 Lewis Macdonald: Concerns Regarding Scottish Tourism Revenues</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concerns raised by tourism and transport operators about the impact of recent and planned rises in air passenger duty (APD); notes the recent report commissioned by Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, which suggests that the increase in APD in November 2010 could cost Scotland&rsquo;s airports more than one million passengers over the next three years and cost the wider Scottish economy up to &pound;77 million in spending by tourists; regrets the decision by the current Scottish administration to discontinue and not replace what was considered the highly successful air route development fund, and believes that the time has come to boost international trade and tourist visits by a new initiative to support the development of new, direct air services to Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7965 Lewis Macdonald: Congratulations to Tillydrone Vision</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Tillydrone Vision on the successful delivery of a tractor to the community of Bezallel in Uganda and on the &pound;10,000 that was raised to build a compound wall to keep the children safe; acknowledges the efforts of the Tillydrone community in raising money for the people of Bezallel, which it believes to be a fantastic example of international solidarity between disadvantaged communities, and wishes Tillydrone Vision every success in its efforts.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7961 Sandra White: University Cuts Don&rsquo;t Add Up</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns cost-cutting proposals by management at the University of Glasgow, which will reportedly see the university&rsquo;s nursing courses and what is considered its highly valued modern languages department decimated alongside adult learning courses, which, it believes, have brought immeasurable benefit to many adult learners; understands that, contrary to the view being put forward by the university&rsquo;s principal, Anton Muscatelli, the University of Glasgow received an increase in public funding this year; further considers that claims that the institution could run out of money by 2013 are severely undermined by the fact that the &pound;3 million savings proposed by these cuts represent less than 1% of the university&rsquo;s income; believes that Glasgow&rsquo;s world-renowned reputation for academic excellence will be threatened by these proposals, and hopes that the university&rsquo;s principal and management will, in the face of such widespread opposition, abandon what it considers these ill-thought-out and discredited proposals.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7958 Dr Richard Simpson: Tobacco and Alcohol in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the damaging impact to Scotland&rsquo;s public health caused by tobacco and alcohol in society; is aware of the devastating health and social impact that both substances can cause; recognises the huge cost to Scotland in dealing with both tobacco and alcohol; believes that both sectors can learn from each other in tackling the health problems that these substances cause; further believes that the first joint conference on the issue organised by ASH Scotland, Alcohol Focus Scotland and Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems will help explore the issues surrounding Scotland&rsquo;s use of tobacco and alcohol, and urges the Scottish Government to consider any recommendations emanating from the conference that seek to reduce the harmful impact of tobacco and alcohol in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7955 Marilyn Livingstone: Coordination Centre at Fife Ness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal to close the coordination centre at Fife Ness as part of a national programme to reduce the number of centres in the UK from eighteen to 8; believes that the closure of what it sees as a well established locally-based coastguard coordination centre could have a negative impact on the close working relationships that it believes have developed over many years between emergency responders in Fife and the Fife Ness coastguard staff; understands that the proposals put at risk twenty jobs at the Forth Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre; believes that the traffic on the Firth of Forth is likely to increase as offshore renewable energy installations are built off the Fife coast and begin operation; considers the cost-cutting proposals, which would leave only one 24-hour manned station remaining in Scotland, to be unacceptable, and believes that closing the coordination centre at Fife Ness, without holding a consultation with the local community, will have significant consequences for the safety of Scotland&rsquo;s seas.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7954 Anne McLaughlin: Good News for Glasgow Cathcart</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes news that Scottish entrepreneur Jim McColl will fund a vocational education school in Cathcart, Glasgow; notes that the school will work with local schools in Cathcart to provide vocational training for 14 to 16-year-olds; welcomes the fact that there is a promise of a future job after training; commends Jim McColl for demonstrating confidence in the young people of Cathcart and the local economy, and believes that this will be a welcome boost to the community and Glasgow as a whole.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7943 Patrick Harvie: Proposed University of Glasgow Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern regarding cost-cutting proposals at the University of Glasgow in a number of areas including a reduction in the number of modern languages available for study to two or at most three, which it understands would mean the cessation of the teaching of Russian, Polish, Czech, Portuguese, German and potentially Italian; considers that potentially affected staff and students were given alarmingly short notice of these proposals; also considers that the proposals do not take account of the importance of language learning in higher education for the health of Britain&rsquo;s economy and future business prosperity that has been highlighted by a number of recent reports; believes that many universities feel forced to make cuts because of the political choices made by the Scottish and UK governments to cut higher education funding, and calls on the Scottish Government to protect higher education against this agenda of cuts and to work with the Principal of the University of Glasgow to prevent the destruction of entire courses in modern languages, nursing, anthropology, social work and adult education and to begin a new, meaningful consultation process with staff and students to seek mutually acceptable alternatives that would safeguard university education for the long term.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7941 Jackie Baillie: University of Glasgow School of Nursing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the University of Glasgow&rsquo;s proposal to scrap its nursing course as part of a move to save &pound;20 million over the next three years; considers that the nursing department at the University of Glasgow is outstanding and notes that the course has been rated in the top 10 of <em>The Times</em> Good University Guide for the last three years; further notes that NHS boards across Scotland are cutting 1,500 nursing and midwifery posts and considers that the loss of frontline posts and skills will inevitably have a detrimental impact on patient care; therefore urges the University of Glasgow to reconsider its decision, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to intervene urgently to prevent cuts to frontline NHS services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7940 Shirley-Anne Somerville: MECOPP</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh&rsquo;s Minority Ethnic Carers of Older People Project (MECOPP) on being awarded first prize at the 2011 European Local Authorities Competition on Good Practice on the Support for Migrant Elders&rsquo; Initiatives in Brussels, an accolade awarded to those organisations demonstrating &quot;outstanding municipal initiatives for the improvement of the quality of life of migrant elders&quot;; considers that MECOPP has done valuable work in providing a variety of services to black and minority ethnic carers and communities in the Edinburgh and Lothian&rsquo;s region, including the provision of multilingual language support, mediation between clients and third parties and support in education and employment opportunities; considers MECOPP to be an exemplar in this field of support, and wishes it continued success in the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7935.1 Jackson Carlaw: Scottish Ferry Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7935) in the name of Brian Adam, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the first consideration when examining the future of ferry services in Scotland must be the need to protect the interests of ferry users as opposed to defending existing structures; is concerned that there has been a huge increase in subsidy to Scotland&rsquo;s state-run ferry operations in recent years, as noted by SNP councillor Roy Pedersen who stated in <em>State Aids and Scottish Ferries: Submission to the European Commission </em>that &quot;In contrast with other state subsidised ferry systems worldwide, Scotland does not compare favourably. Subsidy levels as a proportion [of] operating costs have risen in the case of CalMac from 18% of operating costs in 1991 to 45% in 2007, yet fares and charges remained relatively high and traffic growth is sluggish. For Northlink, the comparable percentages are 22% in 1991 to an astonishing 62% in 2007&quot;; notes the further comments of Councillor Pedersen expressed in evidence to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee&rsquo;s inquiry, Ferry Services in Scotland, that &quot;There is a lot of scope for the private sector to contribute to ferry services in Scotland. The current tendering system seems almost designed to inhibit the private sector in contributing ... Something more flexible is required for the future&quot;; also notes the view expressed in the cross-party Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee&rsquo;s <em>4th Report, 2008 (Session 3): Ferry Services in Scotland</em> that &quot;little new thinking or real innovation has taken place in respect of delivering ferry services in Scotland. In most cases, established practice has prevailed &hellip; there has been a lack of clear strategic policy direction and leadership&quot;; notes the examples of Western Ferries and Pentland Ferries that, it considers, provide popular and high-quality ferry services without any public subsidy despite having to compete with subsidised services, and therefore calls for the immediate publication of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Scottish Ferries Review coupled with a robust debate about the future funding and structure of ferry services.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7706# Helen Eadie: Celebrating the Coalfields Regeneration Trust&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament remembers that coal mines across the United Kingdom were closed during the 1980s and 1990s and considers that the effects were devastating not only to workers and their families but to their wider communities especially in Scotland in towns and villages such as Lochgelly, Cardenden, Kinglassie and Kelty where the scars run deep and have left an enduring regeneration challenge; celebrates the fact that in 1999 the Coalfields Regeneration Trust was formed as an independent charity operating on a UK-wide basis, funded in Scotland by the Scottish Executive, and is the only organisation dedicated solely to the social and economic regeneration of coalfield communities; further commemorates the efforts of miners across the centuries in helping to build Scotland into what it is today and, in recognition of their efforts, pledges to continue to do all that it can to say thank you to folk in those coal-mining communities whose harshness of life over the years entitles them to fulsome support, and would welcome a demonstration of gratitude on behalf of all of the people of Scotland by ensuring full financial support is given to the Coalfields Regeneration Trust in Scotland. </p>
