to motion (S1M-3469) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from &quot;consultation&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;urgent need, in relation to tourism and the economy in 
Scotland, to increase the limited number of direct international connections and 
to expand the number of routes operated by low-cost carriers; further notes that 
Inverness Airport is operated by Highlands and Islands Airport Limited, which 
is wholly owned by Scottish Ministers; is concerned at studies indicating that 
Inverness Airport has the highest landing charges in Europe, and therefore calls 
on the Scottish Executive to set up a route development fund to promote direct 
international connections from Scotland and to take immediate action to reduce 
the landing charges imposed at Inverness Airport.&quot; </P></DIR></DIR><P><em>followed
