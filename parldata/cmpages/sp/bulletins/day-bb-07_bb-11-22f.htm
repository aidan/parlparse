<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-903</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>CSV Scotland&rsquo;s Dare to Care Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of CSV Scotland&rsquo;s Dare to Care campaign which asks people to make time to end child poverty; backs its aims of showing how volunteering can make a difference in the fight to end child poverty; encourages organisations to register for this scheme and take advantage of the &pound;50 grant available; urges every MSP to identify a local group and support it to take part in the campaign; recognises not only the valuable contribution that volunteering makes to good causes but also to the personal development of volunteers; notes with deep regret that one in four children still live in poverty, and looks forward to achieving the historic 2020 target to end child poverty in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-902</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Additional Investment in Central Heating Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, Nicola Sturgeon, of an additional &pound;7 million in funding for the government&rsquo;s central heating programme to ensure central heating and hot water for all those pensioners most in need this winter; welcomes the corresponding increase in capacity to avoid lengthening waiting times for those already scheduled for upgrades or installations, and congratulates the Scottish Government on its effective and thorough response to concerns over the provision of central heating for pensioners this winter.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-899</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Say No to Racism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends and supports the annual Scottish Trades Union Congress St Andrew&rsquo;s Day Anti-Racism March and Rally taking place in Glasgow on Saturday 24 November 2007; welcomes the all-party support for the march and rally, sponsored by the Glasgow Anti Racist Alliance; congratulates those who stand together against racism and fascism, and notes the theme of this year&rsquo;s march which commemorates the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-897</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Darling Must Resign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the privacy and security of thousands of Scottish families as a result of HM Treasury&rsquo;s sheer incompetence in losing the child benefit details of 7 million families including parents&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s names, addresses, dates of birth, child benefit and national insurance numbers and in some cases, bank or building society details; refuses to accept the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s apology for the extremely serious failure but insistence that people are not at risk from identity fraud; believes that such empty promises are an insult to families across the country who at this time are very worried that they may be at risk, especially in light of comments by the technology analysts, Gartner, who warn that, if the information is in the hands of criminals, they could try to take over peoples&rsquo; bank accounts to remove the money in them and information from Douglas Thomson of Glasgow who may have already suffered such a theft after having &pound;2,800 removed from his bank account by someone who pretended to be his wife, but convinced his bank through the use of child benefit information to empty their account; believes that, as the person ultimately responsible, the Chancellor, Alistair Darling MP, should resign and that the millions of families suffering undue worry and the loss of their confidential information over this issue should be compensated by the UK Government.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-896</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>The Folly of a Database State</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the loss by HM Revenue and Customs of the personal details of approximately 25 million UK citizens, more than 40% of the population; notes that the UK Cabinet wishes to further expand the database state by establishing a national identity register, and is of the opinion that not only would such a development infringe civil liberties and have little or no beneficial effect with respect to crime or terrorism but would, as the loss of 25 million personal details demonstrates, amount to an act of arrant folly and possibly increase the risks to which UK citizens are exposed.</p>
