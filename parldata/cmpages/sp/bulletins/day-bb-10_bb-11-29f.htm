<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  
  
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  
  
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  
  
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  
  
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7499 Maureen Watt: People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery Welcomes the Woodland Trust Scotland as New Charity Partner</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement that the Woodland Trust Scotland has been named the People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery&rsquo;s new charity partner; considers that the Woodland Trust Scotland can now count itself among a distinguished repertoire of charity partners that are supported by the lottery in Scotland, including CHILDREN 1ST, Missing People in Scotland, Maggie&rsquo;s Cancer Caring Centres, WWF Scotland, the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the People&rsquo;s Postcode Trust; considers that the unrestricted nature of the People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery funding means that the charity partners, such as the Woodland Trust Scotland, can target support where they feel that it is needed the most; understands that this commitment of support from the lottery and its players will be a huge boost to the Woodland Trust Scotland in helping to create new native woodland and maintaining the 80 woods, covering an area of 8,500 hectares of Scottish countryside, under its purview, and fully supports this partnership and continued investment in good causes by the People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7498 Richard Lochhead: Annual Fisheries Negotiations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes efforts to secure a fair outcome in the forthcoming EU fisheries negotiations; believes that any deal must respect the need to harvest fish stocks sustainably in the interests of Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen and coastal communities and recognise Scotland&rsquo;s fishing industry&rsquo;s contribution to fisheries conservation, and urges the European Commission to support efforts to reduce wasteful discards.</p>
<p>Supported by: Roseanna Cunningham<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7497 Jamie McGrigor: Congratulations to RockNess Music Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the RockNess music festival on being named Line-up of the Year 2010 at the UK Festival Awards; notes that this award was voted for by members of the public; believes that RockNess is now a firm favourite on the UK music festival scene and that it, along with the other music festivals such as Tartan Heart, are of immense value to the economy of the Highlands and Islands, attracting many thousands of additional visitors to the area; welcomes the line-up for RockNess 2011, which is to include Kasabian, the Chemical Brothers and Paolo Nutini, and wishes the organisers of RockNess and the other music festivals in the Highlands and Islands every success for 2011.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7487 Dr Richard Simpson: Dropping of Antidepressant Prescribing Target</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets what it considers the precipitate dropping of the target to reduce antidepressant prescribing by 10% without debate or discussion by the Parliament and considers that, while welcoming the new target to improve access to the so-called talking therapies, the Scottish Government has failed to match the NHS in England by training an equivalent to its 3,000 new therapists, a move that it believes could have contributed to at least stabilising if not reducing prescribing.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7475 Ian McKee: BAA Domestic Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at BAA&rsquo;s proposals to increase domestic departure charges at London Heathrow from April 2011, which would see the charge rise from &pound;13.43 to &pound;20.25, an increase of over 50%; notes that the move would bring the charges in line with those for international passengers; considers that this is completely unjustifiable given that domestic passengers do not use the same facilities asinternational passengers, such as customs and immigration channels; believes that the charges would discriminate against Scottish travellers, including local businesses and leisure travellers, and would damage Scotland&rsquo;s economy, which in its view depends on air connectivity to and from Heathrow; further believes that, in the absence of a high speed rail network connecting London to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland must rely on good value domestic air links, and calls on BAA to reconsider its proposal.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7358# Jamie Hepburn: Nine Years of Conflict in Afghanistan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 7 October 2010 marked the ninth anniversary of the start of Operation Enduring Freedom by the United States&rsquo; military in Afghanistan and that 20 December 2010 will mark the ninth anniversary of the establishment of the International Security Assistance Force by the United Nations; further notes that this is longer than the duration of World War I and of World War II, and nearly as long as both these wars combined; regrets the loss of life caused by the conflict, including 341 military personnel from the United Kingdom, 2,174 from coalition forces in total and thousands of civilian causalities; considers that there is widespread concern among residents in Central Scotland and across the country at the ongoing loss of life, both military and civilian, in Afghanistan, and believes that greater progress is required to be made on a timely exit strategy.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7227# Elaine Smith: There Is a Better Way</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the STUC on the launch of its There is a Better Way campaign; believes that deep, savage and immediate cuts are neither unavoidable nor inevitable and that they would actually threaten economic recovery across Scotland and in areas such as Coatbridge and Chryston; further believes that a sensible and sustainable response to the current economic crisis is to promote growth and ensure fairness through creating jobs and protecting services, through fair taxation and a living wage, and would welcome widespread support for the STUC campaign.</p>
