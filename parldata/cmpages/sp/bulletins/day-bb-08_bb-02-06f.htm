<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section.</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1316</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Congratulating Scottish Science</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of the recently published <em>Metrics for the Scottish Research Base</em> report commissioned by the Scottish Government; notes that outcomes, in terms of research recognition, citations, training and research quality, are excellent at 2% of world highly-cited papers, 1% of world citations and 0.8% of publications; notes that Scottish scientists perform well in a variety of fields and are first in the world in terms of impact, in health and related sciences, and first in the world in terms of citations per GDP; further notes that, for the Scottish research base as a whole, the average impact has increased progressively over the last 10 years, placing Scotland second in the world behind only Switzerland, and congratulates Scottish-based scientists for the quality of their research.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1315</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> <strong>Commercial Forestry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, mindful of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s purpose to achieve sustainable economic growth, acknowledges the contribution that forests and woodlands make through timber, tourism and direct and indirect employment, and recognises the need to support the continued development and expansion of the commercial Scottish forestry sector and the competitive and developing industries which it underpins.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1312</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Suspension of Standing Orders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, for the purpose of allowing up to 20 minutes to debate motion S3M-1306 on Thursday 21 February 2008, the second and third sentences of Rule 10.6.5 of Standing Orders be suspended.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1311</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Launch of the Automotrice Grande Vitesse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the launch of the Automotrice Grande Vitesse, a new generation high-speed train, which will be used on the rapidly developing European high-speed rail network; believes that such progress on mainland Europe leaves the UK rail network at risk of falling even further behind technological developments and consequently facing greater difficulty in achieving integration; welcomes new initiatives by the Scottish Government to improve Scotland&rsquo;s rail infrastructure, and further believes that the people of Scotland will only achieve the 21st-century high speed rail network that they need and deserve once the Parliament has all the powers necessary to bring this about.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1310#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Task Force</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with serious concern the report by the Centre of Social Justice, published on 5 February 2008, showing that Glasgow has 170 teenage gangs, the same as London, with a population one-sixth of the size; acknowledges the Federation of Small Businesses Scotland&rsquo;s <em>FSB Index of Success 2007</em> which showed that Glasgow had the poorest rating for education, health, employment and inequality of all the 32 local authority areas in Scotland and the policy recommendations of the report highlighting the need for cross-party support at national and local level in order to take forward crucial policies and address the serious problems facing Glasgow, and hopes that this new report will serve as a catalyst for all parties to support the establishment of a special task force for Glasgow to tackle such inequality.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1309</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Food Without Fear Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of the proper handling by chefs and caterers of allergens in loose foods in hospitals, schools and eating establishments; notes the recent publication of guidance by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to increase the understanding of chefs and caterers and to protect consumers with a food intolerance; recognises that people with coeliac disease have an autoimmune disease and that the only treatment is a lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet; notes that for people with coeliac disease eating in hospital can be restrictive and potentially unsafe if proper guidelines are not followed; urges hospitals to improve the availability of gluten-free choices and chefs and caterers in all eating establishments to do the same; calls for the impact of the new FSA guidance on the handling of allergens in loose foods to be monitored to achieve greater understanding, awareness and gluten-free choices on menus, and supports Coeliac UK in its Food Without Fear campaign to raise chefs&rsquo; and caterers&rsquo; awareness and understanding of coeliac disease to ensure that eating out through pleasure or need for those who suffer from this condition is made less restrictive.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1304</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>God Bless the SNP Government</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the statement by Glasgow City Council leader, Steven Purcell, confirming the Labour administration&rsquo;s intention to freeze its council tax levels for a third year; recognises that this is in stark contrast to the 20%, 22% and 12% rises in its first three years as a unitary authority; welcomes the comments of one councillor who stated &quot;The opposition Scottish Government is giving us money to do what we were planning to do anyway.

<p><strong>S3M-1266</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Responsible Procurement Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the launch of its responsible procurement strategy; notes that, rather than just being a collection of worthy policies, this is a systematic approach to responsible procurement which aims to transform culture across the Parliament; further commends the publication of the strategy to meet the Parliament&rsquo;s needs without jeopardising the ability of others to meet their needs in the future; acknowledges that this is a contribution to the high standard of environmental management already adopted in the Parliament, which was the first public body to adopt ecological footprint as a corporate key performance indicator, and notes that, by seeking the highest standards in its operations, we can demonstrate that we should all aspire to be responsible global citizens.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1266.1</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Responsible Procurement Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1266) in the name of Joe FitzPatrick, after &quot;key performance indicator&quot; insert &quot;; welcomes the&nbsp;commitment to incorporate animal welfare as an area for policy development, which is another example of the Scottish&nbsp;Parliament taking a lead on an issue of public concern&quot;.</p>
