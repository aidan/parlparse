            Abuse in Scotland by raising awareness of the issue and increasing 
            the protection of women and children experiencing domestic abuse and 
            the services available to them and welcomes the work of the National

                women reported a domestic abuse incident to the police in the

                recording of a crime or offence and only 66% of those recorded 
                were referred to the procurator fiscal; is appalled at recent 
                research which shows that Scotland has a prosecution rate of 10% 
                and a conviction rate of 6% following rape allegations, the second 
                poorest conviction rate in Europe; welcomes the &quot;prevention, 
                protection, provision&quot; theme of the National Strategy to 
                Address Domestic Abuse in Scotland and work done to date, but 
                believes that the Scottish Executive must consider what action 
                could reasonably be taken to improve dramatically prosecution
