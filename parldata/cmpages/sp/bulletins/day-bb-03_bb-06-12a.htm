          <p align="CENTER"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
                <p>9:30 am&#9;Debate on Europe&#151;</p>
                <p><strong>S2M-124</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> 
                  <strong>Europe</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the 
                  European Union as a confederation that collectively exercises 
                  certain sovereign rights pooled by states but in which each 
                  state retains its own sovereignty in respect of constitutional, 
                  fiscal and other matters of national importance; believes that 
                  decisions about pooled and retained sovereignty should always 
                  be taken in Scotland&#146;s national interest; therefore welcomes 
                  the development of a European constitution but opposes the conferral 
                  of exclusive European Union competence over the conservation 
                  of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy; 
                  considers that the terms of the final draft constitution should 
                  be subject to the approval of the Scottish people in a referendum 
                  prior to ratification; regrets that the decision by Her Majesty&#146;s 
                  Government to delay entry to the single currency does not take 
                  account of Scotland&#146;s economic interests, and believes 
                  that Scotland&#146;s interests would best be represented in 
                  the European Union as an independent member state</p>
				  
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-124.4</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Europe</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-124) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave 
            out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the 
            many benefits that the European Union (EU) has delivered for Europe 
            and for Scotland; continues to believe that the EU should seek to 
            become more effective, efficient, democratic, transparent, accountable 
            and easier to understand; notes the work of the Convention on the 
            Future of Europe towards these objectives; further welcomes the submission 
            to the convention of the proposals on Europe and the regions drawn 
            up by the Scottish Executive in conjunction with Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government and the Welsh Assembly Government; further notes with approval 
            the references in the draft Constitutional Treaty under consideration 
            in the convention to the role of the regions, and to mechanisms for 
            consulting them; welcomes the intention of Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to involve the devolved administrations in the operation of the subsidiarity 
            mechanism proposed by the convention, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to continue to work with other sub-member state administrations and 
            Her Majesty&#146;s Government to ensure that Scottish interests are 
            fully taken into account during the forthcoming Inter-Governmental 
            Conference.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-124.2</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: Europe</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-124) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave 
            out from &quot;confederation&quot; to end and insert "partnership 
            of nation states working together for the common interest; expresses 
            concern at the clearly federalist objectives of the current proposals 
            of the Convention on the Future of Europe; pledges to analyse the 
            detail of these proposals as they affect devolved responsibilities 
            and report back our objections to Her Majesty's Government along with 
            our view that, given the conclusions drawn up by HM Treasury over 
            the last six years on the United Kingdom entering the European single 
            currency, there is no basis for the United Kingdom surrendering the 
            pound for the euro and that further uncertainty on monetary union 
            will be bad for Scottish interests, and urges Her Majesty's Government 
            to hold an early referendum on both the Convention proposals and European 
            monetary union."</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-124.3</strong> <strong>Frances Curran: Europe</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-124) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave 
            out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes in 
            a socially just, democratic and accountable Europe for citizens and 
            not big business; further believes that the structure of the current 
            European Union undermines democracy within Scotland and that any further 
            attempt to centralise political power in Brussels, or financial decisions 
            at the European Central Bank in Stuttgart, would not be in the interest 
            of ordinary Scots; is concerned that the economic agenda of European 
            monetary union has the intention of furthering the aims of capitalist 
            globalisation and the interests of trans-global corporations, resulting 
            in lower wages, cuts in public services and a wholesale onslaught 
            against workers&#146; pensions; demands the right of the Scottish 
            people to make their views known through a referendum; opposes entry 
            to the euro, and calls on the Scottish Executive to offer to host 
            the 2004 annual anti-globalisation event, the European Social Forum, 
            involving up to 100,000 people, that has already taken place in Florence 
            and will meet in Paris in November 2003.&quot;</p>

            for a reliable, safe, efficient and sustainable transport system to

            the environmental, health and educational needs of people of Scotland</p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-34</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of Animal Welfare Centres</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned 
            about the possible closure of at least seven of the 13 animal welfare 
            centres across Scotland owing to financial difficulties being experienced 
            by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA); 
            believes that this would be detrimental to animal welfare; notes with 
            relief that the SSPCA board of management has postponed making a final 
            decision on the closures of the centres for a further six months, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should hold urgent discussions 
            with the SSPCA to try to find a way of keeping the animal welfare 
            centres open. </p>
