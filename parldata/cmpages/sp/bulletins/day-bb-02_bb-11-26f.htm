Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3637</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Jackie Baillie: Argyll and Clyde NHS Acute Hospitals Trust</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the apparent difficulty of Argyll and Clyde NHS Acute Hospitals 
Trust in managing to provide a full range of services to meet the needs of the 
local population; further notes the resignation of key health service personnel 
over the last few months and the failure of management to recruit, which has led 
to instability and uncertainty over the future of service provision in the area, 
particularly at the Vale of Leven District General Hospital; recognises and applauds 
the commitment of front-line staff, doctors, nurses, auxiliaries and others, in 
maintaining excellent standards of health care for people in the area; notes the 
welcome intervention of the Minister for Health and Community Care in sending 
in a support team to consider and act on any management failures, and calls upon 
the Scottish Executive and Argyll and Clyde NHS Board to act quickly on the recommendations 
made by the support team to restore professional and public confidence in the 
service.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3636</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Solidarity with 
Firefighters</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Labour MSP Cathy 
Peattie for her solidarity with the firefighters and her remarks reported in the 
<em>Daily Record</em> on 23 November 2002 that she is ashamed of John Prescott and 
calls on all MSPs to back the firefighters in their week of action to secure their 
just wage claim.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3635</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Firefighters' 
Strike</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament condemns remarks attributed to a Scottish 
Executive minister that were reported in <em>Scotland on Sunday</em> on 24 November 
2002 that &quot;these people aren&#146;t socialists, they&#146;re protectionists, 
they&#146;re fascists&quot; and demands that, if these remarks were made, the 
minister concerned apologises to the firefighters and is removed from office or 
that, if they were not made, the Scottish Executive issues an immediate statement 
condemning <em>Scotland on Sunday</em> for misrepresentation.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3634#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Ms Margo MacDonald: European Commission Directive on Food Supplements</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes that millions of people use food supplements and herbal remedies 
in the UK each year; regrets that the European Commission has published a directive 
on food supplements that will firstly reduce the numbers of supplements offered 
and secondly reduce the potency of those which remain, and, whilst noting the 
UK Government&#146;s assurances that such supplements will be treated as favourably 
as possible under UK law, considers that the Scottish Executive should do everything 
within its power to protect the right of consumers to continue to access the full 
range of supplements currently available.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3633</STRONG> <STRONG>Tricia 
Marwick: Scottish Executive's Position on the Fire Brigades Union</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">deplores comments in respect of members of 
the Fire Brigades Union, attributed to a Scottish Minister in <em>Scotland on Sunday 
</em>on 24 November 2002, that &quot;&#133;these people aren&#146;t socialists, 
they&#146;re protectionists, they&#146;re fascists&#133;&quot; and, if the comments 
do not represent the view of the Scottish Executive, calls for an apology to be 
made to firefighters.</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3629 Bioinformatics and Opportunities
