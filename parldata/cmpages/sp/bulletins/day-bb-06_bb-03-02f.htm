<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;
  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4049</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Removal of Tolls from the Erskine Bridge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the historic announcement by the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications that tolls will be removed from the Erskine Bridge as of 31 March 2006; congratulates all those involved in the campaign to scrap the tolls, in particular local councils, chambers of commerce and local people; considers that this decision is right for the environment, easing congestion on the Kingston Bridge and the Clyde Tunnel, and right for the local economy, with communities on both sides of the Clyde benefiting from this action, and encourages the Scottish Executive to lock in the environmental gains and consider how to maximise the economic impact of the removal of tolls as a first step in regenerating the entirety of the Clyde corridor, including Dumbarton and the Vale of Leven.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4048</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Neptune Warrior Military Exercises</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and the armed forces of several UK allies are taking part in the major war-games exercise, Neptune Warrior 061, around the coast of Scotland from 25 February to 11 March 2006; further notes that the current exercise is one of a new series called Neptune Warrior of which there are expected to be up to three every year; recognises that the Ministry of Defence has issued notice that there will be naval guns firing at the land next to Cape Wrath as well as aircraft bombing; notes with concern that this firing is within the recently designated UNESCO North West Highlands Geopark, a status awarded because of the area&rsquo;s special diverse geology and landscapes and one of only 32 geoparks world-wide; believes that US shelling exercises were moved from Puerto Rico to Scotland because of local opposition following the use of depleted uranium shells at the Vieques range in Puerto Rico; is concerned at the further intention to test the new Sonar-2087 submarine detection system, acknowledged by the UK Government to be harmful to dolphins and whales; is also concerned by reports that hundreds of whales, dolphins and porpoises worldwide have beached themselves and died in incidents where it was likely they had been disorientated by naval sonar, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to the UK Government to have the shelling of the Scottish coastline and the testing of Sonar-2087 halted because of impact on Scottish landscape, wildlife and local economies.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4047</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Stop Climate Chaos</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of a pledge campaign by the organisation, Stop Climate Chaos, the coalition of environment, development and faith organisations which has been formed to tackle climate change; acknowledges the strength of concern about climate change which exists within many organisations&nbsp;in Scottish civic society; believes that effective international action to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases across all sectors is urgently required; supports the pledge campaign objective of persuading people to make changes in their lifestyle that will save energy and reduce their emissions of climate change gases; urges all politicians to play their part, and calls on the Scottish Executive to act without delay to ensure that all&nbsp;of its policies are climate-proofed.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4046</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Senior Citizens and Tolls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with approval that the tolls have been removed from the Erskine and Skye bridges, but deplores the fact that a postcode lottery now applies to the Forth and Tay road bridges; further appreciates the free bus travel for all senior citizens in Scotland, and asks the Scottish Executive to give consideration to giving exemption from paying tolls to all car-driving senior citizens to coincide with the implementation of the concessionary travel scheme.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4045</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Southern Reporter 150th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>Southern Reporter, </em>based in Selkirk, serving the central and western Borders and for many years under the stewardship of the Smail family, on its 150th anniversary; notes its lead in recent years on such issues as education overspend, Miss X, saving the regiments, particularly the King&rsquo;s Own Scottish Borderers, and of course, under the headline &quot;The Final Betrayal&quot;, exposing the closure of factories in Selkirk by US asset-strippers, Viasystems, who, having helped themselves to &pound;24 million of public funds, after one year threw 1,200 Borderers on the scrap heap, and wishes the publication continued success, along with other Borders&rsquo; newspapers, in reflecting and campaigning on issues at the core of Borders life.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4044</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>The Draft Scotland Act 1998 (Transfer of Functions to Scottish Ministers) (No.2) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Enterprise and Culture Committee recommends that the draft Scotland Act 1998 (Transfer of Functions to Scottish Ministers) (No.2) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4043</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>National Business Plan Competition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the teams of &quot;Berry Scrumptious&quot; from Robert Gordon University, &quot;Paper Filament&quot; from Glasgow School of Art and the University of Glasgow and &quot;Incidental Kairos&quot; from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama on their success as winners of the National Business Plan Competition which took place on Wednesday 1 March 2006&nbsp;in Dundee; salutes their success against high-quality applicants from 14 other universities across Scotland; wishes them well as they begin to negotiate investment to grow their companies, and recognises the role played by the organisers, the Scottish Institute for Enterprise, in developing enterprise and business skills in Scottish higher education institutions.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4042.1</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Architecture</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4042) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, leave out from &quot;to date&quot; to end and insert &quot;in this area by independent and voluntary organisations, including the Lighthouse and An Lanntair; notes the importance of the efficient use of existing building stock, and believes that a strong economy and a fair planning system are integral to a successful built environment.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4042.2</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Architecture</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4042) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, leave out from &quot;its vital role&quot; to end and insert &quot;that our buildings have a critical role to play in maintaining and enhancing the quality of Scotland&rsquo;s urban and rural communities; notes the progress made to date on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policy on architecture, and calls on the Executive to ensure that future national architectural policy places greater emphasis on local authorities developing their own local architectural policy.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4039.1</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Shirley McKie</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4039) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &quot;issues&quot; to end and insert &quot;the public is still not satisfied that the truth of the matter is all available; recognises that the McKie family campaign is not satisfied that there was no conspiracy against her; also recognises that the four Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) fingerprint workers are furious that their competence and reputation has been sullied; believes that the Scottish Executive has a duty to address all these concerns, and calls for a public inquiry to get to the truth of this matter and to restore public confidence in the SCRO and the fingerprint service as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p><a name="UniqueIdPlusText" id="UniqueIdPlusText"></a><strong>S2M-04039.2 Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) (Lab): <a name="IntroText" id="IntroText"></a></strong>As an amendment to motion S2M-04039 in the name of Nicola Sturgeon (Shirley McKie), <a name="MotionText" id="MotionText"></a></p>
<p>leave out from first &quot;with&quot; to end and insert &quot;that action needs to be taken to restore public and professional confidence in the Scottish Fingerprint Service; acknowledges that in 2000 the SCRO Fingerprint Bureau was the subject of an independent inspection by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC); notes that following three further inspections HMIC reported that its 25 recommendations had been fully discharged; notes that further reforms are being taken forward; that the Minister for Justice has instructed the interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Police Services Authority to bring forward, by the end of March, a comprehensive action plan drawing on the best available international scientific advice and management expertise; notes that this action plan will be reported to the Parliament; believes that a public inquiry is not appropriate; notes that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to hold the Scottish Executive to account; welcomes the work already commenced by the Justice 1 Committee, and confirms the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to co-operate with any inquiries that the Parliament may decide to take forward in scrutinising these reforms.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4036.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4036) in the name of Rob Gibson, leave out from &quot;and calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;further expresses concern that Scottish Water is failing to deliver an appropriate level of service to its customers; notes the concerns of the building community about Scottish Water&rsquo;s failure to allocate sufficient resources to remove development constraints; further notes the Executive&rsquo;s admission on 9 February 2005 that business customers have been overcharged &pound;44 million a year for water; further notes that the introduction of surface water drainage charges based on the size of the property are to be introduced into the denationalised English water market on 1 April 2006 which will lead to significantly lower charges for small businesses in England than in Scotland, thereby reinforcing the present competitive disadvantage faced by Scots firms; further notes the comments of former Environment Minister, Sam Galbraith, that &quot;We are slowly going broke and the only way to solve this is to reduce the public sector wage bill. Privatise water and, at a stroke, the bill is cut&quot; (<em>The Scotsman</em>, 10 February 2005); believes that as long as Scottish Water remains a bureaucratic, nationalised monopoly it will struggle to adopt the private sector disciplines expected by the Executive and the Water Industry Commission, and therefore calls on the Executive to take its commitment to make economic growth its top priority seriously by creating a genuine market in water and privatising Scottish Water or adopting a &quot;not for dividend&quot; model such as Welsh Water.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-04036.2 Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD): </strong>As an amendment to motion S2M-04036 in the name of Rob Gibson (Scottish Water), leave out from &quot;,despite&quot; to end and insert &quot;Scottish Water&rsquo;s draft business plan of April 2005 stated that achieving Scottish Ministers' objectives for 2006 to 2010 would require a capital investment programme of &pound;3.7 billion and a doubling in customer charges; notes that the Water Industry Commission&rsquo;s determination of charges for 2006 to 2010 allowed Scottish Water a capital investment programme of &pound;2.1 billion and charges rising by less than the rate of inflation to achieve the objectives; notes that Scottish Water accepted the determination but its plan demonstrating how it would deliver the objectives within the limits set by the determination was judged by the Executive, supported by the regulators, not to meet the requirements in a number of material aspects; notes that the Executive has required Scottish Water to produce a new plan which will command the confidence of Ministers and regulators,and considers these actions by the Executive to represent good stewardship of Scottish Water in the public and customer interest.&quot;</p>
