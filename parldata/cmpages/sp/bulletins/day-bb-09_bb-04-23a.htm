<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Scottish Newspaper Industry&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3947</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Scottish Newspaper Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the threat to the Scottish economy from the current crisis facing Scotland&rsquo;s newspaper and media industries; notes that local newspapers are facing particular difficulties in the current economic climate; opposes any moves towards compulsory redundancies such as those imposed by Trinity Mirror at the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail</em>; calls for all newspaper and media organisations considering restructuring, reorganisation or redundancy to engage in meaningful negotiations with the relevant workforce representatives in order to minimise the economic impact of any job cuts, and calls on the Scottish Government to hold urgent talks with Trinity Mirror management in order to prevent compulsory job cuts. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3947.2</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank: Scottish Newspaper Industry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3947) in the name of David Whitton, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;calls for all newspaper and media organisations considering restructuring, reorganisation or redundancy to engage in meaningful negotiations with the relevant workforce representatives in order to minimise the economic impact of any job cuts, and calls on the Scottish Government to hold urgent talks with Trinity Mirror and to work with all media groups to allow new industry models to emerge that will encourage investment not just in local newspapers but in local online services and new local TV companies.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3947.1</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: Scottish Newspaper Industry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3947) in the name of David Whitton, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses concern at moves towards compulsory redundancies such as those imposed by Trinity Mirror at the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail</em>; notes the importance of a viable and diverse national, regional and local newspaper industry to Scotland&rsquo;s culture; recognises the need to retain talent in Scotland&rsquo;s creative media industries, and calls for all newspaper and media organisations considering restructuring, reorganisation or redundancy to engage in meaningful negotiations with the relevant workforce representatives in order to minimise the economic impact of any job cuts and the need for compulsory redundancies.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: West of Scotland Transport Infrastructure&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3938</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>West of Scotland Transport Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the need for investment in transport infrastructure in the west of Scotland, particularly in the Greater Glasgow travel-to-work area, to ensure the continued competitiveness of the area, especially given that Glasgow and surrounding areas linked with traditional manufacturing and heavy industry, which suffered badly in previous recessions, are experiencing disproportionate increases in unemployment compared with the Scottish average, as illustrated by claimant count statistics. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3938.2</strong> <strong>Gavin Brown: West of Scotland Transport Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3938) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &quot;especially&quot; to end and insert &quot;; therefore regrets the previous Labour-led administration&rsquo;s disappointing record on delivering improvements to key road links connecting the west of Scotland, notably the substantial delays and cost overruns in upgrading the M8 and M74; welcomes the fact that the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link project pioneered by the previous Labour-led administration has been cancelled, thereby freeing up investment for the crucial Edinburgh to Glasgow Rail Improvement Programme, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure the clear prioritisation of transport projects both in the west of Scotland and elsewhere.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-3938.3</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: West of Scotland Transport Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3938) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;welcomes the significant opportunity presented by the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games for the creation of legacy transport infrastructure projects in the west of Scotland, including the proposed redevelopment of Dalmarnock station as a key public transport hub for the Games and the area, offering speedy direct rail links to the main Games venues and to Celtic Park from Lanarkshire, the city centre and the west in particular, as well as a high standard of pedestrian and cyclist pathways through the area; supports the work of Clyde Gateway in developing the project, and urges the Scottish Government to give the Dalmarnock station project its full backing.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3948</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 2014 Legacy Plan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming meeting to take place in Glasgow between the Minister for Public Health and Sport, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Andy Burnham, Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy and Glasgow City Council leader Steven Purcell to discuss the release of a substantial sum of National Lottery funding towards supporting a legacy for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow; supports the work of the Scottish Government and its partners, including the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Glasgow City Council, local authorities across Scotland, NHS boards, public bodies and the third sector, in planning for a legacy for the people of Scotland from these Games; agrees that the Interim Games Legacy Plan, published on 18 December 2008, set the right context for that planning with its emphasis on health, physical activity and sport and its coverage of volunteering, education and learning, culture, sustainability, business, skills, tourism and Scotland&rsquo;s international profile; commends the real opportunity that the hosting of the Games offers for regenerating the east end of Glasgow, and further agrees that, following the launch of the full Games Legacy Plan in the summer, the Scottish Parliament can play a part by encouraging individuals, groups, communities and businesses to get involved so that Scotland&rsquo;s legacy from the 2014 Games can be lasting and positive. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3948.1</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety: Glasgow 2014 Legacy Plan</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3948) in the name of Shona Robison, after &quot;Games in Glasgow&quot; insert &quot;welcomes this new spirit of cooperation and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the UK Government to maximise the benefit of sporting events in Scotland and the wider United Kingdom, especially the 2014 Commonwealth Games and 2012 Olympic Games, in terms of encouraging sporting participation and harnessing the talents of Scots; notes Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s own 2014 legacy plan and calls on the Scottish Government to work with other local authorities to produce their own legacy plans to meet shared aspirations on tackling obesity and low levels of participation&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong>&#9;Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#9;Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-3559</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Future of the Sunday Mail and Daily Record</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of Trinity Mirror to merge the editorial content of the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail</em> with the loss of up to 30% of journalistic staff, based primarily in Glasgow and the west of Scotland; recognises that both newspapers are an integral part of Scottish culture and that to diminish their individual identities would be a serious blow to the diversity, vibrancy and quality of the Scottish media; believes that the loss of their separate identities would undoubtedly lead to the erosion of circulation at both titles, leading inevitably to further job losses; considers that Trinity Mirror is highly profitable and that there is no need to undertake such drastic restructuring, and therefore very much hopes that good sense may prevail over the future of two of Scotland&rsquo;s leading titles.</p>
