          <p><strong>*S1M-2628</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Scottish Borders 
            Education Meltdown</strong>-That the Parliament notes with great concern 
            that Scottish Borders Council has announced a further £7 million of 
            cuts may be made by Scottish Borders Council which would result in 
            (a) eliminating continuing education in the Borders leading to the 
            closure of community wings and centres, including the Abbey Row Centre 
            in Kelso which has 44 dependent organisations, such as mother and 
            toddler and pensioner groups, and the loss of 100 or more jobs; (b) 
            the cessation of funding for 15 voluntary organisations including 
            Borders Womens Aid which will lose £50,000 of core funding and Gala 
            Youth Project which will lose £60,000; (c) the threatened closure 
            of the swimming pools at Jedburgh, Selkirk and Eyemouth, and therefore 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to enter into immediate discussions 
            with the Council administration with a view to providing special borrowing 
            in order that these swingeing cuts are reversed.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="2627"></a>*S1M-2627</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: 
            BSc Course in Audiology</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Queen 
            Margaret University College in Edinburgh has expressed an interest 
            in developing a BSc course in Audiology; recognises that at present 
            there is no school of audiology for Scotland; further recognises that 
            there is a serious lack of trained audiologists to implement the use 
            of digital hearing aid technology across Scotland, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should give its support to Queen Margaret University 
            College to develop and implement this course.</p>
