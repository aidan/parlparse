                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6742 Stuart McMillan: Inverclyde School Wins UNICEF Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glenburn School in Inverclyde on becoming the first secondary school in Scotland to be given the Level 2 Rights Respecting Schools Award (RRSA) by UNICEF; considers that the RRSA provides a coherent values framework that enhances school leadership and shapes the ethos of the school; notes that the award comes 10 months after the school became the first in Scotland to be recognised by the Rights Respecting Schools scheme, which aims to help pupils learn about respecting others&rsquo; rights both in school and in the wider community; acknowledges this tremendous achievement, and passes on best wishes to head teacher Eileen McGeer and all the pupils at Glenburn School.</p>
