<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3920#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Avondale Schools and Fairtrade</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary School in Strathaven for becoming the third primary school in Avondale, along with Sandford Primary School and Chapelton Primary School, to achieve fair trade status with recognition and award from the Fairtrade Foundation; notes that Avondale&rsquo;s further four primary schools and Strathaven Academy are also working towards fair trade status, and congratulates the Strathaven Fairtrade Group on the commitment and dedication it has shown both prior to and since Strathaven became the first Fairtrade Town in Scotland.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-3919</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Cross-Party Consensus on Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the cross-party agreement on climate change signed by the Conservative Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Ulster Democratic Unionist Party, Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party at Westminster and welcomes the aim of this Conservative initiative, that an independent body should be established to monitor and enforce year-on-year carbon reductions, with the aim of achieving at least 60% by 2050, ensuring that long-term emissions cuts would be guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3918</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Fire Services in West Lothian</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s announcement of the &pound;8 million funding package for fire and rescue services in Scotland but notes that this funding will not restore cuts agreed at the Lothian and Borders Fire Board Meeting on 27 January 2006, where Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat councillors voted by 15 to 3 not to retain the Craigshill Fire Station in West Lothian as a two-pump wholetime facility, thereby cutting services at night and on the weekend.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill, Christine Grahame</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3917</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Voluntary Sector Provision of Vital High-Quality Essential Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the high-quality essential services provided by the voluntary sector to a wide range of children and families, many of them from vulnerable groups, is not jeopardised by any freeze on vital funding for such voluntary sector organisations.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christine Grahame, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Mary Scanlon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-3916</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Children Designing Play Facilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, while welcoming motion S2M-3890 on the importance of play in the name of Kenneth Macintosh, emphasises the importance of good and imaginative design of children&rsquo;s play facilities, particularly of involving local children in deciding the facilities to be included in their local playground and their design and management, and encourages councils and other groups planning new or renewed playgrounds to co-operate with local young people, the local community and organisations active in this field.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3915</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Newsquest Job Losses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement by the Newsquest group of up to 65 planned job cuts at <em>The Herald, Sunday Herald </em>and <em>Evening Times, </em>around a third of which may be journalists; offers sympathies to affected workers and their families; notes that this follows the announcement last year by Trinity Mirror of extensive job cuts in Scotland, despite a 20% rise in operational profits and a 5.8% increase in revenue; expresses concern that newspapers are increasingly under-resourced and under-staffed; believes that a wide range of vibrant newspapers with a plurality of opinion is vital to democracy, and calls on Newsquest to reconsider the proposed cuts.</p>

It is now plain that the emission of greenhouse gases, associated with industrialisation and economic growth from a world population that has increased six-fold in 200 years, is causing global warming at a rate that is unsustainable&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the review of its Climate Change Programme is further strengthened, given the seriousness of these findings, and that it brings forward a programme that will reduce Scotland&rsquo;s carbon dioxide emissions year-on-year in line with a national target of 60% reductions by 2050.</p>
