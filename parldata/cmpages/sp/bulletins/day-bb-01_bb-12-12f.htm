          <p><strong>*S1M-2547</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Physical Education 
            in Primary Schools</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the 
            HM Inspectorate of Education report on improving standards of physical 
            education in primary schools in Scotland; notes that the report states 
            that schools with very good programmes often used flexible curriculum 
            time to ensure a minimum of two physical education (PE) sessions of 
            around 40 minutes weekly for pupils, provide broad and balanced programmes 
            which include games, sports, gymnastics, dance and swimming and that 
            the programmes in these schools often extend beyond the school day; 
            compares this with provision at independent schools where PE is often 
            given more time, regular input from specialist PE teachers and additional 
            extracurricular opportunities are provided, and believes that the 
            provision of more specialist PE teachers providing education in individual 
            and team sports, dance and games would increase the number of schools 
            achieving HM Inspectorate of Education&#146;s &#145;very good&#146; 
            status and lead to improvements in the health and well-being of Scotland&#146;s 
            children. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2546</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Sea Fisheries</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to seek to negotiate 
            an outcome from the Fisheries Council meeting in December 2001 that 
            reflects the need to preserve stocks for the long term and represents 
            the best achievable deal for the Scottish fishing industry.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2545</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Scottish 
            Prison Service</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the Executive&#146;s 
            failure to bring forward a strategy to address the increasing overcrowding 
            within Scottish prisons and further notes that morale amongst Scottish 
            Prison Service staff is at rock bottom as the result of (a) the deterioration 
            of industrial relations, (b) the continued threat of further privatisation 
            within the Scottish Prison Service, (c) the culture of secrecy within 
            the service and (d) the continued and unacceptable delay in the publication 
            of the Estates Review.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2544 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2543 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary

            agrees that Rule 13.6.4 be suspended for the purpose of Question Time 
            on Thursday 10 January 2002. </p>

          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2541</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: West of Scotland 
            Cancer Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            recent developments at the Beatson Oncology Centre and the inevitable 
            impact on cancer services in the West of Scotland; welcomes the removal 
            of the Beatson Oncology Centre from the management of North Glasgow 
            University Hospitals NHS Trust, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to now set out in detail what action will be taken to prevent further 
            staff resignations, attract suitably qualified consultants to fill 
            new and vacant posts, ensure temporary staff cover to avoid a rationalisation 
            of cancer services such as the cancellation of clinics, and significantly 
            shorten the timescale for the construction of the new Beatson Oncology 
            Centre at Gartnavel Hospital.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2540</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Career Opportunities 
            in the Scottish Maritime Industry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            warmly commends the crew of the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry &quot;Caledonian 
            Isles&quot;, their shorebased colleagues and members of the Glasgow 
            and West of Scotland Maritime Careers Group for their active participation 
            in recent promotional events designed to raise schoolchildren&#146;s 
            awareness of career opportunities in the Scottish maritime industry 
            and believes that such recruitment initiatives will be of considerable 
            importance to the industry and to Scottish school leavers who are 
            keen to engage in satisfying and worthwhile careers both afloat and 
            ashore. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2539#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil: Research into 
            Cancer Levels in the Semiconductor Industry</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes the publication <em>Cancer Among 
            Current and Previous Workers at National Semiconductor (UK) Ltd, Greenock: 
            Results of an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive</em>; 
            further notes that the study gives cause for concern which can only 
            be addressed through further research across the semiconductor industry; 
            believes that steps should be taken to ensure that GPs and other health 
            professionals are well briefed and prepared for any enquiries from 
            concerned current or former members of the workforce, and further 
            believes that Ministers and officials of the Scottish Executive should 
            work in partnership with all those concerned to ensure that issues 
            arising from this research are addressed as a matter of priority.

          <p><strong>*S1M-2538.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: 'Our National 
            Health' - Delivering Change</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
            (S1M-2538) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;regrets the lack of progress by the Executive 
            in delivering improvements in patient care and public health despite 
            the continued efforts of NHS staff, and calls upon the Executive to 
            embark upon an accelerated programme of reform in the NHS that will 
            reduce bureaucracy, enhance local control, remove institutional barriers 
            to better patient care, strengthen the primary care system and ensure 
            that the NHS has sufficient capacity to deliver major reductions in 
            waiting times.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2538.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: 'Our National 
            Health' - Delivering Change</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
            (S1M-2538) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;the 
            Executive&quot; to end and insert &quot;NHS staff towards delivering 
            the commitments in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan 
            for change</i> but recognises that without radical increases in resources 
            to deliver significantly increased wages and improved conditions for 
            the thousands of currently low-paid health workers, delivery on longer-term 
            goals including major reductions in waiting times and significant 
            public health improvement will not be possible; further agrees on 
            the urgent need for a new National Health minimum wage to attract 
            and retain NHS staff currently underpaid and undervalued; agrees that 
            all private hospitals should now be incorporated into the public sector 
            with financial compensation only on terms of proven need and that 
            consultants&#146; and others&#146; contracts should be renegotiated 
            to prevent any more moon-lighting in the private sector which is a 
            divisive, corrosive and counter-productive influence in our national 
            health service; reaffirms our central belief in a first-class public 
            health service free at point of use for every citizen regardless of 
            income, paid through progressive general taxation, and rejects the 
            further privatisation of health care through the Trojan horse of poor-value 
            PFI schemes.&quot;</p>

            and further notes the rising crisis in staff morale and retention 
            in the health service together with the delays in obtaining consultant 
            assessment and the continuing inability of the Scottish Executive 
            to effect meaningful devolution of funding and decision making to
