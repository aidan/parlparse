<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Green Party Debate: Replacement of Trident&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3866</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Replacement of Trident</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the United Kingdom should not seek to replace the Trident nuclear missile system;&nbsp;notes that in 2005 the UK Government reaffirmed its commitment to all its obligations under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 1967 (NPT), including its legally binding obligation to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good faith;&nbsp;agrees with the legal opinion of Rabinder Singh QC and Professor Christine Chinkin of Matrix Chambers on 19 December 2005 that any replacement of the Trident system would constitute a material breach of Article VI of the NPT, and calls on the Scottish Executive to seek an early assurance from the UK Government that it will fully comply with our legal obligations in respect of the NPT and that it will not seek to replace the Trident nuclear missile system with another weapon system of mass destruction. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3866.4</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Replacement of Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3866) in the name of Chris Ballance, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that in 2005 the UK Government reaffirmed its commitment to all its obligations under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 1967; notes the commitment of all three major UK parties to retain an independent nuclear deterrent; notes the comments of the UK Government that no decisions on replacing Trident have yet been taken; believes there should be the fullest possible public debate on any decision to replace the Trident nuclear weapons system, considering all possible options including non-replacement; notes the significant reductions in the United Kingdom&rsquo;s nuclear weapons arsenal; is committed to the goal of the global elimination of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, and wishes to see the United Kingdom continue to work both bilaterally and through the United Nations to urge states not yet party to non-proliferation instruments to become so, to remain committed to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and to make further progress toward significant reductions in the nuclear arsenals of the major nuclear powers.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-3866.1</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Replacement of Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3866) in the name of Chris Ballance, insert at end &quot;and believes that the best way to ensure that nuclear weapons are removed from Scotland is for Scotland to become an independent nation.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-3866.2</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: Replacement of Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3866) in the name of Chris Ballance, leave out from &quot;that the United Kingdom&quot; to end and insert &quot;it essential that the United Kingdom should continue to play a full and effective role in the world and in NATO and that to do that requires the continuation of an effective defence capacity; notes that as long as other countries have nuclear weapons it is essential that Britain has the capacity to address that threat; supports the principle of replacing or updating the current Trident system with a successor generation nuclear deterrent when necessary; believes that there should be an objective of multilateral global nuclear disarmament, and further believes that, however, that objective can only safely be achieved by ensuring that no rogue dictatorships have the capacity to use nuclear weaponry unchallenged.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-3866.3</strong> <strong>Euan Robson: Replacement of Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3866) in the name of Chris Ballance, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;wishes to see the worldwide elimination of nuclear weapons; notes the UK Government&rsquo;s commitment, made in June 2005, to reach a decision on the replacement of the Trident system by the end of the current Westminster Parliament; further notes that the Secretary of State for Defence stated in June 2005 that &quot;no decision on any replacement for Trident has been taken, either in principle or otherwise&quot;; calls on the UK Government to publish a White Paper on the issue in order to stimulate a full public debate; further calls on the UK Government to press for a new round of multilateral arms reduction talks, and believes that the UK&rsquo;s current minimum nuclear deterrent should be retained for the foreseeable future until sufficient progress has been made towards the global elimination of nuclear weapons.&quot; </p>
 
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Green Party Debate: Pledge Against New Nuclear Power Stations in Scotland&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4329</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Pledge Against New Nuclear Power Stations in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the interim report of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) which states &quot;CoRWM takes no position on the desirability or otherwise of nuclear new build. We believe that future decisions on new build should be subject to their own assessment process&quot;; further notes that government advisors on sustainable development have reported that&nbsp;there are issues other than waste management that should rule out new nuclear power, including risk of accident, terrorist threat, security of supply, economic cost and the availability of safe, clean and economic renewable energy and energy efficiency measures; recognises the opposition to nuclear new build in Scotland by the Green, SNP, SSP and Liberal Democrat parties; notes in particular that Nicol Stephen MSP recently stated&nbsp; &quot;The Liberal Democrats have a tough, clear and consistent position across the UK&hellip;.We oppose new nuclear power.... &nbsp;the Liberal Democrats remain determined to oppose this year, next year and every year&quot;, and calls on all political parties opposed to new nuclear power stations in Scotland to pledge that they will not be part of, or support, a Scottish Executive that allows new nuclear power stations to be built, even if the issue of nuclear waste management may be considered to have been resolved. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-4329.3</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Pledge Against New Nuclear Power Stations in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4329) in the name of Shiona Baird, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;appreciates the work of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management; welcomes the position statement on its draft recommendations published by the committee on 27 April 2006; agrees that the review of options for the long-term management of radioactive waste, currently being undertaken by the committee, is the correct means of engaging Scotland on the crucial issue of finding a long-term management option for higher activity radioactive waste, and notes the Executive&rsquo;s position, as outlined in the Partnership Agreement, that it will not support the further development of nuclear power stations while waste management issues remain unresolved.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-4329.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Pledge Against New Nuclear Power Stations in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4329) in the name of Shiona Baird, insert at end &quot;and therefore agrees that no nuclear power stations should be built in Scotland.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-4329.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Pledge Against New Nuclear Power Stations in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4329) in the name of Shiona Baird, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that Scotland needs a balanced energy policy to meet the energy needs of the nation, including a mixture of generation from a range of technologies, including coal, oil, gas, renewables and nuclear; further believes that our energy policy must support sustainable economic growth while simultaneously fighting against fuel poverty, and believes that the decisions on the future make-up of our energy provision, which should include a nuclear component, need to be made now.&quot; </p>
