          <p><strong>*S2M-705</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Counterdrift 
            Index</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continued loss of population 
            from rural and island areas and its harmful effects on many communities; 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to create a &quot;Counterdrift Index&quot; 
            that sets out the details of its achievements in tackling this issue, 
            and considers that the index, published quarterly, should flag up 
            all relevant indicators including the number of affordable houses 
            built and public jobs dispersed to areas of depopulation, the amount 
            of land transferred for community use from both public and private 
            sectors, the number of modern apprenticeships turned into permanent 
            sustainable jobs and incentives delivered for tradespeople to work 
            in the affected areas.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-704</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>End 
            to Energy Disconnections for Debt</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the continuing increase in the level of disconnection 
            from energy supply due to debt in Scotland, 735 for the first nine 
            months of 2003 compared to 40 in total for 2001; is concerned that 
            with expected price rises this problem will be exacerbated; recognises 
            that disconnection is the most extreme form of fuel poverty and that 
            its continuation compromises the Scottish Executive's and Her Majesty's 
            Government's aim to end fuel poverty; believes that this is unacceptable 
            and supports Energywatch's call to end disconnections for debt, and 
            congratulates Mark Lazarowicz MP for seeking to end this archaic practice 
            through the forthcoming Energy Bill, providing legal protection for 
            the most vulnerable in society.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-703</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Schools 
            Junior Debating Competition</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            <em>The Courier </em>and the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland 
            for their sponsorship of the Schools Junior Debating Competition; 
            recognises the value of the competition in encouraging debate and 
            engagement on the issues of the day amongst participants as a part 
            of their educational experience; thanks the many schools throughout 
            Scotland participating in the competition for giving the opportunity 
            to their pupils, and wishes each team success.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-702#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School</strong>-That the Parliament 
            regrets the decision of Stirling Council's ruling Labour administration 
            to close Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School in the top of the town 
            area of the city; notes that the council has failed to listen to the 
            wishes of parents, the local community and those involved in the school 
            as recorded in its report on its own consultation exercise; believes 
            that Stirling Council has therefore failed to make an adequate case 
            for the closure of the school, and further believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should use its powers over the closure of denominational 
            schools to ask the council to find a way to keep the school open.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-701#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Coca 
            Cola Sponsorship of UK Charts</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            grave concern that Coca Cola has signed a sponsorship deal with the 
            official UK charts company that will lead to the BBC mentioning the 
            sponsor in every &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and Radio 1 &quot;Chart 
            Show&quot; broadcast; further notes that this product placement will 
            effectively promote and advertise the drink to the millions of young 
            people who watch and listen to these shows and that this is happening 
            despite a voluntary undertaking from Coca Cola to cease targeting 
            its products at under-12s; believes that the BBC has seriously breached 
            its public broadcasting duties by agreeing to the terms of the sponsorship 
            agreement and that voluntary regulation by the fast food manufacturers 
            has patently failed, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            introduce statutory regulation to curb the influence of advertising 
            in promoting unhealthy diets to our children.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-700#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Roads 
            Maintenance in Stirling District</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the research submitted in November 2003 by the AA Motoring Trust to 
            the Parliament's Local Government and Transport Committee on roads 
            maintenance expenditure in Scotland; notes from the research that 
            Stirling Council spent a total of £5.1 million less on its local roads 
            network in the period from 2001 to 2003 than it received in central 
            government grant, in contrast to the majority of Scottish councils 
            who spent more than they received; further notes that the council's 
            own scrutiny group published research in February 2003 showing that 
            £9.8 million would have been invested in local roads had the local 
            authority and its predecessor Central Region spent their full allocation 
            from central government over the previous six years; acknowledges 
            that Stirling's current Labour administration has consistently rejected 
            alternative budget proposals to spend more on roads, and believes 
            that Stirling Council should acknowledge the extent of the problem 
            and recognise that it needs a fundamental change in policy on this 
            matter.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-699</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Vulnerable 
            Witnesses (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that 
            the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill be passed.</P>

          <p></P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-698</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Primary 
            Medical Services (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees 
            that the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill be passed.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-697.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Financial 
            Powers of the Parliament</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-697) 
            in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;making&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;acquiring additional powers to tax as well 
            as spend would allow the Parliament to make the Scottish taxation 
            structure much more progressive, begin the process of tackling the 
            inequalities of wealth in Scotland and ending poverty; recognises, 
            however, that fiscal autonomy alone would not overcome the serious 
            distortions of the Scottish economy caused by our being part of the 
            United Kingdom and will not allow the Parliament to stop the profligate 
            expenditure of the UK government on immoral and illegal wars against 
            the wishes of its people, nor the ongoing expenditure on weapons of 
            mass destruction as typified by nuclear weapons at Faslane, and that 
            it would still have insufficient fiscal powers to broaden its tax 
            base and invigorate its economy and culture by adopting a policy of 
            welcoming to Scotland the asylum seekers and other immigrants whom 
            it requires, and further agrees that only an independent Scotland 
            will give the Parliament the powers to tackle these economic and social 
            issues.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-697.2</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Financial 
            Powers of the Parliament</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-697) 
            in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;notes that it will only regain the confidence 
            of the people of Scotland if it addresses the issues of most concern 
            to them and that we must therefore concentrate on improving our public 
            services, strengthening our economy and tackling crime; recognises 
            nevertheless that the relative responsibilities of the Parliament 
            and Westminster, including the financial relationship, should be the 
            subject of review in light of experience; calls for such a review 
            to be conducted within the context of making the devolved settlement 
            work better and thereby strengthening the United Kingdom, and believes 
            that the most appropriate mechanism for such a review would be a Royal 
            Commission or similar independent inquiry appointed by the UK government.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-697.3</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Financial 
            Powers of the Parliament</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-697)

            to end and insert, &quot;the significant benefit that Scotland gains 
            from being part of the United Kingdom and notes that public expenditure 
            in Scotland is at record levels and that this is helping to deliver 
            the commitments in the Partnership Agreement to &quot;growing Scotland's 
            economy; delivering excellent public services, supporting stronger,

            in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to 
            end and insert &quot;notes the continuing improvement in bathing water 
            quality in Scotland but believes that further progress is now dependent 
            on addressing the limitations of Scottish Water and the planning system.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-695.2</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Protecting

            in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to 
            end and insert &quot;recognises the dearth of designated bathing beaches 
            in Scotland in comparison with our European neighbours; notes the 
            continuing lack of powers of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency 
            to impose substantial fines on polluters; notes the detrimental effect 
            that poor bathing water quality has on the Scottish tourist industry, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement a water protection 
            strategy that covers all aspects of water pollution including chemical 
            and radioactive pollution.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-695.3</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> 
            <strong>Protecting Bathing Water Quality</strong>-As an amendment

            to end and insert &quot;but believes that this is only one component 
            in a larger concern about the marine environment that must be addressed 
            urgently if the commitment to improving Scotland's natural environment 
            overall is to be realised.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-695.4</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Protecting 
            Bathing Water Quality</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-695) 
            in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to 
            end and insert &quot;notes that while 2003 represents a record year 
            for compliance with the Bathing Water Directive, some of Scotland's 
            best bathing locations still fail to meet minimum standards; notes 
            that compliance with the higher standards required by a revised European 
            Directive will place further demands upon Scottish Water, the Scottish 
            Environment Protection Agency and other bodies with responsibilities 
            for water quality; further notes that other legislation also impacts 
            on Scotland's bathing water quality, and urges the Scottish Executive 
            to be mindful of these considerations and of the importance of integrated 
            coastal zone management when it consults on the best strategy for 
            protecting and enhancing Scotland's coastline.&quot;</P>

            MEPs to enable the new member states to be represented on an equitable 
            basis; notes the consequent reduction of United Kingdom seats in the 
            European Parliament from 87 to 78, and considers that this is appropriate
