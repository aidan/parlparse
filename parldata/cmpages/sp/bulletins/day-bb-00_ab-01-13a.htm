        the Parliament acknowledges the need for action to provide good quality and accessible
        housing and strong and secure communities; welcomes the Executive&#146;s proposals to
        achieve this through a range of measures including the introduction of a single social
        tenancy, the development of a single regulatory framework for social housing, the
        promotion of a stronger strategic role in housing for local authorities, and a new role
        and status for Scottish Homes, and notes that the Executive will bring forward a Housing
        Bill to deliver these objectives.<i><b> </p>

          motion (S1M-408) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to

          of measures, including the introduction of a single social tenancy, the development of a
          single regulatory framework for social housing, the promotion of a stronger strategic role
          in housing for local authorities, and a new role and status for Scottish Homes, but
          believes that these measures alone will not improve the position of Scotland&#146;s 80000
          homeless people and that the Executive must give greater priority to dealing with chronic
          under investment in Scotland&#146;s public and voluntary housing including the reversal of
          their policy of wholesale stock transfer.&quot; </p>

          achieve this and notes that the Executive will bring forward a Housing Bill; calls upon
          the Executive to include within this Bill measures to deal with the alarming problem of
          homelessness which has increased dramatically since May 1997; welcomes the
          Executive&#146;s commitment to extend the Right to Buy to Housing Association tenants, but
          emphasises that measures may be necessary to safeguard individual Associations where the
          take-up of this right could prejudice the operation, viability or success of these
          Associations.&quot;<b><i></p>
