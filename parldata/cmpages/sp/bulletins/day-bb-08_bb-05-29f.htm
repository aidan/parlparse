<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2009</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Good Example Sent Through Tough Licensing Enforcement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the tough action taken by the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s Licensing Committee in suspending the license of an Edinburgh shopkeeper who was found to be selling alcohol to minors; recognises the importance of licensing law to public safety, particularly in the case of young people as a control on restricted substances; acknowledges that the vast majority of licence holders use their licences responsibly and are let down by a minority of offenders, and calls on other councils to look to Edinburgh&rsquo;s example and take a tough stance on the minority who flaunt licensing law.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2008&diams; </strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Refugee Week Scotland 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 16 to 22 June is Refugee Week Scotland 2008; recognises the indomitable spirit and courage of the world&rsquo;s 14 million refugees who endure enormous suffering without losing hope, finding the strength to overcome despair and start a new life against seemingly overwhelming odds; views Refugee Week as an important platform to promote and celebrate Scotland&rsquo;s proud traditions of providing sanctuary and support which help rebuild shattered lives; further notes that over 70 arts, cultural, sports and educational events will take place across Scotland, including a reception to be held in the Parliament on Wednesday 18 June 2008, which will encourage positive encounters between around 10,000 asylum seekers and refugees in Scotland and their new communities, and values the cultural, social and economic contributions that refugees make to Scottish society.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2007</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Sort it out - Securing the Future of the Postal Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its support for the Communication Workers Union (CWU) in its campaign to protect the future of Royal Mail Group plc and its workers; agrees that the introduction of competition has had seriously negative effects, as outlined by both CWU and the independent review of the process; believes that this is highly relevant after further post office closures have been announced across a swathe of Scotland from Alloa to Aberdeenshire; supports CWU&rsquo;s call for a wholesale examination of the funding package received by Royal Mail Group, and hopes for a conclusion to the current disagreement over employees&rsquo; pensions between the Royal Mail Group and CWU that is rapid, constructive and successful.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2006</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Pan Africa Chemistry Network</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the initiative of the Royal Society of Chemistry and Syngenta in launching the Pan Africa Chemistry Network which, with the first regional hub in Kenya, will eventually span the entire continent; recognises that the chemical sciences are vitally important in developing the economies of African countries, as well as tackling issues such as food security and sustainability, clean water and disease prevention, and believes that this network will enable better technology transfer and skills development as well as encouraging young people to study chemistry and other sciences.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2005</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Dog Rental Companies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the intention of dog rental company, FlexPetz, to expand to various cities across the United Kingdom, including Glasgow, in 2008; acknowledges that the UK dog rental business is currently very small but recognises the potential for its growth due to the increase in fashion accessory dogs; disapproves of causing distress to dogs as a result of being rented out to numerous people; believes that this encourages irresponsible attitudes to dog ownership; further believes that dog renting is, or should be, a breach of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 in that it is highly likely to inhibit dogs from having the ability to exhibit normal behaviour patterns; disapproves of renting dogs for profit, and calls on the Scottish Government to take action to ensure compliance with the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and to consider the banning of dog rental companies in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2004</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Routes Out of Prison Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &pound;2 million National Lottery grant for the Routes Out of Prison scheme in which ex-offenders work with short-term offenders to prepare them for integration into the community before their release from prison; hopes that the national rollout of the scheme will make a real difference to Scotland&rsquo;s reoffending statistics, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to ensure that cutting reoffending is a key priority for the Scottish Government.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2002.1</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Common Agricultural Policy Health Check</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2002) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;but, in so doing, notes the importance of consulting on the potential impact of progressive modulation on Scottish farms and affirms that any increases in European Union-wide modulation should be matched by a corresponding deduction in levels of voluntary modulation.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2002.2</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Common Agricultural Policy Health Check</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2002) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;considers that any increase in compulsory modulation must be offset by a corresponding reduction in voluntary modulation to ensure that Scottish producers are not put at a competitive disadvantage within the European Union; further considers that Scotland, with its high proportion of large farm units, must not be disadvantaged by proposals for progressive modulation or capping; believes that, in light of rapidly escalating food and fuel costs, the Scottish Rural Development Programme should be reviewed, with the production of food and food security considered as a key priority, and recognises the correlation between economic activity on the ground and delivery of environmental benefits for all.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2002.3</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>Common Agricultural Policy Health Check</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2002) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;with farmers&quot; to end and insert &quot;playing its full part in ensuring the long-term viability of our rural communities and enabling farmers to play their part in achieving the Scottish Government&rsquo;s purpose of sustainable economic growth through food production, high standards of animal welfare and the environmental management of our agricultural land.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2001.1</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Moving Scotland Forward</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2001) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;is concerned that the First Minister&rsquo;s statement on Moving Scotland Forward lacked substance, failed to justify the many promises broken by the SNP over the last 12 months and failed to address the long-term issues facing Scotland; welcomes the cross-party initiatives to tackle problems related to drugs, alcohol and tobacco, the commitment to drive forward the previous administration&rsquo;s Curriculum for Excellence and the pilot scheme on environmental information; calls for a substantial extension of the bodies covered by the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002; believes that the statement was a missed opportunity to bring forward a coherent energy strategy; calls for the introduction of a minimum income guarantee for students, and further calls on the Scottish Government to empower children and young people to have the best possible start in life by attacking the causes of early disadvantage.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2001.2</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Moving Scotland Forward</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2001) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;condemns the self-congratulation and lack of positive policies for the future in the First Minster&rsquo;s statement on Moving Scotland Forward on 14 May 2008; recognises the many SNP broken promises on a whole range of manifesto commitments, from dumping student debt to providing a &pound;2,000 grant to first-time buyers, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward substantive policies to address climate change, skills development, affordable housing shortages, health inequalities and the other big challenges that confront Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1993</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s First Tidal Device on National Grid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the creation and development of the OpenHydro tidal device situated in the waters off Eday, Orkney, which is the first such tidal device to produce energy for the National Grid in Scotland; recognises this achievement as a major milestone in the development of marine renewable energy in Scotland and considers it to be a triumph for Irish company OpenHydro and the European Marine Energy Centre; looks forward to an era of greater development of tidal devices which will make a huge contribution of clean, green energy to the nation, and further anticipates the economic spin-offs which will accrue to communities on both sides of the Pentland Firth as well as further afield.</p>
