          <p><strong>*S2M-148</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Pay Bargaining 
            in the NHS</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the unanimous 
            decision of the UNISON Scotland health conference to pursue a fully 
            devolved and democratic bargaining machinery for NHS staff in Scotland, 
            its rejection of the UK-wide proposals contained in <em>Agenda for 
            Change - Modernising the NHS Pay System </em>and its determination 
            to achieve a negotiated settlement in Scotland for NHS workers and 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to give a commitment to maintaining 
            current agreements in relation to the principles of lifetime protection 
            and no detriment as a result of organisational change, establish discussions 
            with the relevant trade unions in order to establish a proper Scottish 
            bargaining machinery and seek to negotiate an alternative to the proposals 
            in <em>Agenda for Change - Modernising the NHS Pay System </em>that 
            is acceptable specifically to the NHS workforce in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-147#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Foot-and-Mouth 
            Disease Recovery Funding</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            excellent use made by Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders tourist 
            boards of the additional funding allocated to them by the Scottish 
            Executive, through VisitScotland, to help the tourism industry recover 
            from the effects of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and considers 
            that VisitScotland should release the third and final tranche of this 
            funding.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-146</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Combat Stress</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament commends the work carried out by the charitable organisation 
            Combat Stress in helping to provide treatment for ex-service personnel 
            suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); acknowledges 
            that PTSD is a pervasive illness that can affect every aspect of a 
            person&#146;s life, that prevents people from functioning properly, 
            making even activities of daily living difficult, and that interferes 
            with normal relationships, causing disharmony and breakdown of marriages 
            and friendships and often leaving the victim socially isolated and 
            family and friends badly affected as well; notes the comments made 
            in the Parliament by the First Minister and others prior to, and during, 
            the recent war in Iraq about supporting our troops and believes that 
            this support should continue when military personnel return from war 
            zones and once they leave the forces; deplores the fact that Combat 
            Stress is left each year with a large funding gap as it only receives 
            funding from clients who receive more than a 30% war pension despite 
            providing medical help to men and women who are suffering psychological 
            trauma due to their experiences in the forces, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to review this situation to ensure that Combat Stress receives 
            proper recompense for the specialist medical services it provides 
            to a specialist group, both those on war pensions and those not, and 
            to investigate the much more comprehensive services provided to ex-service 
            personnel and their families in Australia, America, Canada and the 
            Netherlands to ensure that those who join our armed forces are able 
            to get help and support when they need it after they leave the service.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-145#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: Obesity Amongst 
            the Scottish Population</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the findings of the recent study carried out by Dr Andrew 
            Walker of the University of Glasgow, <em>The Cost of Doing Nothing 
            &#150; the economics of obesity in Scotland</em>; recognises that 
            an estimated 21% of adults are now obese and that the annual cost 
            to the NHS of obesity and obesity-related illnesses has been estimated 
            at £171 million; acknowledges the efforts of the Scottish Executive 
            and health care providers in attempting to address this problem, in 
            particular those of Coatbridge Local Healthcare Co-operative whose 
            &quot;Weigh-In Without Women&quot; programme recently received the 
            National Obesity Forum award for excellence in weight management, 
            and considers that such examples of best practice could be rolled 
            out across the country as part of a comprehensive multidisciplinary 
            approach to tackling this problem.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-144</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: The Draft Water Industry 
            (Scotland) Act 2002 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2003</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament agrees that the draft Water Industry (Scotland) Act 
            2002 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2003 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-143</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: The Draft Landfill 
            (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            agrees that the draft Landfill (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2003 
            be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-142</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: The Draft Budget 
            (Scotland) Act 2003 Amendment Order 2003</strong>&#151;That the Finance 
            Committee recommends that the draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2003 Amendment 
            Order 2003 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-141</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Review of Licensing 
            Fees</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns the fact that of Aberdeen 
            City Council's taxpayers have to subsidise the council's licensing 
            board to the tune of £184,000 each year and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to review licensing fees so that the licensed trade pays, 
            in full, for the costs incurred by licensing boards.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-140#</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: Red Brae School</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament commends the experienced staff at Red Brae School, 
            Maybole, who provide an alternative education path for pupils excluded 
            from mainstream education for disruptive and undisciplined behaviour; 
            acknowledges the benefits of this education which the pupils themselves 
            appreciate, and believes that the Scottish Executive must ensure that 
            such facilities are available across the country thereby ensuring 
            that those children whose behaviour patterns are not suited to mainstream 
            education are catered for in a way that steers them into becoming 
            useful and respected members of society. </p>

            Margaret Mitchell<strong>*</strong>, Mr Ted Brocklebank<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-139</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Famous Grouse Experience, 
            Glenturret Distillery, Crieff</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Famous Grouse Experience at the Glenturret Distillery, Crieff, 
            on celebrating its first anniversary; welcomes the increase in visitor 
            numbers and the financial boost that this tourist attraction has brought 
            to the Crieff and Perthshire tourist industry, and notes the importance 
            of the whisky industry to the tourist economy and the need to develop 
            improved visitor attractions that focus on traditional Scottish industries.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-138#</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Nursery Nurses</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament considers that there should be a speedy resolution 
            to the long-standing issues relating to pay and qualifications in 
            the early years and childcare sector; notes the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
            failure, over a prolonged period, to address the situation, and recognises 
            the need for an interim solution in terms of increased pay for nursery 
            nurses across the board as well as a longer-term review.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-137</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: Health and Social 
            Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament endorses the principle of ensuring consistency in recovery 
            of NHS charges where compensation is paid following injury as set 
            out in Part 3 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and 
            Standards) Bill and agrees that the relevant provisions to achieve 
            this end including extending ministers&#146; powers to make regulations 
            under a scheme for recovery should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-136</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Fireworks Bill - UK 
            Legislation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament endorses the principle 
            of making enabling regulations for the supply and use of fireworks 
            as set out in the Fireworks Bill and agrees that those provisions 
            in the Bill that relate to devolved matters should be considered by 
            the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-135#</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne: Industrial Action 
            at Grampian TV</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses concern 
            at the prospect of industrial action at Grampian TV and considers 
            that all sides should show restraint while negotiations to find an 
            amicable solution continue.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, 
            Alex Johnstone<strong>*</strong>, John Scott<strong>*</strong>, Margaret 
            Mitchell<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-134#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Pet Passports</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the ongoing discussions between the Scottish 
            Executive, officials from the State Veterinary Service and Superfast 
            Ferries regarding the introduction of a pet passport scheme on the 
            Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry route; recognises the great demand for such 
            a scheme, not just from pet owners, but also from organisations such 
            as Guide Dogs for the Blind and Hearing Dogs for the Deaf; believes 
            that a pet passport scheme would greatly increase the attraction of 
            this route by allowing hundreds of Scottish pet owners to travel to 
            mainland Europe with their pets directly from Scotland, and considers 
            that the Executive should do everything in its power to assist the 
            implementation of the pet passport scheme in Scotland as quickly as 
            possible.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-133</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: National Diabetes 
            Week: 8 to 14 June 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            approximately 150,000 people in Scotland have been diagnosed with 
            diabetes; further notes that it is estimated that another 90,000 people 
            in Scotland remain undiagnosed; recognises that diabetes accounts 
            for about 5% of NHS costs, which equates to £320 million in Scotland 
            annually, and that the incidence of type 1 diabetes in Scotland is 
            24 per 100,000 per year in the under-15 population and one of the 
            highest incidence rates in the world; notes that early diagnosis reduces 
            the risk of developing life-threatening complications and that 33% 
            more people with diabetes die from coronary heart disease in Scotland 
            each year than in the rest of the United Kingdom, and therefore urges 
            the Scottish Executive to raise public awareness of the seriousness 
            of diabetes, thus increasing early detection, to promote screening 
            programmes for those most at risk, to eliminate post-code variable 
            treatment and to take as an example the life of Janet Scott, who has 
            had insulin injections for 70 years and, as a healthy and fit 72 year 
            old, walks 5 miles each day. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-132</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Queen's Golden 
            Jubilee Award to Central Gurdwara Singh Sabha, Glasgow</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates the Central Gurdwara Singh Sabha in Glasgow 
            for being one of 20 Scottish voluntary organisations that have achieved 
            the annual Queen's Golden Jubilee Award for outstanding commitment 
            and contribution to their community and welcomes the recognition given 
            in this award to an important ethnic minority organisation serving 
            the Sikh community in Glasgow.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-131</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Showcasing of Young 
            Bands in Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the comments 
            made by Oasis musician Noel Gallagher that one of his best ever nights 
            out was in Partick, Glasgow; notes that his musical career was launched 
            in Glasgow after the band was signed to Creation Records following 
            a gig in the city's King Tut's venue; further notes the increasing 
            difficulties faced by young bands in Glasgow and throughout Scotland 
            in getting gigs and a breakthrough in the music industry, and calls 
            on Noel Gallagher to return to Partick to host a showcase event for 
            young Glasgow talent.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>S2M-128</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: Books for Baghdad</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates the University of Edinburgh and the <em>Sunday 
            Herald</em> for launching its &quot;Books for Baghdad&quot; project 
            aimed at restocking Iraq&#146;s looted university libraries; notes 
            with sadness that the University of Baghdad alone lost 600,000 books; 
            further notes, with pleasure, that this project has attracted considerable 
            support, and urges the Scottish Executive to make a financial contribution 
            to it as a positive formal gesture of support on behalf of the Scottish 
            nation.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-125</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Road Safety</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament believes that the cause of road safety in Scotland 
            would be aided by vehicles keeping their lights on at all times in 
            order to aid visibility and asks that future road safety campaigns 
            include this as a sensible contribution that all drivers can make 
            to the reduction of accidents.</p>

            the Parliament notes the recommendations by the Committee on the Safety 
            of Medicines regarding the prescribing of seroxat to those aged under 
            18, which have called for this drug not to be prescribed to those 
            suffering from depression, and notes that seroxat is not licensed 
            for use by under-18s and has been reportedly the cause of high levels 
            of self-harm and suicidal behaviour.</p>

            notes that Heart Week is from 7 to 15 June 2003; commends the work 
            of Scottish H.A.R.T. (Heart at Risk Testing), a Borders-based national 
            charity that researches into all heart diseases, especially cardiomyopathy, 
            raises funds for a mobile screening unit which, with trained staff,

            still take place in the 21st century, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should urgently investigate the operation of lap-dancing 
            clubs to ascertain whether there are any connections with organised 
            crime and take whatever action is necessary to end the exploitation 
            and trafficking of women.</p>

            British Airways will be withdrawing Concorde aircraft from service 
            and welcomes the approach from the Chairman of the Trustees of the 
            National Museums of Scotland to the Chief Executive of British Airways 
            requesting that one of these aeroplanes is donated to the Museum of 
            Flight at East Fortune; recognises the interests of education and 
            tourism and the important role that museums play in both of these 
            areas; takes into account the associations of Concorde with Scotland, 
            namely that the design of the wings was undertaken by a Scot from 
            Penicuik, Sir James Arnot Hamilton, that the early test flights were 
            carried out at Prestwick in the early 1970s and that it was Concorde 
            that flew over Edinburgh to celebrate the opening of the Scottish 
            Parliament in July 1999; further recognises the wealth of experience 
            of staff at the Museum of Flight in the preservation of aircraft and 
            their years of experience in welcoming visitors to the museum; further 
            notes that staff at the Museum of Flight are confident that the practicalities 
            of landing a Concorde aircraft and of providing enclosed space for 
            display have been investigated and that no difficulties are anticipated 
            following a brief period of minor works; notes that the National Museums 
            of Scotland has recently appointed a new General Manager at the Museum 
            of Flight and that a major programme of development is planned to 
            position the museum as a world class attraction, and recommends strongly 
            that support be given to the National Museums of Scotland in its bid 
            for Concorde for display at the Museum of Flight. </p>

            <em>The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom:

            £1.1 billion, £200 million less than government estimates, and that 
            the cost of upgrading Edinburgh Airport would be £1.3 billion, £400 
            million more than previous estimates; further notes the massive investment 
            planned for airport expansion in the south east of England; expresses 
            its support for Scottish Airports Ltd&#146;s call on Her Majesty&#146;s

            at risk by opting to develop only one of the country&#146;s main airports, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations 
            to Her Majesty&#146;s Government to ensure that the necessary investment 
            is made available to ensure that both airports grow to their full
