<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1840</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Vulnerable Paying the Price of SNP Populism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with both concern and regret the cuts in frontline services across Scotland, including nurseries, cr&egrave;ches, services for the housebound and infirm and funding for voluntary sector organisations, including those caring for some of Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable citizens, arising from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget passed with Conservative support in Holyrood and its subsequent concordat with local government, including a freeze in Council Tax; notes the <em>Evening News&rsquo; </em>comment of 29 April 2008 that &quot;since then the chickens have come home to roost and despite predictable crowing in council chambers the length and breadth of the country that frontline services would be protected from the cuts, predictably this has not proved possible for most administrations&quot;; further notes that such predictions by opposition MSPs were dismissed at the time by SNP ministers as &quot;scaremongering&quot;, but believes that the reality on the ground, particularly in areas such as Edinburgh, Aberdeen and East Lothian, has vindicated those who warned of the consequences; is aware that these cuts are being imposed despite the SNP government enjoying a funding settlement twice that available to Donald Dewar as First Minister, and regrets that local authorities which freeze their Council Tax without sufficient funding in place are passing on cuts in services to Scotland&rsquo;s youngest, oldest, poorest and disabled who are paying the price of the SNP&rsquo;s populism.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1839&diams; </strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Family Law Disputes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that current arrangements for settling family law disputes could be improved and that current law still discriminates against parents who are not married; notes that parents can find it difficult or impossible to enforce contact orders where the other parent is unco-operative and that disputes where broken families live in more than one jurisdiction within the United Kingdom are unnecessarily difficult to resolve; further notes that these issues are particularly relevant due to recent cases in the north east; encourages current moves by Scotland&rsquo;s legal profession towards collaborative dispute resolution, and notes with interest the new system of less adversarial trials being developed in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1838</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>International Framework</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of ensuring that Scotland is competitive in an increasingly globalised society; agrees that creating the conditions for talented people to live, learn, visit, work and remain in Scotland is crucial to helping to deliver the goals of growing Scotland&rsquo;s population and economy in a sustainable way, and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s International Framework as a means to extend, focus and align the actions and policies of the government and public sector partners to these ends.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1837</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>The Draft Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992 Amendment Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee recommends that the draft Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992 Amendment Order 2008 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1792</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Viva Madiba Viva!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its best wishes to Nelson Mandela on the occasion of his 90th birthday on 18 July 2008; salutes his lifelong struggle against injustice, poverty and racism and for freedom, democracy and peace for all; welcomes the birthday card and appeal to fund projects in South Africa organised by ACTSA Scotland, the successor to the Scottish Anti-Apartheid Movement, on behalf of the people of Scotland to celebrate this landmark birthday, and hopes that as many civic organisations, voluntary groups, trade unions, elected representatives and individuals as possible take the time to add their names in a message of continuing solidarity with Nelson Mandela and the people of Southern Africa.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1791</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>The Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the value and contribution of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD) in Glasgow to the arts in Scotland and further afield; notes that the RSAMD is Scotland&rsquo;s only national conservatoire of music and drama and a recognised world-class institution producing famous alumni, including the current Dr Who, David Tennant, and acclaimed actors Alan Cumming, James McAvoy, Bill Paterson and Daniella Nardini, as well as renowned musicians, singers, composers and conductors; further notes that the academy has ensured that students have benefited from the high standard of one-on-one tuition which conservatoire teaching provides, despite the fact that drama courses have not been funded by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to conservatoire level; is concerned that this historic underfunding has finally come to a head and is leading to a restructuring exercise among teaching staff which threatens the quality of teaching at the academy, including major changes to staff contracts and a failure to rule out compulsory redundancies, and calls on the Scottish Government to fund the current &pound;600,000 gap and work with the funding council to ensure that drama and music courses are both funded to conservatoire level to ensure that Scotland remains at the centre of international arts provision.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1660#</strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Alternative and Augmentative Communication</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern following the findings by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, Capability Scotland and Augmentative Communication in Practice whose recent survey of alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) equipment and speech and language therapy support provision in Scotland revealed that eight out of 15 NHS boards, including NHS Grampian, are providing a poor service; notes that only 16% of potential beneficiaries are accessing specialist AAC services in Scotland and that AAC provision is a postcode, age, advocacy and impairment lottery, and considers that an AAC strategy for Scotland should be developed and implemented to provide for a national standard of specialist speech and language therapy provision.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1651#</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>RNIB Scotland&rsquo;s Right to Read Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Right to Read campaign by RNIB Scotland for equal access to textbooks and other educational material for blind and visually impaired children; notes the excellent example of schools such as Craigiebarns Primary School in Dundee in ensuring that blind and visually impaired children are included in mainstream schooling; believes that a national transcription service should be established, building on the work done by RNIB, other organisations and local councils; acknowledges that such a service could also be of use to other children with additional support needs, and so believes that prompt action is needed to move forward with this agenda.</p>
