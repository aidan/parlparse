<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Clostridium Difficile Associated Disease in Hospitals&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2524</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Clostridium Difficile Associated Disease in Hospitals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the outbreak of Clostridium difficile at the Vale of Leven Hospital; considers the report from the independent review team to be a helpful starting point but believes that there are still serious questions to be addressed; notes the referral of the report by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to consider what action should be taken; recognises and supports the substantial case made by the families of Clostridium difficile victims for a public inquiry; notes that the Scottish Ministers can instruct such an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 and acknowledges the need for wider lessons to be learned throughout the NHS in Scotland in preventing and tackling Clostridium difficile, and therefore calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to return to the Parliament to make a statement when the views of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal are known. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2524.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Clostridium Difficile Associated Disease in Hospitals</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2524) in the name of Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;and supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;the case made by the families of Clostridium difficile victims for a public inquiry; acknowledges the need for wider lessons to be learned throughout the NHS in Scotland in preventing and tackling Clostridium difficile; notes that Scottish Ministers can instruct a public inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005, and therefore calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to return to the Parliament to make a ministerial statement when the views of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal are known.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: SNP Government Failure on Jobs for Newly-Qualified Teachers&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2525</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>SNP Government Failure on Jobs for Newly-Qualified Teachers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent <em>Times Educational Supplement Scotland</em> and General Teaching Council for Scotland surveys showing an increasing number of post-probationary teachers who are unable to secure a permanent teaching post; believes that this development represents an appalling waste of talent and is grossly unfair to those newly-qualified teachers encouraged to train to join the profession; further notes that this comes at a time when many class sizes are rising, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to show leadership and ensure that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with local authorities, takes early and decisive action to address this growing crisis and to make a ministerial statement before the October recess with recommendations for immediate action. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2525.3</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: SNP Government Failure on Jobs for Newly-Qualified Teachers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2525) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the Scottish Government has set up the Teacher Employment Working Group, due to report in October 2008, which includes members from the General Teaching Council for Scotland, teacher education institutions, COSLA, the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, teacher unions, the headteachers&rsquo; associations and the Scottish Government, to establish whether the long-standing teacher workforce planning process remains fit for purpose. </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2525.1</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith: SNP Government Failure on Jobs for Newly-Qualified Teachers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2525) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;show leadership&quot; to end and insert &quot;make a ministerial statement on this subject as soon as practicable following receipt of the report of the Teacher Employment Working Group.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2525.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: SNP Government Failure on Jobs for Newly-Qualified Teachers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2525) in the name of Rhona Brankin, after &quot;class sizes are rising,&quot; insert &quot;highlighting that the SNP&rsquo;s manifesto commitment to reduce class sizes to 18 in P1 to P3 is in utter chaos, with insufficient funding, a lack of a legal framework and the omission of the policy from 21 out of 32 local authorities&rsquo; single outcome agreements,&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#9;Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-1839</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Family Law Disputes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that current arrangements for settling family law disputes could be improved and that current law still discriminates against parents who are not married; notes that parents can find it difficult or impossible to enforce contact orders where the other parent is unco-operative and that disputes where broken families live in more than one jurisdiction within the United Kingdom are unnecessarily difficult to resolve; further notes that these issues are particularly relevant due to recent cases in the north east; encourages current moves by Scotland&rsquo;s legal profession towards collaborative dispute resolution, and notes with interest the new system of less adversarial trials being developed in Australia. </p>
