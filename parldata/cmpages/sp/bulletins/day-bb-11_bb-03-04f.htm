<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8073 Ian McKee: Nursing Scotland&rsquo;s Future</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal College of Nursing Scotland for its campaign for the Scottish Parliament election, Nursing Scotland&rsquo;s Future; commends the principles on which the campaign is based, to manage money better, manage workforce better and make patient care better; notes the wide level of support that the campaign has gathered from members of the public, nurses, healthcare support workers, other healthcare professionals, MSPs and parliamentary candidates, and urges MSPs who have not yet signed up to the campaign to do so.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8072 Bob Doris: Caldercuilt Youth Forum Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the Caldercuilt Youth Forum on what it considers their tremendous success over the past year in attempting to meet the huge demand for community youth activities in the Maryhill area of Glasgow and extends warm wishes to the youngsters who won awards at the group&rsquo;s first awards ceremony on 1 March 2011, including Robyn Hyslop, Eilidh Booth, Darren Erwin and Christopher Burton for the Senior Contribution Award, Shannon McLean, Connor Milne and James Brown for the Junior Contribution Award and Megan Clark for the Courage Award.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8071 Jamie McGrigor: Murder of Pakistani Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the murder of Shahbaz Bhatti, the Pakistani Minorities Minister, allegedly at the hands of Islamist militants and after he had predicted his own assassination; commends Mr Bhatti&rsquo;s bravery and notes that he was the only Christian minister serving in the Pakistani government and was seen as a champion for all minorities, the non-Muslim Pakistani population, human rights and freedom of speech; condemns violence in all its forms and restates support for democracy, freedom of speech and full human rights including freedom of worship, and sends its condolences to Mr Bhatti&rsquo;s family, friends and supporters in both Pakistan and the United Kingdom at this time.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8070 Jamie Hepburn: Croy Railway Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the official opening of the new park-and-ride facility at Croy railway station by the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, Keith Brown, on Wednesday 23 February 2011; acknowledges that the facility is the biggest of its kind in Scotland and considers that it will greatly improve commuter services, and opposes North Lanarkshire Council&rsquo;s decision to introduce charges for using this as being counterproductive to encouraging people out of the car and on the train.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8069 Jamie McGrigor: Congratulations to the 2011 Scottish Restaurant Award Finalists</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the winners of the 2011 Scottish Restaurant Awards who were named on Monday 28 February 2011; considers that the Highlands and Islands restaurant sector was well represented, with the Isle of Eriska being named Best Hotel Restaurant of the Year, The Three Chimneys, Best Rural Restaurant of the Year and the Lochleven Seafood Caf&eacute;, Seafood Restaurant of the Year; recognises the importance of good food and drink in attracting further tourism to the Highlands and Islands and elsewhere in Scotland; encourages the use of local produce and considers that this has helped the winners of these awards achieve success, and wishes all those involved in these businesses continued success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8068 Claire Baker: Congratulations to Heather MacMillan, Lifetime Diana Award Winner</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glenrothes High School&rsquo;s Head Girl, Heather MacMillan, on receiving a lifetime Diana Award; considers that she takes a selfless and caring approach toward others both in school and in the wider community and commends her for it, and recognises the very positive work undertaken by young people like Heather MacMillan who are committed to helping others in every way possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8067 Cathy Peattie: Centenary of International Women&rsquo;s Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the many events being organised throughout the world to mark International Women&rsquo;s Day on 8 March 2011, including the event in the Parliament on Saturday 5 March, celebrating A Century of Aspirations, Achievement and Advancement; notes that the first International Women&rsquo;s Day was held on 19 March 1911, with over a million women and men attending rallies campaigning for an end to discrimination and for women&rsquo;s rights to vote, hold office, work and training; notes also the publication in 1911 of <em>Bread and Roses</em>, which has become an anthem for the international women&rsquo;s movement; considers that there are still many aspects of women&rsquo;s rights, representation and welfare that need to be addressed through a gendered policy approach, including the gender pay gap, the underrepresentation of women in senior positions in the public and private sectors and as elected representatives, and with regard to the provision of violence-against-women support services, and reaffirms its support for International Women&rsquo;s Day and its commitment to tackling discrimination, implementing the gender equality duty and securing equality for women throughout Scottish society.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8066 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Twestival Local 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament highlights Twestival Local 2011, which will take place in cities around the world on 24 March; considers that Twestival uses social media for social good by connecting communities on a single day to highlight a great cause, have a fun event and raise important funds, and notes that Edinburgh&rsquo;s Local Twestival, EdTwestival, will be backing St Columba&rsquo;s Hospice with a music gig featuring local artists from across the musical genres.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8065 Bob Doris: Clockwork Orange, Keeping Glasgow Moving</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that it is estimated that up to 100,000 extra passengers used the Glasgow subway system during the month of December 2010 as a result of inclement weather conditions, which hampered many overground transport services in the city; commends the SPT staff team for rising to the challenge of keeping Glasgow moving during the severe weather; believes that this displays the reliance that many Glaswegians put on the subway system, which it considers would greatly benefit from modernisation, and looks forward to positive support from the Scottish Government to appropriately back SPT Subway to allow the modernisation plan to proceed.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-8064 Sandra White: 21st Century Universities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the submission to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on higher education by a number of academics expressing concern over the way in which universities are currently run and managed and calling for the influence of senior management to be reduced; further considers that the submission suggests that the powers of the university court and senate have been eroded by the emergence of executive management groups within which strategic decisions are made in the absence of widespread consultation; believes that this erosion is evidenced by the current lack of transparency and openness surrounding the University of Glasgow&rsquo;s proposed cuts to a number of its courses; considers that Scotland&rsquo;s universities must take action to ensure that they adhere to modern democratic levels of openness, transparency and inclusion, and calls on the universities themselves to take the lead in effecting these changes.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-8061 Fiona Hyslop: Scotland Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Scotland is best served by a Scottish Parliament that has the full range of powers and responsibilities necessary to improve Scotland&rsquo;s economic performance and promote sustainable economic growth; agrees that the current provisions of the Scotland Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 30 November 2010, do not provide those powers and responsibilities; recognises the improvements to the Bill suggested by the Scotland Bill Committee but is of the view that these are not sufficient either to provide the financial responsibility that Scotland needs nor to address the flaws in the Bill; nevertheless agrees that the UK Parliament should consider the following parts of the Bill: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(a) the transfer of legislative competence to the Scottish Parliament for the control of airguns (clause 11); and</p>
  <p>(b) consents to the transfer of legislative competence to the Scottish Parliament for stamp duty land tax and landfill tax (clauses 28 to 31);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>further agrees that the UK Parliament should consider the following parts of the Bill providing that the amendments specified are made to the Bill: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(c) the provisions that provide executive competence to the Scottish Ministers, on condition that the Bill is amended:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) to transfer legislative competence to the Scottish Parliament over the administration of elections to the Scottish Parliament, speed limits, drink-driving limits and licensing to treat addiction in addition to the transfer of executive competence to the Scottish Ministers (clauses 1 to 3, 19 to 22);</p>
    <p>(ii) to devolve legislative competence for the Crown Estate in Scotland to the Scottish Parliament (clause 18); and</p>
    <p>(iii) to devolve responsibility for the appointment of the Scottish Member of the BBC Trust to the Scottish Ministers subject to the agreement of the Parliament (clause 17); and</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(d) the following finance provisions, on condition that the Bill is amended to provide full financial responsibility for the Scottish Parliament:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) full legislative competence over all taxation (other than VAT) and over all benefits and tax credits (clauses 24 to 27);</p>
    <p>(ii) power for the Scottish Government to borrow for capital investment on a prudential basis with flexibility to manage a portfolio of borrowing from both the UK Treasury and other sources, spreading the cost and risk of Scotland&rsquo;s capital investment programme (clause 32); and</p>
    <p>(iii) the ability for the Scottish Government to borrow for revenue purposes so as to enable an effective response to the natural volatility in tax revenues and to manage public expenditure across economic cycles in the same manner as any fiscally responsible government (clause 32);</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>further agrees that the UK Parliament should not consider the following parts of the Bill:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(e) the removal of the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament for corporate insolvency and the regulation of health professions (clauses 12 and 13);</p>
  <p>(f) the provisions to provide UK Ministers with powers to implement international obligations in devolved areas without the consent of the Scottish Parliament (clause 23); and</p>
  <p>(g) the provisions for partial suspension of Acts subject to scrutiny by the Supreme Court (clause 7);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>further agrees that, as planned amendments to the Bill in relation to the Lord Advocate and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) have not been published or subject to public scrutiny, the Scottish Parliament cannot consent to these proposals at this time; further agrees that, in light of the lack of detail for key aspects of the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals, the Bill should be amended to require the consent of the Scottish Parliament before provisions are commenced; further agrees that the UK Parliament should consider the remainder of the Bill; further agrees that, given the amendments requested by the Scottish Parliament, the incoming Scottish Parliament should consider the Bill as amended by the UK Parliament, and confirms the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s consent to the Bill.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-8060 Willie Coffey: The King&rsquo;s Speech and Speech and Language Therapy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of the film,<em> The King&rsquo;s Speech</em>, which tells the story of King George VI&rsquo;s battle to overcome a stammer, at a variety of awards ceremonies, most recently receiving four Oscars, including for best film and best original screenplay; notes that the writer, David Seidler, was motivated to write the story of the king&rsquo;s treatment after himself overcoming at 16 a stammer that had developed when he was two years old; further notes that the king&rsquo;s therapist, Lionel Logue, was recommended to the royal family by the Scottish publisher, John Murray, after Mr Logue had successfully treated his nephew, and acknowledges the support given by those concerned with the film to the work of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists through highlighting the importance of speech and language services, which, according to independent research, generate &pound;6.43 in increased lifetime earnings for every &pound;1 invested in such therapies.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8059 Des McNulty: Rose Hutcheson, Bankie of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Rose Hutchison, this year&rsquo;s Clydebank Citizen of the Year; acknowledges particularly what is considered to be the tremendous contribution made by Rose as a mental health campaigner participating in countless groups helping people with mental illness and those who support them; praises what it sees as her outstanding role in chairing the group, Mental Health Who Cares, with commitment and passion, and applauds what it views as her tenacity and dedication in raising awareness of the issues facing people with mental illness and their carers.</p>
