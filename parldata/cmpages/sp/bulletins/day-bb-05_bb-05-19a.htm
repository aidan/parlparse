          <p> <strong>9.45 am</strong> Executive Debate: Tackling Serious and Organised Crime - Developing Strategic Partnerships&mdash; </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2824 Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Tackling Serious and Organised Crime - Developing Strategic Partnerships</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that tackling serious organised crime is key to a safer Scotland; recognises that criminal networks operate across local, national and international boundaries; commends the achievements of those responsible in Scotland for bringing to justice those engaged in serious organised crime; supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s actions to achieve speedy and efficient court processes, its efforts to ensure greater co-operation with European and international criminal justice agencies and its plans to strengthen the status of the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency; commends the success of the Crown Office in recovering &pound;5.4 million since the introduction of the Proceeds Of Crime Act 2002, and will continue to support the sustained efforts of all those involved in disrupting and destroying the criminal networks which profit from inflicting violence and misery on communities in Scotland. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-2824.1 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Tackling Serious and Organised Crime Developing Strategic Partnerships</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S2M-2824) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end &ldquo;notes, however, that, whilst co-operation with other bodies both elsewhere in the United Kingdom and abroad is vital, Scotland has a unique legal system and a distinctive policing culture that is community-based and independent from political interference and therefore that the Scottish legal system and Scottish Law Officers must always be responsible for, and in control of, operations in Scotland and the representation of Scottish views and needs abroad.&rdquo; </p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-2824.2 Miss Annabel Goldie: Tackling Serious and Organised Crime Developing Strategic Partnerships</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S2M-2824) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &ldquo;the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;actions which will create an efficient court process; backs the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s efforts to ensure greater co-operation with European and international criminal justice agencies; believes that the status of the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency should be strengthened and therefore hopes that it will not be undermined by the creation of the Serious Organised Crime Agency; commends the success of the Crown Office in recovering &pound;5.4 million since the introduction of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, continues to support the sustained efforts of all those involved in disrupting and destroying the criminal networks which profit from inflicting violence and misery on communities in Scotland, but believes that crime will continue to blight too many Scottish communities until there is an increased police presence on our streets coupled with a zero-tolerant attitude to crime.&rdquo; </p>
