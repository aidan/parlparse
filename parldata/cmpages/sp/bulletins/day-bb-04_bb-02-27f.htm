          <p><strong><a name="971"></a>*S2M-971#</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>World 
            Health Organisation's Bone and Joint Decade 2000 to 2010</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the World Health Organisation's Bone and Joint 
            Decade 2000 to 2010; recognises that musculoskeletal disorders are 
            the most common cause of severe long-term pain and physical disability 
            affecting hundreds of millions of people including many young people 
            around the world; further recognises that joint diseases account for 
            more than half of all chronic conditions in persons aged 60 years 
            and over and that back pain is the second leading cause of sick leave, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider how best 
            to raise awareness of musculoskeletal disorders in Scotland such as 
            rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and ankylosing 
            spondylitis and their impact both on peoples' lives and on the Scottish 
            economy.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-970#</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Association 
            of University Teachers' Industrial Dispute and Strike Action</strong>-That 
            the Parliament supports the campaign by the Association of University 
            Teachers (AUT) for better pay for academic and related staff; notes 
            that the AUT is currently taking strike action, supported by NUS Scotland, 
            and boycotting assessment activity from 1 March 2004 onwards; further 
            notes that since 1980 academic salaries have increased by an average 
            of only 20% compared with a rise in average earnings of 60% and of 
            graduate earnings by still more; believes that fair pay in universities 
            and colleges is essential for recruitment of well-motivated academic 
            staff on whom we rely to create a highly skilled economy in Scotland, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should act on the recommendations 
            in the Enterprise and Culture Committee's <em>Scottish Solutions Inquiry</em> 
            to ensure that investment in higher education in the future will enable 
            staff to be better paid and address problems of recruitment and retention 
            of academic staff.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-969#</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Recognising 
            the Contribution of Scottish Lithuanians</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates the Scottish Lithuanian Cultural and Recreational Social 
            Club in Mossend, Lanarkshire, on the occasion of its 25th anniversary; 
            notes the positive contribution that Lithuanian immigrants have made 
            to Scotland's economy, local communities and special causes; applauds 
            the commitment of members of the club to maintaining a sense of their 
            history; recognises that now, with fifth and sixth generations, the 
            Lithuanian community has integrated successfully but is at risk of 
            losing its cultural identity and language; calls, therefore, for a 
            recognition that, with the accession of Lithuania to the EU, the time 
            is right to welcome further immigrants with much needed skills to 
            Scotland from Lithuania and build on the links already important to, 
            and embedded in, Lanarkshire's culture and history, and hopes that 
            any new immigrants are treated with respect and given a warm welcome 
            in recognition that different communities can and do integrate successfully 
            in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-968</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>The 
            Draft Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>-That the

            2004 be approved.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></P>

            the Communities Committee recommends that the draft Debt Arrangement 
            Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 2004 be approved.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-964</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Maryhill 
            Citizens Advice Bureau's Initiative for Asylum Seekers</strong>-That 
            the Parliament applauds a radical new initiative to integrate asylum 
            seekers into a deprived area of Glasgow by Maryhill Citizens Advice 
            Bureau (CAB); welcomes the news that Maryhill CAB is poised to embark 
            upon an 18-month drive to recruit refugees as volunteer CAB advisers; 
            notes that up to 80% of the refugees the Bureau sees are professionals 
            such as doctors, teachers, accountants and bankers; offers its congratulations 
            to this project, which is backed by the European Social Fund and is 
            the culmination of almost two years work by Citizens Advice Scotland, 
            Maryhill CAB and other Glasgow bureaux; calls upon the Executive to 
            encourage similar projects throughout Scotland, and believes that 
            such attempts to bring the energy and skills of asylum seekers into 
            Scottish life are a welcome change from the authoritarian treatment 
            that asylum seekers receive.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-963</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> 
            <strong>Caithness Glass</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the decision by Royal Worcester and Spode Ltd to call the receivers 
            into the glass-making firm Caithness Glass; recognises the importance 
            of Caithness Glass as an employer, particularly in Perth and Wick; 
            believes that the Caithness Glass name is world-renowned in the manufacture 
            of decorative glass, and hopes that the Scottish Executive and Scottish 
            Enterprise will give all possible assistance to the receivers in their 
            attempts to secure a single buyer for the business as a going concern.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-962</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Highland 
            Peace Movement</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the Lochinvar 
            Declaration for Peace launched on 14 February 2004; commends all those 
            people who have signed up to it and pledged to act for peace; supports 
            the growing movement for peace across Scotland, and notes that this 
            movement will converge on Inverness on 28 February 2004 to urge Tony 
            Blair to do more to find non-violent resolutions to international 
            conflicts.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-961#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Landfill 
            at Greengairs</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the sense of 
            frustration felt by the people of Greengairs following the recent 
            announcement that yet another landfill site is to be opened near to 
            their village; believes that there must be changes made to planning 
            law to ensure that the views of communities are more effectively taken 
            into consideration during the planning process, both at the time of 
            application and following the approval of any applications; welcomes 
            the recent announcement by the First Minister that an environmental 
            justice fund will be established to assist communities such as Greengairs, 
            and believes that representatives from communities such as Greengairs 
            must be involved in the process of designing this fund.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-960</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Scottish Farmed Salmon Industry</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Scottish Quality Salmon for the responsible manner in which it represented 
            this vital Scottish industry during the recent food scare, following 
            the publication of an American research paper that made highly misleading 
            claims about Scottish farmed salmon and calls for all political parties 
            to support publicly this important developing industry against any 
            further dubious or commercially inspired attacks.</P>

            <strong>A Recipe for Disaster</strong>-That the Parliament supports 
            UNISON's campaign to oppose EU plans for the privatisation of meat 
            inspection: shares its concerns for the safety of Scottish meat if 
            these plans go ahead; notes the recent report by the US Department 
            of Agriculture on the failure of the privatised Hazard Analysis Critical 
            Control Points System-based meat inspection system in the USA and 
            the fact that the EU wants to impose the same system on Scotland's 
            meat hygiene industry, and *believes that* the Scottish Executive 
            *should* oppose this privatisation and fight to keep meat inspection 
            in the hands of independent government inspectors.</P>
