            <strong>Dennis Canavan: Adherence to Resolutions of the Parliament</strong>—That 
            the Parliament agrees that it is the national representative body 
            of the Scottish people, with responsibility to make decisions on behalf 
            of the people on devolved matters, and therefore, in keeping with 
            Scotland’s democratic tradition, demands that the Scottish Executive 
            implement all such decisions of the Parliament, including the resolution 
            of Thursday 8 March 2001 resulting from motion S1M-1725 as amended 
            which calls upon the Scottish Executive, among other things, to provide 
            financial support to our fishermen during the twelve week closure 
            period of the cod recovery plan in the form of an immediate compensated 
            tie-up scheme and other suitable measures.</font></p>

            <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Strip Searching of Four Women Arrested at Faslane</strong>—That 
            the Parliament expresses its deep concern that four of the 200 women 
            arrested during the peaceful anti-nuclear weapons protest at Faslane 
            on 12 February 2001 were subjected to strip searches; agrees with 
            the Irish MP John McGuiness that the treatment of these women was 
            &quot;scandalous&quot;; demands a full inquiry into this situation; 
            further expresses its sincere apologies to the four women who were 
            subjected to these searches and resolves to communicate an apology 
            to each of them with a promise of appropriate action in relation to 
            those who ordered these humiliating and degrading strip searches.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Planning Permission for Telecommunications Masts</strong>—That 
            the Parliament is concerned about the number of telecommunications 
            masts being erected across the country; recognises the public concern 
            regarding the possible health implications of these masts and urges 
            the Scottish Executive to give powers to local authorities to enforce 
            planning regulations on all applications for telecommunications masts 
            and to issue new planning guidelines to ensure that no masts are built 
            within 100 metres of the nearest house or public building.</font></p>

            <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Foot and Mouth Disease in Dumfries and Galloway</strong>—That 
            the Parliament recognises the severe problems being faced in parts 
            of Dumfries and Galloway as a result of the current outbreak of foot 
            and mouth disease; notes that the effects are not confined to the 
            farming industry but also affect slaughterhouses, hauliers, food producers, 
            tourism and retailing businesses; notes with concern that workers 
            have already been laid off by several firms and that many more workers 
            may imminently be laid off, and urges the Scottish Executive to work 
            in partnership with other agencies to seek ways of ameliorating the 
            situation as a matter of urgency.</font></p>
