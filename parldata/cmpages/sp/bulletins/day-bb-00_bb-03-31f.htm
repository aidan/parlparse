    and Public Safety</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with alarm an incident, over
    25&#150;26 March, in which a massive landslide at an opencast mining site in New Cumnock
    moved more than half a mile after the collapse of an earth-mound; further notes that in
    the opinion of the mining company responsible, such landslips &quot;happen day and daily
    because of wet weather&quot;; believes that the current national planning policy
    guidelines which stipulate a minimum distance of 500 metres between opencast workings and
    housing settlements is completely unsatisfactory and does not protect the safety of the
    public, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to review this guideline
    immediately and undertake an assessment of all other opencast mineworkings to determine if
    houses or settlements could be in danger from potential landslips.</p>

    <strong>*S1M-726</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Maternity Services in Forth Valley</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that a consultation exercise has been instigated by Forth Valley
    Acute Hospitals (FVAH) NHS Trust over the future of health service provision in the
    region; further notes that the provision of in-patient maternity services is to be removed
    from Stirling Royal Infirmary and centralised in Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary, and
    calls upon the (FVAH) NHS Trust and Forth Valley Health Board to take fully into account
    the views of those living in the most remote parts of rural Stirlingshire and West
    Perthshire who already face a long journey to Stirling for maternity care, and to take
    into consideration the considerable investment already made in these services at Stirling
    Royal Infirmary in comparison with the significant investment that will be required for a
    new central unit at Falkirk. </p>

    <strong>*S1M-725#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: A Woman's Agenda</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes the decision of the Equalities Commission in Northern Ireland and the
    Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to go ahead with their
    launch of <i>A Woman&#146;s Agenda for the Northern Ireland Assembly</i> on 11 March 2000,
    despite the suspension of the Assembly itself; congratulates those involved in displaying
    such huge faith in the peace process; welcomes the role of <i>A Woman&#146;s Agenda</i> in
    highlighting the common experience of women across the UK of inequality, disadvantage and
    under-representation; expresses its support for all those on the island of Ireland who are
    committed to, and are working for, the eradication of inequality in whatever form it
    exists, and believes that the appropriate committee of the Parliament should explore ways
    of establishing and maintaining dialogue between the women of the Northern Ireland
    Assembly and the Scottish Parliament.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
    <strong>*S1M-724#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Jobs and Training in the Construction
    Industry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the increasing opportunities for construction
    work in Pollok, Glasgow and in Scotland as a whole; believes that the construction
    industry, working along with the construction unions and Construction Industry Training
    Board, should provide real training and apprenticeships for young men and women, work to
    improve safety and regulation in the construction industry and ensure, in conjunction with
    the Executive, local authorities, Social Inclusion Partnerships and other agencies, that
    those most excluded in society by poverty and disadvantage are provided with the
    opportunities to benefit from the jobs created by the boom in the construction industry,
    and further believes that the Executive should do everything within its power to support
    these aims.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
    <strong>*S1M-723</strong> <strong>Ben Wallace: NHS Provision of Equipment for Disabled
    People</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the damming report by the Audit Commission in
    England on NHS provision of equipment to disabled people; considers that the adequate
    provision of aids, adaptations and equipment for disabled people is a priority; believes
    that the NHS in Scotland should ensure that services for the disabled are provided in an
    efficient and effective way to ensure that maximum benefit is gained from the available
    resources, and calls upon the Accounts Commission for Scotland to undertake a review of
    NHS and Social Work provision of aids, adaptations and equipment for disabled people to
    determine whether service provision is adequate and cost effective and, if necessary, to
    make recommendations to secure service improvements.</p>

    <strong>*S1M-722</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: &quot;Business in the Chamber&quot;
    Debate</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the &quot;Business in the Chamber&quot;
    debate as a useful contribution to our democracy, with particular regard to the
    deliberations of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee in its review of local
    economic development services, and believes that similar debates, on other issues such as
    education, health and housing, should be held in the Parliament Chamber in the future
    enabling those who are not Members of the Scottish Parliament but who have experience or
    expertise to bring to bear in relation to such subjects to contribute to a full debate.</p>

    <strong>*S1M-721#</strong> <strong>Nick Johnston: Effects of Initial Recommendations of

    of Forth Valley Acute Hospital Trust to concentrate maternity services in Falkirk, and
    believes that proposals for the replacement Forth River crossing should be brought forward
    at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
