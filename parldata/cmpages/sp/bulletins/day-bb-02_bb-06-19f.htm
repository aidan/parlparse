            support within the transport and business community for responsibility 
            for the rail network in Scotland to be devolved, and calls on the

            Initiative (PFI) procurement in schools, <em>Taking the Initiative 
            - Using PFI contracts to renew council schools</em>, and believes that 
            PFI has proved to be a costly experiment, that local authorities and 
            other public bodies should be free to use traditional public procurement 
            and that, where "off balance sheet" solutions are desirable or necessary,

            aid practitioner having recently left practice in Peebles; is concerned 
            that this, combined with the current closure of Peebles Sheriff Court
