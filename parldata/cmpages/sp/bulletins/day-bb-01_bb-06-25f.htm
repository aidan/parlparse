            Bank Arrestments</strong>—That the Parliament notes the content of Citizens 

            Advice Scotland’s recent report <i>Frozen Money – Bank Arrestments</i>; 

            further notes that bank arrestments are the most common form of diligence 

            in Scotland and that bank arrestments can be as harsh and in some 

            cases harsher than poindings and warrant sales; is concerned that, 

            unlike earnings arrestments, a minimum sum of money for the debtor 

            to live on is not protected from a bank arrestment; is further concerned 

            that protected payments such as benefits, redundancy payments and 

            pensions are not exempt from the application of bank arrestments and 

            that many arrestments are enacted without warning; notes with alarm 

            that the overall impact of such bank arrestments is financial hardship, 

            particularly for families with children; fears that the abolition 

            of poindings and warrant sales in December 2002 will increase the 

            use of bank arrestments as a diligence, and believes that the Scottish 

            Executive should address the problems in the law relating to bank 

            arrestment before this date.</font></p>

            number of accident and emergency control rooms from eight to three 

            by closing Ayr, Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Motherwell; regrets 

            the loss of local knowledge to the service; further notes with concern 

            that the non-emergency service will be removed from control rooms 

            throughout Scotland and dispersed to local hospitals, and calls upon 

            the Scottish Executive to note these concerns, to guarantee that any 

            new proposals will be in the best interests of patients and to accept 

            that, until such a guarantee can be given, the best option is to retain

            <i>Frozen Money</i> produced by the Citizen’s Advice Bureaux (CABx) 

            Scotland; accepts the conclusions of that report, particularly regarding 

            the hardship and misery inflicted upon individuals and families on 

            the basis of debts accrued to local authorities; acknowledges the 

            concern expressed by CABx Scotland that the level of such arrestments 

            may rise since the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001 

            was passed; notes that, although the regulation of bank arrestments 

            and benefits is reserved to Westminster, the governance of local authorities, 

            responsible for around 91% of such arrestments, is within the competence 

            of the Scottish Parliament; urges all of Scotland’s local authorities 

            to accept a voluntary code of conduct which will pledge them to (a) 

            keep all of their residents meticulously well-informed in terms of 

            how much they owe for council tax and other charges, (b) ensure that, 

            when residents fall into debt, they will do everything in power to 

            negotiate mutually acceptable terms of repayment and (c) guarantee 

            that they will use sheriffs’ officers and bank arrestments only as 

            an absolute last resort; calls upon the Scottish Executive to enter 

            into negotiations with Scotland’s local authorities in order to agree 

            terms for that code of conduct, and urges Her Majesty's Government 

            to bring forward legislation, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that 

            there is no conflict between the principle of protecting benefits 

            from arrestment and the operation of this protection in practice.</font></p>

            the answer to question S1W-16178 by Jackie Baillie on 14 June 2001 

            stated that there were, for the year 1999-2000, 1,672 very sheltered

            that based on the latest research available the requirement for very 

            sheltered accommodation for older people is 23 dwellings per 1,000 

            of the older population; acknowledges that Age Concern estimates a 

            requirement in the order of 18,055 such dwellings, and therefore believes 

            that the Scottish Executive should immediately commission a report 

            to confirm very sheltered housing requirements and undertake that 

            the report will be published within the next parliamentary year.</font></p>

            and staff redundancies because of continuing decline in the Scottish

            notes that the Trust has warned that unless significant additional

            Works, the last working jute mill in Scotland and the 1999 European 

            Industrial Museum of the Year, and therefore calls upon the Scottish 

            Executive to provide emergency funding to secure the jobs of the 43 

            staff employed by Dundee Heritage Trust across three sites in the 

            city and, in the longer term, to extend central revenue support in 

            partnership with local authority support to avoid a huge loss, not

            Decline in Sports Facilities</strong>—That the Parliament notes that, according 

            to a report by the Strathclyde University Scottish School of Sports 

            Studies, children at one in seven secondary schools no longer have 

            access to a grass playing field and that, despite government promises 

            to promote sport, there is evidence of a serious long-term decline 

            in the facilities available, almost 40% of schools do not have a football 

            pitch and there is real concern also about community facilities which 

            are closing down because of a lack of resources to maintain them; 

            considers that this situation means that the already high obesity 

            rate among young Scots will continue to rise in the future and that 

            the nation’s performance in the world sporting arena will go into 

            irreversible decline, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive 

            to take positive steps to prioritise sport for children and young 

            people and ensure that locally available and appropriate facilities 

            are available.</font></p>
