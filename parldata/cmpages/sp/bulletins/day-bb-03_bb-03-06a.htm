          <p>9:30 am&#9;Debate on the Record of the Scottish Executive&#151; </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3986</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Record 
            of the Scottish Executive</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            that four years of government by Labour and the Liberal Democrats 
            in Scotland have not achieved the better public services and stronger 
            economy that people in both our urban and rural communities were led 
            to expect and believes that Scotland needs an Executive that will 
            undertake a coherent programme of reform designed to boost Scotland's 
            economic performance and improve our public services by reducing the 
            burden of tax and red tape, empowering parents, professionals and 
            local communities and increasing choice and accountability</p>

              from &quot;not achieved&quot; to end and insert &quot;delivered 
              a clear record of achievement which includes, amongst many other 
              accomplishments, a full legislative programme and Executive action 
              in urban and rural areas that has led to record investment in the 
              health service, the abolition of tuition fees, the introduction 
              of free personal care for older people, nursery places for all three- 
              and four-year-olds for those whose parents want them, record numbers 
              of police, an increase in the seizure of class &quot;A&quot; drugs 
              by 173%, freezing business rates, rates relief for small businesses 
              and a substantial programme for long-term investment in transport; 
              notes that Scotland has achieved the lowest level of unemployment 
              for 25 years, and further believes that the next Parliament will 
              have every opportunity to build upon the foundations laid in this 
              first session for a prosperous, confident Scotland.</a></p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3986.1</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Record 
              of the Scottish Executive</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
              (S1M-3986) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; 
              to end and insert &quot;regrets that four years of government by 
              Labour and the Liberal Democrats in Scotland has failed to improve 
              on the disastrous record of 18 years of Conservative rule; notes 
              that since the Labour/Liberal Executive came to power, hospital 
              waiting lists have grown longer, violent crime has risen, one in 
              three children live in poverty and the economy has recorded the 
              lowest level of growth anywhere in the European Union; recognises 
              that a change of government is essential to reverse the decline 
              in public services, and believes that only with the normal powers 
              of an independent Parliament will Scotland be able to release its 
              full potential.&quot;</p>
