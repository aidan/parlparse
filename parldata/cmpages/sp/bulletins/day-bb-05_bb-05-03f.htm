          <p><strong> * S2M-2750 Fergus Ewing:Holyrood Project: Freedom of Information Request&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that the First Minister and Permanent Secretary have received a request, dated 16 February 2005, that certain information and documentation relating to the Holyrood project be made public under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002; notes that the information should have been provided within the statutory period of 20 working days; notes that neither the Permanent Secretary nor the First Minister have complied with that deadline and are therefore in breach of the law to that extent; believes that, if they cannot lead by example, they are failing in their respective duties and that this bad example will then be followed by others subject to the law; calls on them to provide the information without further delay and to apologise for their breach of the law, and calls on the Permanent Secretary to make a personal explanation in respect of why he has permitted this delay to occur and whether there are any sanctions which may be applied to a Permanent Secretary who breaks the law.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2749 Stewart Stevenson:50 Million Copies of the Firefox Browser: A Victory for Open Source Software&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the volunteers working with the Mozilla Foundation on achieving the first 50 million downloads of the free and open source internet browser, Firefox; notes that it is efficient and secure because its workings can be examined by anyone, thus leading to continuous improvement, and believes that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should consider replacing the bloated, slow, middle-aged and frequently insecure commercial product currently installed on its computers with Firefox.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2748 Ross Finnie:The Draft Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2005&mdash;</strong>That the Environment and Rural Development Committee recommends that the draft Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 be approved.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2745 Margaret Jamieson:Careers Scotland Dispute&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament condemns Scottish Enterprise for its attitude to resolving the dispute with employees in Careers Scotland by insisting that mediation be provided by the private sector rather than by the public service, ACAS, therefore incurring additional costs which could be better used to deliver core services, and calls on the Scottish Executive to intervene immediately for the benefit of the people of Scotland.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2744 # Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:Anglo Beef Processing Plant at Bathgate&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament deeply regrets the closure of the Anglo Beef Processing plant at Bathgate; believes that such a closure is detrimental to the interests of the Scottish lamb industry from both an added-value and animal welfare perspective; expresses concern that this adds to the number of recent closures of food and drink processing facilities in Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ascertain the reasons why such detrimental developments are taking place.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2743 # Carolyn Leckie:Nursery Nurses: Still No Justice&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that it is now a year since the end of the long and heroic struggle of the nursery nurses; commends the contribution that they continue to make to our children&rsquo;s future; recognises that they still do not receive appropriate rewards for the job that they do; further notes that nursery nurses and women in general are still discriminated against in terms of pay and that pay for nursery nurses remains fragmented and inconsistent in Scotland; recognises that now, as was the case last year, they still deserve national pay for a job delivered under national guidance; remembers and commends the stand they have taken and the struggle they continue to pursue, and believes that the Scottish Executive should deliver national pay for nursery nurses commensurate with their professional expertise.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2741 # Trish Godman:Merchant Ships, Maritime Skills and Shipyards&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the dramatic increase in the size of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s merchant fleet which now stands 15th in the world&rsquo;s tonnage; notes that these UK-flagged vessels are, in the main, both newer and larger than hitherto; acknowledges that this resurgence in such an important industry is due to the introduction of the tonnage tax; compliments the British Chamber of Shipping and the two principal trade unions, the RMT and NUMAST, for their co-operative efforts in encouraging and increasing employment opportunities for UK seafarers; believes that those Scottish colleges engaged in maritime education and training courses have an important role to play in this respect but deeply regrets the fact that most of the new ships joining this burgeoning fleet are built in shipyards outwith the United Kingdom, and is of the view that, whilst that estimable but small number of British shipowners who build their vessels in British yards are to be complimented, much more should be done by the Scottish Executive and the UK Government to persuade British shipowners to place their orders in shipyards in Scotland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2740 Mr Mark Ruskell:Alleged Breaches of Traffic Law by Ministry of Defence&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament is concerned about allegations that nuclear warhead convoys running between Burghfield and Coulport have contravened traffic laws by travelling on weight-restricted roads and bridges in the Stirling area with 48-tonne nuclear transporters that are several times in excess of legal weight limits and urges swift investigation and appropriate action by Central Scotland Police.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2739 Donald Gorrie:Interdepartmental Working Group on Freedom of Information&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Interdepartmental Working Group on Freedom of Information to hold its meetings in public and urges other Executive and Parliamentary bodies to follow this excellent example.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2738 # Cathy Peattie:International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament supports International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day on 28 April 2005 which commemorates those who have died or suffered accidents or ill-health as a result of work; welcomes West Lothian Council&rsquo;s commitment to lower flags on council buildings on 28 April every year; notes that every year over 1.3 million workers across the world die from accidents and diseases at work, nearly twice the number of deaths caused by war, and that many such deaths are preventable by improved health and safety; calls for this day to be widely observed in Scotland through action to improve safety and provide a healthier working environment, and believes that the Scottish Executive and others should formally recognise International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day as an annual event, when they take stock and advance plans for health and safety improvements in the year to come.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2733 Mrs Nanette Milne:Congratulations to CRANES for NHS Grampian Fibre Optic Technology Boost&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the recent gift from Cancer Research Aberdeen and North East Scotland (CRANES) to NHS Grampian of &pound;120,000 worth of fibre optic technology for training clinical staff; congratulates CRANES and all those involved in the charity for raising the money to buy this equipment; notes that this fibre optic technology, which has been installed at the Clinical Skills Centre at Foresterhill, will revolutionise endoscopic training in north-east Scotland by enabling training to continue without the need to remove vital kit from daily medical use, and wishes CRANES and all other cancer charities well as they continue to raise funds for such vitally-important causes.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2730 Alex Neil:No Confidence in HM Chief Inspector of Prisons&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the request by Alex Neil MSP to attend the media briefing by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons on 26 April 2005 within Kilmarnock Prison, the purpose of which was to provide a briefing on the November 2004 investigation into the prison; notes that Mr Neil&rsquo;s request was refused; condemns this action by the Chief Inspector as being totally undemocratic and treating the Parliament with contempt; considers that the issuing of this report to the media 24 hours before it was provided to MSPs is further evidence of the contemptuous way in which the Chief Inspector is treating the Parliament, and, in light of this along with his failure to deal adequately with the crises in Kilmarnock Prison, now calls on him to consider his position.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2726 # Shiona Baird:Supporting Local Producers&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the launch of the new farmers&rsquo; market at Stonehaven as a welcome addition to the many thriving markets in the north east of Scotland; acknowledges the continuing popularity and growth of farmers&rsquo; markets, &ldquo;box&rdquo; schemes and community-supported agriculture initiatives across the whole of Scotland; recognises that many consumers are becoming increasingly selective about what they eat and are now consciously rejecting mass-produced, remotely-sourced food in favour of fresh seasonal produce that is grown or reared locally; congratulates local farmers and producers for establishing a range of enterprising initiatives to respond to growing consumer demand for such produce in their areas, and considers that shoppers should actively support Stonehaven&rsquo;s initiative and other examples of sustainable local enterprise which benefit the local producer, the local consumer and the local economy. </p>
