<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2272</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Rule 12.3.3A of Standing Orders be suspended for the purpose of allowing the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee to meet in the afternoon of Thursday 26 June 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2271</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Twentieth Anniversary of the Piper Alpha Disaster</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the twentieth anniversary of the Piper Alpha disaster which claimed the lives of 167 offshore workers on 6 July 1988; celebrates the contribution of members of the Piper Alpha Families&rsquo; and Survivors&rsquo; Association, whose tireless campaigning in the aftermath of the disaster helped to raise the standards of offshore safety to the benefit of many thousands of other offshore workers over the last 20 years; believes that the regulation of offshore safety by the Health and Safety Executive, the provision for offshore safety representatives, support for safety initiatives, such as Step Change in the context of the government/oil and gas industry PILOT taskforce, and the recognition of trade unions offshore have supported a more positive safety culture, and looks forward to continuing active engagement in promoting that safety culture by all concerned in the North Sea and other oil provinces around the world.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2270</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Air Weapon Ban</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the motion supported unanimously by East Dunbartonshire Council in its decision to support the Scottish Government&rsquo;s call to ban air weapon ownership, other than for recognised and legitimate occupational and sporting interests; further notes the council&rsquo;s concerns at the ease with which air weapons can be purchased legally throughout Scotland, and commends East Dunbartonshire Council&rsquo;s action of writing to all other councils in Scotland urging them to support the call to ban ownership and use of air weapons.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2269</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Youth Say &quot;Hear Our Voice&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the <em>Hear Our Voice</em> report by NCH Scotland, which publishes the results of its survey among young people of their priorities for public policy in Scotland; notes that the top priority was reducing poverty, the second was tackling homelessness and the third was providing better access to leisure and recreational opportunities; believes that these chime well with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ambition for a fairer, healthier Scotland and represent an encouraging commitment to social justice on the part of Scotland&rsquo;s young people, and calls on all MSPs, government and civil society in Scotland to continue listening to and learning from young people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2268</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Cove Rangers FC SFL Bid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Cove Rangers FC on winning the Highland League last season; notes Cove Rangers&rsquo; excellent work in the community, especially in its youth development programmes; also congratulates it on an ambitious business plan for the future, and wishes it success in its application to join the Scottish Football League.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2267</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Communities Committee recommends that the draft Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Amendment of Specified Authorities) Order 2008 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2266</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that&mdash;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2264</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>North Glasgow Local Integration Network Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with serious concern the decision taken by Glasgow Community Planning Partnership to slash funding for local integration services across North Glasgow for the next three years; believes that these cuts, which see funding fall from &pound;305,796 in 2007-08 to &pound;221,695 this year and reduced further to &pound;95,550 in 2009-10, are swingeing, ill conceived and unnecessary and in a part of the city with the highest asylum-seeking and refugee population in the city; further believes that the partnership, chaired by Labour Councillor Jim Coleman, was wrong not to consult the Local Community Planning Partnership Boards for Maryhill/Kelvin and Canal, and Springburn and North East Glasgow on the impact of the loss of such funding, and shares the concern of local councillors Grant Thoms and Phil Greene that those projects that were funded by the local integration network are now at serious risk, that north Glasgow&rsquo;s diverse local communities may suffer as a result, and that the Partnership should reconsider this decision as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2248</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Aircraft Carrier Delay Could Cost Jobs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern over the delay in signing the contract for two new aircraft carriers, which could lead to the loss of jobs at the Clyde shipyards in Glasgow; condemns the reported comments made by Glasgow MPs Mohammad Sarwar and Ian Davidson that if Scotland were to become an independent state it would risk losing up to 50,000 jobs in the defence sector; believes that, by putting political self-interest ahead of the vital Scottish shipbuilding industry and engaging in needless scaremongering, these comments will only serve to cause uncertainty and worry for many workers and their families, and calls on all Scottish MPs to work constructively to safeguard the future of the shipbuilding industry in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2248.1</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Aircraft Carrier Delay Could Cost Jobs</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2248) in the name of Sandra White, leave out from &quot;concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;continued support for the announcement of the joint venture to construct two new aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, and calls on the Ministry of Defence to move quickly to formally sign the contracts confirming the construction arrangements for the carriers which will provide certainty for workers at the Scotstoun and Govan Shipyards on the Clyde and Rosyth Dockyard as well as at Portsmouth and Barrow; notes that a recent report published by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee of the House Commons warned that the sustainability of up to 50,000 highly-skilled jobs in the Scottish defence industry which are reliant on UK Government contracts would be put under threat by constitutional change and welcomes the robust defence of the sector by Glasgow&rsquo;s local MPs and MSPs, and further notes that the survival and significant revival of the heavy shipbuilding industry on the River Clyde has been made possible only as a result of the UK Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to Scottish defence industry jobs since 1997.&quot;</p>
