          <p><strong>*S1M-2538</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: &#145;Our National 
            Health&#146; - Delivering Change</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the progress made by the Executive and the contribution of 
            NHS staff towards delivering the commitments in <i>Our National Health: 
            A Plan for Action, a Plan for Change</i> published in December 2000 
            but recognises the long-term nature of the Plan and reaffirms its 
            commitment to the various longer-term goals, including major reductions 
            in waiting times and significant public health improvements.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong>, Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2537</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Civil Legal 
            Aid</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the Cross-Party Group 
            on Men&#146;s Violence Against Women and Children in its campaign 
            to make it easier for abused women to access civil legal aid; calls 
            on the Executive to implement the recommendations of the Justice 1 
            Committee that the eligibility criteria for civil legal aid be widened 
            by removing the inconsistencies in the treatment of benefits and by 
            increasing the lower capital limit; urges the Executive to increase 
            as a matter of urgency the current qualifying income levels which 
            ultimately determine whether or not an application can be considered 
            eligible to receive legal aid; and further urges the Executive to 
            review the scale of contributions payable by applicants to minimise 
            their financial burden in order to recognise that many women who leave 
            their abuser have additional demands on their income which further 
            disadvantage them.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2536</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe: European Notes 
            and Coins</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that the introduction 
            of the new notes and coins for the single European currency on 1 January 
            2002 will begin the phasing out of the existing currencies of the 
            eurozone; further notes that a recent survey found that the average 
            British household presently has £35 worth of EU coins squirreled away, 
            which suggests that up to £80 million&#146;s worth of left-over holiday 
            money, which will become worthless after the changeover, may be presently 
            lying about in Scotland, and urges all Scots to take advantage of 
            the schemes run by banks to facilitate the donation of these monies 
            to charities in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Farquhar Munro<strong>*</strong>, Dennis Canavan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2535</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Condemnation 
            of Female Circumcision</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">expresses 
            concern about violence against women and children especially in the 
            form of female genital mutilation (FGM); commends the research on 
            FGM being carried out by the International Centre for Reproductive 
            Health; declares FGM to be a violation of the human rights of girls 
            and women as it represents an attempt to control women&#146;s sexuality 
            and subordinate their status in society; notes the existing legislation 
            on this subject, and supports the continued promotion of women&#146;s 
            rights in an effort to stop FGM.</a></p>
