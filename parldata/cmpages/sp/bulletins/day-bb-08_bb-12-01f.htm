<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2992</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Voluntary and Public Sector Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the inaugural Herald Society Awards, presented in conjunction with the Big Lottery Fund; congratulates all the winners of the 2008 awards; acknowledges that these awards recognise inspirational work and achievement in a wide range of categories by individuals and teams from the public and voluntary sectors, and believes that it is appropriate that success stories are celebrated and shared.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2991&diams; </strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Communities Leading on Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the community groups around Scotland, such as the Toryglen Gardening Club in Glasgow, that have made successful applications to the Climate Challenge Fund; notes that the fund makes available &pound;27.4 million over three years to support community-led efforts to make serious carbon reductions across Scotland; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s diverse communities can play an important role in carbon innovation, and believes that projects supported by the fund can also help build community cohesion, tackle social exclusion and build sustainable local economies.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2989</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Size Does Matter</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the EIS report<em>, The Case for Reducing Class Sizes in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools, </em>supporting the case for a reduction in class sizes; notes that studies have shown that smaller class sizes result in higher attainment levels, particularly among those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and an improvement in pupil behaviour, motivation and self-image, and urges all parties involved in the delivery of smaller class sizes to work together to give all children in Scotland the opportunity to realise their full potential.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2988</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson on behalf of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee:</strong> <strong>Audit Committee - Title and Remit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&rsquo;s 8th Report, 2008 (Session 3), <em>Audit Committee - Title and Remit </em>(SP Paper 151), and agrees that the changes to Standing Orders set out in Annexe A to the report be made with effect from 11 December 2008.</p>
<p>Supported by: Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2987</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson on behalf of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee:</strong> <strong>Elections to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&rsquo;s 1st Report, 2008 (Session 3), <em>Elections to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body </em>(SP Paper 47), and agrees that the changes to Standing Orders set out in Annexe A to the report be made with effect from 11 December 2008.</p>
<p>Supported by: Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2986</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Bull Hire Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the enormous benefits brought to cattle quality and cattle health throughout the Highlands and Islands as a result of the Bull Hire Scheme operated by the Crofters Commission over many years; welcomes the potential for improved markets and prices obtained from good-quality, health-certified stock; notes the practical arrangements that the scheme offers to allow good over-wintering provisions and health checks for the bulls, which might otherwise be beyond the reach of many crofters; regards the scheme as a sensible and practical way that government can support small-scale and remotely-located crofting enterprise; notes the widespread concern of cattle-breeding crofters about the proposal to end the scheme, and urges the Scottish Government to reconsider its decision to end the Bull Hire Scheme and commit to retaining a scheme as a sound and practical way of supporting crofters and quality cattle production in some of our most remote Highlands and Islands areas.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2954</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Steven Taylor, Professional of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Steven Taylor, an employee of Capita Life and Pensions, Glasgow, who was awarded the prestigious United Kingdom-wide titles of Professional of the Year - Agent and Overall Professional of the Year at the 2008 Customer Contact Association awards in Edinburgh; believes that such awards demonstrate Steven&rsquo;s hard work, commitment, ability and professionalism, and further believes that such an accolade going to an employee of a Scottish-based firm sends out a strong signal as to the quality, skill and dedication of a Scottish-based workforce, which is vital not only in terms of maintaining Scottish jobs but also in expanding Scotland&rsquo;s jobs base.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1975#</strong> <strong>Gavin Brown:</strong> <strong>South Edinburgh Suburban Railway</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the wide public and cross-party political support that the campaign for the reopening of the South Sub railway has gathered; acknowledges the importance of the work carried out by groups such as Capital Rail Action Group (CRAG), E-Rail and TRANSform Scotland; observes that the most recent report on the reopening of the South Sub did not contain a benefit-cost ratio, which was positive in previous reports; believes that the reopening of the South Sub would ease the impact of traffic on the main routes into the city as well as playing an important role in the reduction of fuel emissions in the south of Edinburgh, and believes that there is a case for the reopening of passenger services on the South Edinburgh Suburban Railway.</p>
