<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4465</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Trade Union Freedom Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that free and independent trade unions are a force for good in UK society and around the world and are vital to democracy; welcomes the positive role which modern unions play in providing protection for working people and winning fairness at work; notes that the 1906 Trades Disputes Act granted unions the legal freedom to take industrial action; regrets that successive anti-union legislation has meant that trade union rights are now weaker than those introduced by the Trades Disputes Act; notes the overwhelming support at both the Trades Union Congress and Labour Party Conference for the Gate Gourmet workers and for improvements in union rights, including measures to simplify ballot procedures and to allow limited supportive action, following a ballot, in specificcircumstances; further notes that these conferences called for legislation which conforms to International Labour Organisation conventions ratified by the United Kingdom, and therefore welcomes the decision of the 2005 Trades UnionCongress to campaign for a trade union freedom Bill to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1906 Trades Disputes Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4464</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that creating a greater degree of school autonomy, devolving more powers to head teachers and giving greater say to parents and teachers in shaping the education system will raise standards; is therefore disappointed at the abolition of school boards which will dilute parental representation in schools; notes that Jordanhill School, Scotland&rsquo;s only remaining independently run but publicly funded school, has consistently been among the top-performing schools in Scotland and won the SQA &quot;School of the Year&quot; award; notes that teaching unions are voicing concerns over the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s discipline and mainstreaming policies, and calls on the Executive to introduce reforms to create a more diverse education system in Scotland to raise standards, tackle discipline and serve the needs and aspirations of all pupils.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4463</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Football Clubs and Community Involvement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the good work done in their communities by leading football clubs in using their names to attract fans to take part in courses to educate young people about the dangers of drugs and alcohol, to develop a more positive attitude to school among pupils who are currently disaffected, to encourage and equip long-term unemployed people to start employment, to reduce sectarian and racist prejudices and to motivate many young people through football coaching to be more active and positive; believes that these good projects should be vigorously developed across the whole country by drawing on the enthusiasm and loyalty that football clubs arouse to motivate many more people to take part in these schemes, and further believes that the clubs, voluntary organisations, local authorities and the Scottish Executive should co-operate to provide and promote these benefits to individuals and to the community, bringing together the skills and energies of all those involved and the attraction of the club&rsquo;s name, and that the Executive should carefully target more financial resources directly to these projects.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4462</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Impact of Water Rates on Charities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the impact of the liability to pay full water rates incurred by charities which did not occupy their premises prior to 1999; notes that many charities simply cannot afford this size of bill, and believes that the Scottish Executive should examine ways of assisting charities facing this kind of difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4461</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Community Councils</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that community councils play a vital role in Scotland&rsquo;s democracy and should receive adequate funding and professional support to enable them to fulfil their role.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4460</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Greentrax</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Greentrax Recordings, &quot;Scotland&rsquo;s Favourite Record Company&quot;, on its 20th anniversary; welcomes the recognition of founder, Ian Green, by the academic board of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in its award to him of the honorary degree of Doctor of Music; thanks Ian Green and all at Greentrax Recordings for their work in the preservation and promotion of Scottish traditional music and contribution to our nation&rsquo;s culture, and looks forward to many more years of great music.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4459</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Proposal for New Incinerators</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the six strategic outline cases (SOCs), plans for municipal waste, that have been submitted by Strategic Operation Review Groups (SORGs) of local authorities for approval by the Scottish Executive to proceed to outline business case; notes the two outline business cases currently under development; notes with concern that all but one group of local authorities propose the incineration of waste and that the scale of incineration proposals, totalling two million tonnes, is far greater than that proposed in Scotland&rsquo;s 2003 National Waste Plan; notes that an extensive and inclusive process was undertaken to establish 11 area waste plans each containing a best practicable environmental option for dealing with waste; is aware that incineration risks encouraging the generation of waste because incinerators require to process certain volumes of waste in order to remain viable; is aware that incineration results in loss of potentially useful materials at the same time as encouraging further resource depletion through use of virgin raw materials;  is aware that incineration can cause pollution, including from dioxins, affecting neighbouring communities; is aware that energy from mixed waste should not be regarded as a renewable energy source as it relies on a non-renewable fuel source; understands that incineration reduces the potential for creating jobs in recycling and waste minimisation; believes that any sustainable approach to waste management must acknowledge the top-down &quot;reduce &ndash; reuse &ndash; recycle&quot; hierarchy and that waste minimisation and recycling are the more environmentally and socially sustainable ways of dealing with waste; recognises that many of the SOCs proposed include recycling and waste production rates which contradict commitments made in the 2003 National Waste Plan to stabilise waste generation by 2010 and recycle 55% of waste by 2020, and therefore urges Scottish Ministers to request that those SORGs which contradict the National Waste Plan&rsquo;s best practicable environmental option review their SOCs to make them compatible with it.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4458</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Science Base, a Cause for Concern</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern, following the closure of the world-renowned Hannah Research Institute, that further decisions of a similar nature may be taken that will damage Scotland&rsquo;s science base and that failure to exercise due responsibility of care for the nation&rsquo;s core scientific capability will impact adversely on future economic prosperity in addition to undermining the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s ability to make scientifically informed decisions.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4457</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>School Environment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the environment in which many of our children, young people and teachers learn and teach is not always conducive to ensuring the best learning conditions; accepts that poor school environments are a direct result of following a policy of building schools under PPP initiatives and under-investment in the fabric of existing schools, instead of investing in properly built and maintained schools financed under the public sector; notes that students and teachers deserve the best conditions possible in which to learn and teach, including buildings in which facilities exist to monitor and control temperatures, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to initiate an immediate review of school building conditions and the installation of temperature monitoring and control systems.</p>
