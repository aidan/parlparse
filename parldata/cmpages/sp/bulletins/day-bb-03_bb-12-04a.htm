          <p><strong>S2M-697</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Financial 
            Powers of the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that, 
            in order to be properly accountable to the electorate, it should be 
            responsible for raising its revenue as well as spending public money 
            and agrees that making every country follow the same tax rules diminishes 
            competitiveness by killing jobs and stifling growth. </P>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
              <p><strong>S2M-697.3</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Financial Powers 
                of the Parliament</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-697) 
                in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from second &quot;that&quot; 
                to end and insert, &quot;the significant benefit that Scotland 
                gains from being part of the United Kingdom and notes that public 
                expenditure in Scotland is at record levels and that this is helping 
                to deliver the commitments in the Partnership Agreement to &quot;growing 
                Scotland's economy; delivering excellent public services, supporting 
                stronger, safer communities and developing a confident, democratic 
                Scotland.&quot; </P>
              <p> <strong>S2M-697.2</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Financial 
                Powers of the Parliament</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-697) 
                in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; 
                to end and insert &quot;notes that it will only regain the confidence 
                of the people of Scotland if it addresses the issues of most concern 
                to them and that we must therefore concentrate on improving our 
                public services, strengthening our economy and tackling crime; 
                recognises nevertheless that the relative responsibilities of 
                the Parliament and Westminster, including the financial relationship, 
                should be the subject of review in light of experience; calls 
                for such a review to be conducted within the context of making 
                the devolved settlement work better and thereby strengthening 
                the United Kingdom, and believes that the most appropriate mechanism 
                for such a review would be a Royal Commission or similar independent 
                inquiry appointed by the UK government.&quot; </P>
              <p> <strong>S2M-697.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Financial 
                Powers of the Parliament</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-697) 
                in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;making&quot; 
                to end and insert &quot;acquiring additional powers to tax as 
                well as spend would allow the Parliament to make the Scottish 
                taxation structure much more progressive, begin the process of 
                tackling the inequalities of wealth in Scotland and ending poverty; 
                recognises, however, that fiscal autonomy alone would not overcome 
                the serious distortions of the Scottish economy caused by our 
                being part of the United Kingdom and will not allow the Parliament 
                to stop the profligate expenditure of the UK government on immoral 
                and illegal wars against the wishes of its people, nor the ongoing 
                expenditure on weapons of mass destruction as typified by nuclear 
                weapons at Faslane, and that it would still have insufficient 
                fiscal powers to broaden its tax base and invigorate its economy 
                and culture by adopting a policy of welcoming to Scotland the 
                asylum seekers and other immigrants whom it requires, and further 
                agrees that only an independent Scotland will give the Parliament 
                the powers to tackle these economic and social issues.&quot; </P>

                in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; 
                to end and insert &quot;notes the continuing improvement in bathing 
                water quality in Scotland but believes that further progress is 
                now dependent on addressing the limitations of Scottish Water 
                and the planning system.&quot;</P>
              <p><strong>S2M-695.4</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell: Protecting 
                Bathing Water Quality</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-695) 
                in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; 
                to end and insert &quot;notes that while 2003 represents a record 
                year for compliance with the Bathing Water Directive, some of 
                Scotland's best bathing locations still fail to meet minimum standards; 
                notes that compliance with the higher standards required by a 
                revised European Directive will place further demands upon Scottish 
                Water, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and other bodies 
                with responsibilities for water quality; further notes that other 
                legislation also impacts on Scotland's bathing water quality, 
                and urges the Scottish Executive to be mindful of these considerations 
                and of the importance of integrated coastal zone management when 
                it consults on the best strategy for protecting and enhancing 
                Scotland's coastline.&quot;</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-578</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Unity 
            Enterprise Glasgow Airport</strong>-That the Parliament commends Unity 
            Enterprise, a registered charity, which provides education, training, 
            work experience and other assistance to young people and adults who 
            have disabilities and disadvantages of one kind or another; notes 
            in particular the helpful and practical assistance given by a group 
            of such young people and adults to passengers at Glasgow Airport, 
            especially the help shown to those individuals who have to use wheelchairs, 
            in relation to shopping requirements, visits to cafes and toilets 
            and the company offered to passengers in allocated areas; believes 
            that this is both a comfort to travellers and offers a useful introduction 
            to the workplace for those who are themselves disadvantaged, and therefore 
            considers that the Scottish Executive and other appropriate agencies 
            should do what they can in order to extend similar services to other 
            airports, bus terminals and railway stations. </P>
