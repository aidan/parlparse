          <p><strong>S2M-1235</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Space 
            Invaders</strong>-That the Parliament notes the difficulties experienced 
            by people within local communities who have secured disabled parking 
            spaces outside their homes; deplores the fact that these spaces can 
            become a focus of conflict within communities where people seek to 
            use such a space, despite not having a disabled parking badge; notes 
            with equal dismay the figures published by the Baywatch campaign group 
            that show that over 20% of disabled parking bays in supermarket car 
            parks are being used by non-disabled drivers; recognises that the 
            current legal position, which distinguishes between courtesy parking 
            spaces and those supported by traffic regulation orders, creates problems 
            for people with disabilities who need to rely on a designated parking 
            space outside their home; appreciates, in the case of car parks on 
            private land such as those belonging to supermarkets, the frustration 
            of disabled drivers where the store management appears reluctant to 
            enforce its own parking policy; acknowledges that, for their part, 
            some store managers are not clear about their powers to compel drivers 
            to move from specially designated bays; notes that this situation 
            leaves supermarkets vulnerable to future legal action under the Disability 
            Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended); therefore believes that the 
            Scottish Executive, local authorities and all relevant agencies should 
            work together to develop an awareness campaign to highlight the rights 
            of disabled people and to emphasise the unacceptability of harassing 
            those who have been allocated disabled parking spaces, and considers 
            that, if a satisfactory solution cannot be found, the possibility 
            of legislating to address the problem and giving local authorities 
            the appropriate enforcement powers should be examined.</P>
