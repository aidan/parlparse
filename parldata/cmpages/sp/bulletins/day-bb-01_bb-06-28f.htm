            Nurses&quot; campaign, which highlights the crucial role that nurses 

            play in delivering high quality patient care; welcomes the nursing 

            summit announced by the Minister for Health and Community Care, and 

            believes that the Executive should take action to recruit and retain 

            more nurses and to reward them in a way which demonstrates the value

            Parliament warmly congratulates the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service 

            (WRVS) on its outstanding commitment and contribution to public service 

            in Scotland, estimated conservatively at £12 million in free working 

            hours alone, but which is immeasurable in terms of loving kindness; 

            expresses Scotland’s pride in, and gratitude for, the WRVS’s work 

            in all manner of fields for the past 63 years, from service in hospitals, 

            homes, prisons and lunch clubs to work in toy libraries, child contact 

            centres, courts and at emergency scenes, and notes that a fine example 

            of the faithfulness of those in the voluntary service is shown by 

            the volunteers at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow, 

            where Alice McPherson, Sarah Cullen, Olive Colraine and Helen Burrow 

            have just received awards ranging from a 15-year service certificate 

            to 15-year service medals for their dedication to the remarkable WRVS 

            hospital shop, where child patients and parents receive not only service 

            but cheer and kindness.</font></p>

            of a special accommodation allowance to the Minister for Parliament, 

            Mr Tom McCabe MSP; believes that this is unnecessary given that he 

            has access to a ministerial car; also believes that this allowance 

            sends the wrong signals to the electorate, and considers that either 

            the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should withdraw this allowance 

            or the Minister for Parliament should decline it.</a></font></p>
