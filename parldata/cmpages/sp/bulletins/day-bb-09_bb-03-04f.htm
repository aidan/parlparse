<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3609</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government Failures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that SNP manifesto promises have been broken on a wide range of issues including health, housing, community safety and education; further notes the absence of a credible strategy to address the needs of people facing difficult economic circumstances and to tackle poverty and disadvantage; regrets that the Scottish Government prefers to focus its attention on the powers it does not have in order to pursue its party&rsquo;s agenda of separation, and urges the Scottish Government to examine how it might effectively use the powers at its disposal to meet the needs of people by sustaining economic activity and employment and supporting communities across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3608</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Ayrshire Macmillan Ayrshire Appeal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Macmillan Cancer Support on the official launch of the Ayrshire Macmillan Money Matters Service on 3 March 2009; notes that even before the official launch, since opening in November 2008, 164 people with cancer and their families in Ayrshire have secured over &pound;183,000 in additional benefits; recognises that Macmillan now runs 26 such centres across Scotland and, to date, has generated some &pound;30 million in additional benefits, successfully assisting some 76% of all those who have called on their services; acknowledges that Macmillan also awards small hardship grants totalling around &pound;1.5 million a year in Scotland for some 4,000 people; is aware that Ayrshire Money Matters was established with the support of East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire councils, NHS Ayrshire and Arran and the Pensions Service, with &pound;300,000 from Macmillan itself to fund full-time welfare rights workers in each local authority area; commends the excellent work that Macmillan does in providing information on all aspects of finance, and wishes Macmillan Cancer Support every success in raising &pound;500,000 through its Ayrshire Appeal to support the Ayrshire Macmillan Money Matters Service for the next three years and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3607</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>60th Anniversary of NATO</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 4 April 2009 marks the 60th anniversary of the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO); recognises that the continued presence of NATO serves as a destabilising factor in the West&rsquo;s relationship with Russia; notes that NATO relies heavily on the continued use of nuclear weapons as part of its operational capacity; recalls that the first Secretary General of NATO, Lord Ismay, described the organisation&rsquo;s purpose as being &quot;to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down&quot;; further recognises that the world has fundamentally changed since the founding of NATO in 1949, and, given that the Cold War is meant to be over, believes that the organisation has no useful purpose in the modern world.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3606</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Cruelty of Snaring Exposed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that authenticated footage, filmed on Tuesday 24 February 2009 and published by Advocates for Animals, showing a young badger caught in a legal snare has demonstrated that these traps are cruel, distressing and indiscriminate; notes that disturbance of the surrounding area and the fact that the badger had almost chewed through the steel cable of the snare, injuring its mouth in the process, indicated that it had been struggling desperately for many hours before its discovery; believes that had this badger, a protected species, not been found, it might have died a lingering and agonising death; believes that this incident is not isolated but is proof that regulating snares will not work, and therefore urges the Scottish Government to legislate to ban snares without delay.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3605</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Citizens of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Barbara Barnes and Elizabeth Hartley on winning the Vale and Dumbarton citizens of the year respectively; applauds Barbara Barnes for her work with various groups within the area, including Macmillan Cancer Support and Alzheimer Scotland&rsquo;s Carers Group among others; notes the contribution that she has made to charity, taking part in many fund-raising events such as parachute jumps, zip slides and fire walking; praises Elizabeth Hartley on running a companion club for pensioners and her personal care for an elderly friend, despite her own ill-health, and welcomes the deserved recognition bestowed on these two model citizens by the local community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3604</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Time to Abandon GB Football Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments of FIFA President Sepp Blatter that the independence of separate Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish and English football teams will be jeopardised if the UK Government persists with a Great Britain football team for the 2012 London Olympics; further notes that the 1908 London Olympics provide a precedent for all four home nations to be allowed to participate in their own right; considers that it is time to stop any pretence that a GB team will not have an effect on the status of the four associations and to take heed of the comments of the President of FIFA, who stated on 9 March 2008, &quot;if you start to put together a combined team for the Olympic Games, the question will automatically come up that there are four different associations so how can they play in one team&quot;, and calls for the UK Government to start listening to the Scottish Football Association, FIFA and the Tartan Army on this matter.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3603&diams; </strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Survey of Scottish Manufactured Exports 2007/08</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI) of its <em>Survey of Scottish Manufactured Exports 2007/08</em>; notes with concern the finding reported in the survey that Scotland&rsquo;s manufacturing exports continue to lag behind their peak of almost &pound;20 billion in 1999; welcomes the signs of increased diversity of exports, with a rise of over 8% in non-electronics exports in 2007 and with food products and beverages performing particularly strongly at a 12% increase compared with a decline in total exports of 2.4%; notes that the current economic downturn is having an adverse impact on companies engaged in manufacturing, including Vesuvius, Mahle, and Diageo, which all operate in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency; commends the SCDI for its commitment to assisting Scottish manufacturing, including its support for the recently launched BusinessClub Scotland, and welcomes the First Minister&rsquo;s undertaking to have the Council of Economic Advisers examine how best Scotland&rsquo;s manufacturing companies can be supported through and beyond the current recession.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3602</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Designation of Lead Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Health and Sport Committee be designated as the lead committee in consideration of the Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3559*#*</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Future of the Sunday Mail and Daily Record</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of Trinity Mirror to merge the editorial content of the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail</em> with the loss of up to 30% of journalistic staff, based primarily in Glasgow and the West of Scotland; recognises that both newspapers are an integral part of Scottish culture and that to diminish their individual identities would be a serious blow to the diversity, vibrancy and quality of the Scottish media; believes that the loss of their separate identities would undoubtedly lead to the erosion of circulation at both titles, leading inevitably to further job losses; considers that Trinity Mirror is highly profitable and that there is no need to undertake such drastic restructuring, and therefore very much hopes that good sense may prevail over the future of two of Scotland&rsquo;s leading titles.</p>
