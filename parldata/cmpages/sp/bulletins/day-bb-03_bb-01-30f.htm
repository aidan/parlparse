          <p><strong>*S1M-3829</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Centenary of 
            James McNeill Whistler (1834 - 1903)</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            commends the hard work and efforts of all of the people associated 
            with the events taking place at The Hunterian Art Gallery, University 
            of Glasgow, to mark the centenary of the death of James McNeill Whistler 
            (1834-1903); notes that, while Whistler only visited Scotland once, 
            he had strong links with the country through his family and the influence 
            of his work, most notably on the Glasgow Boys; further notes that 
            one of the world's most important collections of Whistler's work is 
            held at the Hunterian Art Gallery and was presented to the University 
            of Glasgow by Whistler's heir, Rosalind Birnie Philip, in recognition 
            of his Scottish links and the conferral of an honorary degree on him 
            in 1903; applauds the sterling efforts of all concerned in securing 
            the return to Glasgow on loan from the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, for the 
            first time in half a century, of Whistler's most famous work, <em>Arrangement 
            in Grey and Black No. 1: Portrait of the Painter's Mother</em> (1871), 
            and in explaining the significance of the painting for Whistler, its 
            acquisition by the Mus&eacute;e du Luxembourg in 1891 and its continuing 
            life as an icon and inspiration for satirists, cartoonists, copyists 
            and others; commends the work of the Centre for Whistler Studies at 
            the University of Glasgow in preparing an edition of the 10,000 letters 
            in the Whistler correspondence, highlighting his contacts with artists, 
            critics, dealers, models, patrons, publishers and many more and demonstrating 
            that he was known as much for his sharp wit as for his art during 
            the half-century from 1855 to 1903, and is encouraged by the support 
            lent by LloydsTSB Scotland for a range of Whistler 2003 exhibitions 
            and events as part of a Glasgow-wide festival running throughout the 
            year.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3828</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Cockenzie 
            House</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the threatened 
            and imminent closure of Cockenzie House in Cockenzie, a private nursing 
            home currently with 56 residents aged from 50 to 90, due to persistent 
            under-funding by the local authority; further notes that by 31 March 
            2003 it is probable that those 56 frail people will lose what is now 
            their home and that this is yet another example of the loss of local 
            provision for the frail and elderly, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to take immediate steps nationwide to provide urgent funding in the 
            interests of those who are our most vulnerable citizens.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3827#</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Towns Review</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the invaluable contribution that Scotland&#146;s 
            towns make to national life and the fabric of society, notes with 
            concern the current lack of plans to carry out a towns review and 
            provide funds on a similar basis as for cities, and believes that 
            a review should be carried out, as a matter of urgency, to promote 
            and restore vitality in Scotland&#146;s towns which would result in 
            job creation, enhanced service provision, improved infrastructure 
            and a boost to civic pride.</p>

            Support Appeals (Jurisdiction of Courts) (Scotland) Order 2003</strong>&#151;That 
            the Justice 2 Committee, in consideration of the draft Child Support 
            Appeals (Jurisdiction of Courts) (Scotland) Order 2003, recommends 
            that the Order be approved.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3824#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Scottish Police 
            Memorial Trust</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the formation 
            of the Scottish Police Memorial Trust by James McNulty, retired police 
            officer, and Christine Fulton, widow of Constable Lewis Fulton of 
            Strathclyde Police who was the last officer to be murdered on duty 
            in Scotland in June 1994; notes that the purpose of the trust is to 
            identify a suitable location and build and maintain a national memorial 
            to all Scottish police officers who have lost their lives in the line 
            of duty, and considers that the Scottish Executive should support 
            this initiative. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3823</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Scottish Fire 
            Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">deplores 
            the action taken by Her Majesty's Government to introduce legislation 
            to take new powers of direction over the fire service; is mindful 
            that under the Scotland Act 1998 the Scottish Parliament has legislative 
            competence for all fire service matters in Scotland, and urges the 
            Scottish Executive to develop a distinctive Scottish Fire Service 
            as outlined in the consultation paper <em>The Scottish Fire Service 
            of the Future</em> and to make it clear to Her Majesty's Government 
            that any legislation for the Scottish Fire Service will be subject 
            to proper consultation and scrutiny by the committees of the Parliament.</a></p>
