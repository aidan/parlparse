  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2057.3</strong> <strong>Andy Kerr: Investment in Scottish Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2057) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;notes the comments of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth acknowledging that his priority is to get best value and the best deal for taxpayers whether that investment comes from private or public sources and welcomes the statement on page 7 of the strategic business case which provides for guidance, structuring and compliance for ongoing non-profit distribution (NPD)/PPP programmes, firmly placing PPP at the heart of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategy, and believes that in the interests of Scotland and its people it is now time to end the confusion surrounding the SFT, admit that it is based on the same principles as those proven financial models which have delivered new schools and hospitals and that it is time to restart the building of schools, hospitals and the transport infrastructure.&quot; </p>

    <p> <strong>S3M-2057.2</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur: Investment in Scottish Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2057) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;but notes that the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth promised the Parliament that a decision on the method of financing for the new Forth crossing would be made in Autumn 2007; is concerned that eight months later no decision has been taken; further notes that the First Minister&rsquo;s preferred method of issuing &quot;patriotic bonds&quot; has been dismissed as illegal and the non-profit distribution model is considered inappropriate for high risk projects, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to make a statement to the Parliament setting out method of funding, management arrangements and timetable for procurement of the new Forth crossing before the summer recess.&quot; </p>

  <p><strong>S3M-1960</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Holocaust Education in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament accepts the crucial importance of ensuring that the genocide of the Jewish and other peoples and minority groups inflicted during the Holocaust is never allowed to slip from public consciousness; welcomes the commitment of successive Scottish governments to developing a permanent National Holocaust Museum based in East Renfrewshire and looks forward to the fulfilment of that commitment; applauds the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust, among other organisations, for the role it plays in educating young people from every background about the Holocaust and the important lessons that can still be learned from it today, and considers that sufficient resources should be made available to allow schools across the west of Scotland and beyond to provide ongoing Holocaust education, with visits to the Auschwitz concentration camp being considered as part of that educational mix. </p>
