<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4080</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Declining Bee Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern reports of the continuing decline in bee numbers and in the number of other key pollinators; notes the importance of bees for the production of honey and, along with other species, their vital importance in food production and in support of biodiversity; supports measures to research and understand better what may be causing the reported declines as a basis for appropriate further actions; further notes that in some areas, such as Colonsay, the varroa mite, which is known to be responsible for some of the decline in bee numbers, is not present, and considers that the Scottish Government should make every effort to maintain that position and sustain bee and other key pollination numbers.</p>
<p>Supported by: Rhoda Grant<strong>*</strong>, David Stewart<strong>*</strong>, John Scott<strong>*</strong>, Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Mitchell<strong>*</strong>, Karen Gillon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4079</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>JEREMIE Support Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement of the Welsh Assembly Government on 24 April 2009 of a new &pound;150 million fund through Finance Wales that will support the expansion of more than 800 businesses and create up to 15,000 jobs across Wales, using &pound;75 million funding from the European Investment Bank under the European Union&rsquo;s Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) initiative and a further &pound;60 million from the Welsh Assembly Government via European Regional Development Fund resources; recognises that the funding, the first JEREMIE fund to be launched in the United Kingdom, will enable Finance Wales plc, a commercial funding provider to small and medium-sized businesses in Wales owned by the Welsh Assembly Government, to make debt and equity investments in growing businesses throughout Wales; further notes that the recently announced Scottish Investment Bank combines existing equity finance support in Scotland to high growth businesses but regrets that it does not provide debt lending and support for small businesses, and further regrets that the Scottish Government has so far not acted on requests made by the Liberal Democrats in October 2008 for a JEREMIE support fund to be delivered in Scotland to help businesses secure debt lending during the recession and that, while the Welsh Assembly Government has acted to deliver a debt lending product to small and medium-sized businesses, so far the Scottish Government is merely considering it.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4078</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Landlord Registration in Scotland, Three Years On</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report from Shelter Scotland, <em>Landlord registration in Scotland: three years on</em>, which examines the progress councils have made towards implementation of the landlord registration scheme to register all private landlords and agents; notes the concerns highlighted in the report that landlord registration is not yet fulfilling the expectations placed on it, and calls on the Scottish Government to review immediately the effectiveness of the landlord registration scheme in order to overcome the barriers preventing the system from working effectively, to clarify the aims of landlord registration to ensure that local authorities have the means and resources not only to administer the process of registering landlords but also to address worst practice and protect tenants, to ensure that tenants and landlords are fully aware of their renting rights and responsibilities and take action to get rid of the worst landlords and to introduce a mandatory tenant deposit scheme to protect tenants from rogue landlords.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4077</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Auchinairn Primary, Breathe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils of the asthma committee from Auchinairn Primary School in Bishopbriggs on creating a compelling short film called Breathe, with the assistance of deputy head teacher Kirsty Rawley and film makers Jimmy Watson and Andy Lenihan, and notes that the film highlights how life for children with asthma can be improved by a greater understanding of the condition among their friends and teachers.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4067.1</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> <strong>School Discipline</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4067) in the name of Elizabeth Smith, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports all appropriate measures to uphold the rights of teachers to teach and pupils to learn in a disciplined environment; notes the significant steps made by the previous administration to achieve this including the setting up of the Discipline Task Group, the removal of restrictions on head teachers to exclude pupils if necessary, the use of special units, support for teacher training, reduced class sizes and more classroom assistants, and calls on the Scottish Government to address the recent decline in teacher numbers and support staff, including behaviour support staff, and to work in partnership with key stakeholders to put in place a framework for a discipline code in every school incorporating rights and responsibilities for head teachers, teachers, parents and pupils.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4067.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>School Discipline</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4067) in the name of Elizabeth Smith, insert at end &quot;and further believes that the Scottish Government should engage closely with pupils, staff, the voluntary sector and other partner organisations to improve formal and non-formal learning opportunities for young people to ensure that they are not excluded from education.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4067.3</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>School Discipline</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4067) in the name of Elizabeth Smith, leave out from &quot;as called&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the 11% reduction in exclusions from Scottish schools from 2006-07 to 2007-08; acknowledges that appropriate support should be provided to the small number of children and young people who persistently misbehave; further acknowledges that head teachers already have considerable power over school discipline through their responsibility for school discipline policies and their devolved responsibility for excluding pupils; agrees that the future policy on behaviour in schools should be informed by the survey currently being conducted by the University of Edinburgh on behalf of the Scottish Government, which will provide in-depth information on this area, and further welcomes the comments in the HM Inspectorate of Education report, Improving Scottish Education 2005-2008, in relation to secondary schools, which states &quot;In almost all schools, climate and relationships are constructive and encouraging. While many schools have small numbers of young people with particularly challenging behaviour, any issues arising are usually handled effectively. Most schools have clear and concerted strategies for promoting positive behaviour&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4065.1</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Community Courts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4065) in the name of Bill Aitken, insert at end &quot;and further believes that the Scottish Government should reverse its decision and seek to progress plans for a community court in Glasgow.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4065.2</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Community Courts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4065) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from &quot;and believes&quot; to &quot;custody&quot; and insert &quot;notes that the independent business plan in March 2009 anticipated numerous benefits from a community court project, including improved community safety, greater offender accountability and reduced rates of reoffending; believes that the cancellation of the community court project also undermines the Scottish Government&rsquo;s own stated commitment to replace short-term prison sentences with tough and effective community sentences, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue to work with the Community Justice Project Board.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4065.3</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Community Courts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4065) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that community courts based on the New York City model in Midtown can help to address patterns of offending behaviour by providing for swift and effective summary justice coupled with a range of rehabilitation services to break the cycle of reoffending; notes the decision by the project board for the Glasgow Community Justice Centre that in the current economic circumstances they should not proceed with the development of a new court building, and supports the joint work underway between Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government to identify how best offenders can pay back for their crimes to the communities most in need of reinvestment and local services can be directed to support offenders out of a life of crime.&quot;</p>
