            Scanlon: Men's Health Week, Scotland: 7-14 September 2001</strong>—That 
            the Parliament pledges its support for Men’s Health Week, Scotland, 
            from 7 to 14 September 2001; acknowledges the collaboration between 
            Men’s Health Forum Scotland, health boards, the business sector, community 
            health initiatives and the voluntary sector to publicise Men’s Health 
            Week, Scotland; recognises that the majority of factors which impact 
            negatively on men’s health are preventable; notes that 75% of suicides 
            are male and almost 60% of premature male deaths are from coronary 
            heart disease and cancer, yet men attend their GPs less than half 
            as often as women; further notes that co-ordinated efforts are necessary 
            to ensure that men take responsibility for their health and that services 
            commit themselves to the challenge of working with men, and believes 
            that MSPs should support the collaboration by promoting positive messages 
            about men’s health and Men’s Health Week, Scotland, thereby encouraging 
            more men to take responsibility for their own health and well-being.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2065</strong> <strong>Tommy 
            Sheridan: Abolition of the Scottish Conveyancing and Executory Services 
            Board</strong>—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the abolition 
            of the Scottish Conveyancing and Executory Services Board; notes that 
            this body’s role was to provide low cost alternatives to lawyers’ 
            services, and therefore expresses its dismay that its functions should 
            be handed to the Law Society which is generally recognised as the 
            organisation that protects lawyers’ interests.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2064#</strong> <strong>Brian 
            Adam: Auchmill Road Chaos</strong>—That the Parliament expresses concern 
            at the continuing traffic chaos in Auchmill Road, Aberdeen; expresses 
            sympathy for the residents and road users who are being greatly inconvenienced 
            for the second successive summer because of major road works on the 
            same stretch of trunk road, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should ensure that all utility and highway maintenance works on Scotland’s 
            trunk routes are coordinated.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2063</strong> <strong>Mr 
            Adam Ingram: SIGN Guidelines on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</strong>—That 
            the Parliament welcomes the long-awaited guidelines produced by the 
            Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network on attention deficit hyperactivity 
            disorder; further acknowledges the request that non-pharmacological 
            support is provided to complement drug therapy; notes the current 
            financial constraints on local authorities, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to make a commitment to resource the needs expressed in 
            the guidelines. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2062</strong> <strong>Richard 
            Lochhead: Grampian Out-of-Hours GP Co-operative</strong>—That the Parliament 
            recognises the vital service provided to the public in Grampian by 
            the out-of-hours GP co-operative G-DOCS; expresses concern over the 
            projected shortfall for this financial year that places a question 
            mark over the service’s future; recognises that many GPs may opt for 
            early retirement should this service cease while others, particularly 
            female GPs, may avoid out-of-hours calls given that there would be 
            a reduction in security, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
            intervene to ensure that there is sufficient funding for G-DOCS in 
            order to maintain the service provided to patients, particularly in 
            rural areas of Grampian.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2061#</strong> <strong>Shona 
            Robison: Euro 2008</strong>—That the Parliament supports the campaign to 
            have Dundee included as a venue in the bid for the finals of the 2008 
            European Nations Championships; urges the Executive to support the 
            principle of locating a number of stadia outwith the central belt 
            of Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Premier League should 
            relax its rules on clubs sharing grounds.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2060</strong> <strong>Alex 
            Fergusson: Resumption of Livestock Auctions</strong>—That the Parliament 
            <a name="MotionText">notes that there have been no outbreaks of foot-and-mouth 
            disease in Scotland during the month of June and in the absence of 
            any practical alternative course of action to enable the large numbers 
            of store and breeding stock to be sold to generate much needed income 
            for the livestock sector at this time, urges the Scottish Executive 
            to put in place the necessary procedures to enable the resumption 
            of livestock auctions in mid-August, while recognising that these 
            procedures will need to be reviewed in the event of any further outbreaks 
            of foot-and-mouth disease.</a><strong><i> R</i></strong></font></p>
