            <a name="MotionText">notes with concern the decision to announce a 
            one year contract for the Glasgow to Barra air link; recognises that 
            such contracts are normally awarded for the three years of a public 
            service obligation (PSO) order; recognises the unanimous view of the 
            community that any loss of the direct air link would result in damage 
            to the local economy and tourism and create hardship for those attending 
            hospital and receiving life-saving treatment in Glasgow and beyond; 
            notes that the Deputy Minister for Transport, Lewis Macdonald MSP, 
            attended a meeting on the island of Barra and assured islanders that 
            their genuine concerns would be taken seriously and fed into the Scottish 
            Executive review; further recognises that this proposal is undermining 
            confidence in the long-term viability of the air service, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should ensure that the review is completed 
            on or before the end of March.</a> </p>
