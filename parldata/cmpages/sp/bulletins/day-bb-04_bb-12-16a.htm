          <p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Thursday 16 December 2004</strong></p>
          <p>9.30 am&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions </p>
          <p>&#9;The Clerk has been advised of the topics of the following Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Business</p>
          <p><EM>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Proposed Defence Reviews from a Scottish Perspective&mdash; </p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-2165</strong> <STRONG>Murdo Fraser:</STRONG> <STRONG>Proposed Defence Reviews from a Scottish Perspective</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposed cuts in manpower from the Royal Air Force, the Royal Navy and Army throughout the United Kingdom; further notes that this would mean the merger of the Royal Scots and the King&rsquo;s Own Scottish Borderers into one battalion and the amalgamation of all five battalions into a super regiment of five battalions and a reduction in jobs and operations at RAF Lossiemouth and Kinloss; believes that this will have an adverse economic impact on the areas affected by the cuts; further believes that the Scottish regiments are an important part of the tradition and heritage of Scotland; notes that the recent war in Iraq was the latest conflict which showed Scotland&rsquo;s regiments to be a modern, effective fighting force; believes that, in a time of increased commitments across the globe, our armed forces must have the necessary resources and structure to protect our country, deter aggression and safeguard our vital interests in the wider world, and, accordingly, condemns any cuts and mergers and, in particular, believes that the six existing single battalion Scottish infantry regiments should be retained. </p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-2165.4</strong> <STRONG>Mr John Home Robertson: Proposed Defence Reviews from a Scottish Perspective</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2165) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the importance of Scotland&rsquo;s substantial contribution to the armed forces of the United Kingdom; notes the social and economic value of the military to communities throughout Scotland; believes that Scotland is rightly proud of the historic and current contribution of Scottish service personnel to the defence of the United Kingdom and to peacekeeping operations worldwide; accepts the need for the military to drive decisions about the structure of efficient armed forces for the modern world, and believes that the traditions, community links and identities of Scotland&rsquo;s infantry battalions should be maintained in the armed forces of the United Kingdom.&quot; </p>
          <p> <STRONG>S2M-2165.3</strong> <STRONG>Roseanna Cunningham: Proposed Defence Reviews from a Scottish Perspective</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2165) in the name of Murdo Fraser, insert at end &quot;and condemns the fact that these proposals have been developed while Black Watch soldiers and other members of the armed forces are involved in a dangerous conflict in Iraq.&quot; </p>
          <p> <STRONG>S2M-2165.1</strong> <STRONG>Mike Rumbles: Proposed Defence Reviews from a Scottish Perspective</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2165) in the name of Murdo Fraser, insert at end &quot;as the best way to maintain the operational effectiveness of the Scottish infantry.&quot; </p>
          <p><EM>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffending&mdash; </p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-2158</strong> <STRONG>Miss Annabel Goldie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffending</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the unacceptable rate of reoffending occurring in Scotland today; accepts that there is a place in our criminal justice system for a range of different sentencing options to address this problem but recognises that when a prison sentence is the appropriate disposal then prison is not simply a punishment but is intended to rehabilitate, deter and protect the public; believes that the way to reduce reoffending and subsequently the prison population is to reduce the overall incidence of crime in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to increase the police presence in our communities to deter and detect crime and to end automatic early release from our prisons to ensure honesty in sentencing. </p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-2158.3</strong> <STRONG>Hugh Henry: Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffending</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2158) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;unacceptable&quot; to end and insert &quot;Criminal Justice Plan&rsquo;s acknowledgement that the rate of reoffending occurring in Scotland today is unacceptable; agrees that prison should be used where prison is the appropriate punishment but notes that prison is also intended to rehabilitate the offender, deter the prospective offender and protect the public; agrees that prison must sit within a range of different sentencing options to address reoffending, and therefore notes the increase in police numbers compared to the numbers delivered by the Conservatives, the establishment of the Sentencing Commission to consider a number of issues including early release, and that the recently published Criminal Justice Plan includes measures to tackle Scotland's high reoffending rates, reduce crime and the fear of crime and strengthen confidence in the country's criminal justice services.&quot; </p>
          <p> <STRONG>S2M-2158.2</strong> <STRONG>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffending</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2158) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;accepts&quot; to end and insert &quot;further notes that the causes of crime are manifold, involving social and economic dislocation and family and community fragmentation with drink, drugs and deprivation remaining at the root of much crime and antisocial behaviour; notes with concern that Scotland is heading towards having the highest per capita prison population in western Europe; calls, therefore, for a visible police presence in our communities and for prison to be reserved for serious and dangerous offenders; calls for action to be taken to ensure that community-based disposals are available for minor offences to ensure rehabilitation and best use of public funds; calls, therefore, on the Executive to ensure that it is not only tough on crime but tough on the causes of crime, and recognises that the solutions are multifaceted and require individuals to take responsibility for their own actions and for society to take responsibility for all its communities.&quot; </p>
          <p> <STRONG>S2M-2158.1</strong> <STRONG>Colin Fox: Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffending</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2158) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;the way&quot; to end and insert &quot;, since 80% of male and female prisoners represent no danger to the public, non-custodial sentences should be given much greater consideration and support; calls on the Scottish Executive to provide more specially-trained community police officers accountable to the communities that they serve in order to increase public confidence in the justice system, and reaffirms that, in cases where serious crimes have been committed, remission should be earned and fully recognised by both the wider community and the prison population itself.&quot; </p>

          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-2166.2</strong> <STRONG>Brian Adam: Tourism - Ambitions for Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2166) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, leave out from &quot;approves&quot; to end and insert &quot;further recognises that tourism requires good access and good tourism experiences as well as marketing strategies; expresses concern over the uncertainties introduced by the Tourism Network Scotland (TNS) project, including potential compulsory redundancies, the financial shortfall and lack of a detailed business plan; commends the development of niche marketing strategies and the extension of the seasonal events to ensure that all Scotland benefits from a growing industry; seeks continued commitment to improving access through the Route Development Fund and a strategy for dealing with the consequences of changes to structural funds, and calls on the Scottish Executive, contingent upon production of the TNS business plan, to consider making available transitional funding to address any shortfall due to potential loss of membership income, local authority funding, redundancy costs and the ongoing structural deficit.&quot; </p>
