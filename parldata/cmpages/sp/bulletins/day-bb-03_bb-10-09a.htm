          <p>9.30 am&#9;Debate on Creating an Enterprise Culture in Scotland's

          <p><strong>S2M-467</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Creating 
            an Enterprise Culture in Scotland's Schools</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the &quot;can do, will do&quot; attitude the Scottish Executive's 
            strategy for enterprise in education aims to engender among young 
            people; notes that it is a priority of the Partnership Agreement to 
            deliver the strategy in partnership with local authorities and businesses, 
            and looks forward to the <em>Determined to Succeed</em> strategy giving 
            young people the skills they need to take an entrepreneurial spirit 
            from the classroom into a confident and prosperous Scotland. </p>

              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>

                Culture in Scotland's Schools</strong>-As an amendment to motion

                spirit required to take up and create rewarding options in a new 
                and increasingly competitive Scotland, which has full control 
                of its own economy.&quot; </p>

                Enterprise Culture in Scotland's Schools</strong>-As an amendment

                &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the necessity 
                of creating an enterprise culture in Scotland in order to help 
                reverse our economic decline; welcomes any moves to encourage 
                young people to become more entrepreneurial but understands that 
                what the business sector primarily looks for from school leavers 
                are skills in literacy, numeracy, communication and timekeeping, 
                and accordingly calls upon the Scottish Executive to take steps 
                to reduce the unacceptable number of school pupils failing to 
                meet basic standards in reading and writing, widen access to vocational 
                courses at further education colleges for 14 and 15-year-olds, 
                and increase opportunities for school pupils to experience work 
                placements.&quot; </p>

                &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;considers that the 
                <em>Determined to</em> <em>Succeed</em> strategy should strive 
                to deliver the development of self-confident, skilled young people 
                with a &quot;can do, will do&quot; attitude who can create environmentally 
                and socially sustainable businesses and shape successful communities; 
                requires that enterprise be fully integrated with teaching on 
                citizenship, social obligation and sustainability, and calls on 
                the Scottish Executive to ensure that locally-based voluntary 
                and social enterprises play a full and equal part alongside other 
                businesses in helping young people to develop ideas and skills.&quot;
