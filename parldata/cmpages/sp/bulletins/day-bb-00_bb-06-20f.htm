    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-1023#</b> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh: Failure to Reinstate Arbroath to
    Assisted Area Status</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision not to
    reinstate Arbroath to the Assisted Area boundary proposals; recognises the strength of
    Arbroath&#146;s case for re-inclusion and the potentially devastating effect exclusion
    could have on the local economy; understands that, whilst this is a reserved matter, the
    Scottish Executive has worked closely with the Scotland Office and the Department of Trade
    and Industry in formulating the Assisted Area map in Scotland; requests that the Scottish
    Executive state clearly the criteria on which this decision was made, and invites the
    Executive to seek reconsideration of this decision. </p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-1022</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: North Lanarkshire Council Direct Labour
    Organisation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the improved performance of North
    Lanarkshire Council Direct Labour Organisation (DLO) which produced a surplus of £1.59
    million in financial year 1999-2000 and is estimated to produce a surplus of £1.457
    million in the current financial year, despite being expected to trade internally for only
    nine months; congratulates the workforce for their tremendous efforts in turning around a
    serious deficit two years ago into a healthy surplus, which will provide extra finance for
    North Lanarkshire Council either to improve council services to the citizens of North
    Lanarkshire or reduce any council tax rises for the citizens of the area; calls upon the
    Scottish Executive in the light of this excellent performance by the DLO workforce to lift
    the statutory determination which is forcing the council to privatise its DLO service and
    workforce; recognises the immense benefits to local authority areas of DLOs, and believes
    that the current statutory determination being imposed on North Lanarkshire is completely
    unnecessary and does not represent best value for the citizens of the North Lanarkshire
    Council area.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-1021</b> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Salmon Farming Industry</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the vital contribution to the fragile local economy of Sutherland
    made by Scottish-owned salmon farming companies and urges the Scottish Executive to
    examine ways that the regulatory framework as applied to the salmon farming industry can
    be streamlined and simplified for the benefit of the industry, environment and ultimately
    customers.</p>
