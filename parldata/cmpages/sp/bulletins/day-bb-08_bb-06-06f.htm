<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2083</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Graham&rsquo;s: The Family Dairy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scotland&rsquo;s largest independent dairy, Graham&rsquo;s, for its fine achievement in winning another award at the Scottish Food and Drink Excellence Awards in 2008; recognises that the Bridge of Allan-based family business plays a vital role in both the national and local economy and employs around 270 members of staff, and further notes the health benefits of milk in improving eyesight and building stronger bones and teeth.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2082</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Stamp Duty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in light of increased household and fuel costs and the so-called &quot;credit crunch&quot; with its increasingly devastating effects on house sales in Scotland, itself impacting on small businesses such as removal firms, building trades and many others and blocking the movement of house sales so that first time buyers are effectively barred from the property ladder, considers that a review of Stamp Duty, which has remained constant since 2006, is imperative and that such a review should consider increasing the threshold for the 0% band and, on subsequent bands, making duty payable only incrementally and not on the entire purchase price and that this is one small method of easing the burden on first-time buyers and freeing up the housing market.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2081</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Violence is Preventable Booklet, See Us &ndash; Hear Us!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the recent launch of the Violence is Preventable (VIP) booklet, <em>See Us &ndash; Hear Us!</em>; acknowledges and encourages the work that VIP carries out with young people who have been victims of sexual abuse; welcomes the fact that the booklet is targeted at staff and others working in schools and youth organisations to increase their awareness and understanding of this complex issue and to make disclosure easier by providing, when possible, a safe and unthreatening environment in schools where fears and apprehensions can be discussed before appropriate action is taken; commends the content of the booklet drawn from the research of Sarah Nelson, one of Scotland&rsquo;s leading writers and campaigners against child sexual abuse (CSA), and recognises the tremendous value of this research in that it catalogues the educational experiences of survivors of CSA from Eighteen And Under in Dundee, Pathway in Edinburgh with input from Barnardo&rsquo;s Skylight project in Edinburgh and the Nationwide Foundation, and hopes that <em>See Us &ndash; Hear Us!</em>, currently available in schools in Dundee and Edinburgh, will also be available in schools in Lanarkshire, Falkirk, Ayrshire and throughout Scotland in an effort to increase the confidence of pupils and staff in dealing with this harrowing issue and in order to make significant progress in attempting to break down &quot;the wall of silence&quot; on the subject, which is the perpetrator&rsquo;s best friend.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2080</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Amnesty International Scottish Media Awards 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the 2008 Amnesty International Scottish Media Awards, especially the winner, Fiona Walker of BBC Scotland, for her &quot;Refugees from Congo to Motherwell&quot; report and runner-up Billy Briggs for his &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; <em>Scotland on Sunday </em>Spectrum magazine report; notes that the awards have become an established part of the media calendar, and believes that the awards have an important role to play in encouraging journalists in Scotland to raise the profile of human rights issues in their work.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2079</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Accessible Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Inclusion Scotland on organising and holding its Homes for Life conference in Glasgow on 17 June 2008; recognises that the availability of accessible housing is of vital concern to disabled people and welcomes its efforts to bring this issue to the attention of housing associations, planners, home designers, house builders and local and national decision makers, and looks forward to a future when the adoption of best practice in planning, design and house building means that all people will be able to acquire houses suitable to their needs and to continue to live in their own homes if they acquire an impairment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2078</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Learning the Lessons of Manchester</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the overwhelming majority of football supporters who visited Manchester for the UEFA Cup Final between Glasgow Rangers and Zenit St Petersburg were impeccably behaved, that any issues in relation to the planning and management of the cup final provided no excuse for a mindless minority of individuals who do not represent Glasgow Rangers Football Club and that the deeply regrettable events in Manchester should be used as an opportunity to reduce the likelihood of such scenes ever happening again; calls on the Scottish Government to take the lead in helping to co-ordinate efforts to ensure that lessons are learned and that all stakeholders, including the Scottish and UK governments, local authorities, football clubs and the police, work closely together on such matters, and further believes that where legislative changes may be necessary, such as in the case of ensuring that football banning orders handed out in England can be enforced in Scotland, such changes are implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2077</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Centenary of the Vatersay Raiders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that it is 100 years since the 10 fishermen from Barra and Mingulay, who sought to establish crofts as a way of life on Vatersay, appeared at the Court of Session in Edinburgh accused of breaching an interdict imposed upon them by the absentee landlord, Lady Gordon Cathcart; notes that their two month imprisonment caused an outcry across Scotland, leading the Government to buy Vatersay for crofting; further notes that today the descendants of the raiders still live on Vatersay with a causeway now linking them to the larger island of Barra, built in order to avoid abandonment by the population of Vatersay as befell Mingulay, and notes that it was the Labour-led Scottish Executive that led the way in introducing land reform measures to give communities such as Gigha and South Uist greater control of their land and how it is managed and giving them greater power to shape their own futures, following the example of the Assynt crofters and the people of Eigg and Knoydart.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2076</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>40th Anniversary of Death of Robert F Kennedy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 5 June 2008 is the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Senator Robert Francis Kennedy, shot shortly after winning the California primary contest for the Democratic Presidential nomination for the 1968 election; regrets that this act of violence robbed the world of a politician of genuine humanity and conviction, and conveys its condolences to the Kennedy family and its best wishes to his last surviving brother, Senator Edward Kennedy, for a speedy recovery from his recent illness.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2075</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Netting Youth Disorder</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Central Scotland Police on its recent crackdown on antisocial behaviour through investigation of the social networking site Bebo; notes that the success of the operation included interviewing 182 young people aged between 12 and 18 about issues such as underage drinking, drug-related activities and weapon possession; recognises that this casts doubts on the effectiveness of social networking sites&rsquo; content control, and expresses unease that the readiness displayed by these young people to put photographs of their actions online, given current concerns over child protection and safeguarding vulnerable persons, undermines an otherwise excellent and extremely popular facility for young people to communicate with each other.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2074</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Sporting Edinburgh Pupils</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the 44 talented pupils from 16 schools including Gracemount High School, Liberton High School and James Gillespie&rsquo;s High School in South Edinburgh involved in the City of Edinburgh Schools Sports Academy; notes that 36 pupils have progressed to regional and national squad level from just two in that position at the outset of the academy; welcomes the decision by the City of Edinburgh Council to expand the academy by an expected further 30 pupils next year, and praises the academy&rsquo;s already excellent contribution to Scottish grass-roots sport in just its first year of operation.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2073</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Supporting Scottish Culture</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the valuable work of Scottish cultural organisations, including the Traditional Music and Song Association, the Scottish Traditions of Dance Trust, the Scots Music Group, Voluntary Arts Scotland, the Scots Language Centre, and Scots Language Dictionaries, which promote and support extensive voluntary participation in Scottish traditional arts and culture; notes the extreme difficulties these organisations now face as a result of their loss of funding from the Scottish Arts Council; further notes that while existing funding runs to March 2009, the reality of redundancies and the termination of accommodation and office facilities means that their activity will be severely curtailed later this year; recognises that the audit of Scots language provision, even if completed in time, is unlikely to provide more than a partial solution to the problem; believes that the Scottish Arts Council cannot be trusted to support and promote the Scots language and Scottish traditional arts and sees no reason to suspect that Creative Scotland will be any different, and therefore believes that a separately constituted and funded body should be set up for this purpose and interim measures put in place to safeguard existing provision until this is done.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2072</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Scottish Register of Tartans Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Scottish Register of Tartans Bill.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2060</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>No to New Nuclear Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by the UK Government of its intention to expand its nuclear programme; further notes that no nuclear power stations have ever been developed and maintained without substantial public subsidy which inevitably comes at the cost of investment in other areas such as developing clean renewable technologies; recognises the soaring costs of dealing with the existing legacy of radioactive waste from ageing nuclear facilities, with the decommissioning bill set to rise above &pound;73 billion; notes that in 2006 Scotland could have supplied 92.5% of its electricity needs from non-nuclear sources, with electricity generated by non-hydro renewables having increased by 46% over the previous year; believes that further investment in nuclear energy would be a wasteful, dangerous and unnecessary distraction from developing Scotland&rsquo;s renewable industry, and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s reaffirmation that there will be no new nuclear stations in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2060.1</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>No to New Nuclear Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2060) in the name of Shirley-Anne Somerville, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;is concerned at the ideological folly of the Scottish Government in proposing closing down Scotland&rsquo;s main source of carbon-free electricity, the nuclear power industry; regrets the loss of highly-skilled, well-paid jobs that this will entail; applauds the excellent work being done in Scottish universities in support of the nuclear power industry and wonders if the SNP administration intends to close it down also, and believes that the short-sighted hostility to civil nuclear power is likely to turn Scotland into an importer of electricity within a relatively short space of time, probably relying for baseload on nuclear imports from England and beyond.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2033</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Proposed Change to the National Concessionary Travel Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the petition by Sally Ann Elfverson on behalf of the Learning Disability Alliance Scotland on the National Concessionary Travel Scheme; notes that the Cross-Party Group on Learning Disability supports this petition; believes that the National Concessionary Travel Scheme should be urgently reviewed to extend eligibility to disabled people in receipt of the lower rate of disability living allowance, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement this and other desirable changes to the scheme in consultation with people with learning disabilities.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2033.1</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Proposed Change to the National Concessionary Travel Scheme</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2033) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that the existing eligibility criterion, which excludes disabled people in receipt of the lower rate of disability allowance, was set by the former administration and that the future of the National Concessionary Travel Scheme will be determined by the Scottish Government in due course, following the review of the scheme later this year.&quot;</p>
