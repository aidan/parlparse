the Parliament welcomes the document <em>Closing the Opportunity Gap: Scottish

set out in <em>Building a Better Scotland &#150; spending Proposals 2003-06: What 
the money buys</em>, will deliver a better life for the most disadvantaged people 
and communities in Scotland and agrees that the Executive&#146;s social justice 
spending plans for the next three years will improve outcomes for those people 
and communities, through investing in their homes and neighbourhoods</P><DIR>

to motion (S1M-3477) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;notes the failure of the Scottish Executive to make any 
improvement in the field of social justice; further notes its inability to close 
the opportunity gap; agrees that the lack of adequate powers of the Executive 
and the Parliament perpetuates inequalities, and calls for the return of full 
parliamentary powers to Scotland.&quot; </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3477.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Mrs

to end and insert &quot;notes the document <em>Closing the Opportunity Gap: Scottish 
Budget for 2003-06</em>; believes that the Scottish Executive&#146;s centralised, 
target-based approach will prevent the most vulnerable from realising their full 
potential, and further notes that the best way to close the opportunity gap is 
to offer vulnerable people real choice and diversity through reform of public 
services and to promote a low-tax market economy which creates jobs and allows 
our vulnerable people to lift themselves out of the poverty trap, thereby delivering 
a better life for all.&quot; </P></DIR></DIR><P><em>followed by</em>&#9;Parliamentary

Highland 2008</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the on-going competition 
to decide the United Kingdom&#146;s nominee for the European Capital of Culture 
in 2008; further notes that Inverness Highland 2008 is the sole Scottish bid; 
recognises the imaginative plans that the bid team have proposed including capitalising 
on the Highlands&#146; unique culture and the development of a cultural plan; 
further recognises the immense economic, social and cultural benefits that a successful 
bid would bring to Inverness and the Highlands, and considers that, as this is 
the sole Scottish bid, the Scottish Executive, MSPs, government agencies and the 
wider Scottish society should do all in their power to support the bid and promote 
a successful outcome.<STRONG><em> </em></STRONG></P></DIR><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
