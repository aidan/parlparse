          <p><strong>*S1M-2370#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Battlefields</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should undertake 
            archaeological research to establish the correct site of the Battle 
            of Bannockburn and that sites of this and other important Scottish 
            battlefields should be safeguarded from further development.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2369#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Public Access 
            to the Parliament</strong>&#151;That the Parliament considers that 
            the layout of the Holyrood Parliament buildings should allow the easiest 
            possible public access to the Parliament and simple arrangements for 
            members of the public to meet MSPs and that it should be possible 
            for any additional security measures introduced at times of crisis 
            to be easily dismantled, and asks the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
            Body to report to the Parliament on this aspect of their work.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2368</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson: People Management 
            in Scottish Universities</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            statements made by the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
            in her letter of 23 November 2000 to the Chairman of the Scottish 
            Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) that &quot;staff are the 
            key resource of universities and colleges&quot; and that the Scottish 
            Executive &quot;must continually strive to improve people management, 
            staff development and succession planning&quot;; agrees with the minister&#146;s 
            comment in the same letter that &quot;a particular area where improvements 
            are required is in human resource policies and management&quot;; is 
            concerned that pay levels for female academic staff are almost 20% 
            lower than those for their male counterparts; recognises the importance 
            of research staff in Scotland&#146;s knowledge economy; further recognises 
            that over 90% of such staff are employed on insecure fixed-term contracts; 
            believes that greater job security in the higher education sector 
            can better enable the use of our science and social science research 
            base for the benefit of Scotland&#146;s economy and society; welcomes 
            the Executive&#146;s commitment, outlined in its publication, <i>A 
            Science Strategy for Scotland</i>, to &quot;encourage funders and 
            employers to ensure good career and staff development for those engaged 
            in scientific research&quot;; calls upon the minister to press for 
            improvements in people management by more detailed guidance to SHEFC 
            and to encourage SHEFC to promote and monitor such improvements through 
            specific conditions of grant and by ensuring that contracted members 
            of research staff are considered a key part of implementation of the 
            science strategy, and recommends to the minister, to SHEFC and to 
            universities the advantages of an approach in partnership with recognised 
            unions to tackle these key issues. <strong><i> R</i></strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2367</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon: Outdoor Access 
            for All</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the calls of 14,550 
            individuals and organisations from both Scotland and around the world, 
            including the Scottish Human Rights Centre, who have supported the 
            petition to the Parliament on outdoor access by the Scottish Environment 
            LINK Access Network, Scottish Sports Association and Scottish Countryside 
            Access Network and believes that the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill should 
            establish a right to responsible access for all and improve and confirm, 
            rather than threaten and restrict, access opportunities for all those 
            who enjoy Scotland's countryside and for those communities that depend 
            upon the business which derives from that access.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2366#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie: Consultation and 
            Advocacy Promotion Service</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Consultation and Advocacy Promotion Service on its 10th anniversary 
            and commends the work of the service in promoting and supporting the 
            collective involvement of mental health service users in Edinburgh, 
            Midlothian and East Lothian; further congratulates mindscape.org.uk 
            on the launch of its website on 18 June 2001, the aim of which is 
            to provide a forum for debate on mental health issues, supply information 
            for service users, their friends and families and to challenge stigma 
            and discrimination, and believes that the Scottish Executive should 
            continue to work towards ensuring that mental health service users 
            have access to appropriate services and levels of support. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2365</strong> <strong>John Young: Control and Storage 
            of Fireworks</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the injury, alarm and distress caused to the people of Scotland by 
            the irresponsible use of fireworks and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            in liaison with Her Majesty&#146;s Government to review the legislation 
            dealing with the control and storage of fireworks.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2364</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: Cast Ewe 
            Compensation Scheme</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns the 
            decision by the EU Standing Veterinary Committee to refuse to allow 
            Scottish lamb to be exported to EU markets; notes that the cull lamb 
            scheme established by the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural 
            Affairs Department in the wake of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak 
            has been substantially undersubscribed, and therefore strongly urges 
            the Scottish Executive to consider allocating the surplus funding 
            from the scheme to a disposal scheme for cast ewes and to address 
            the animal welfare problems and environmental damage that the onset 
            of winter is bringing.</p>

            Peterhead and Beacon Site Status</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            congratulates HM Prison Peterhead on becoming the first prison in 
            Scotland to be awarded Beacon Site Status as part of the Modernising 
            Government initiative and looks forward to the prison fulfilling its 
            role under the scheme whereby it will share the secrets of its success 
            with groups of visitors from across the United Kingdom and Scottish 
            governments. </p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2362</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie: Job Losses 
            in the West of Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the escalating job losses in the West of Scotland culminating 
            in the recent announcements from Rolls Royce in Hillington and Robinson 
            Nugent and Compaq in Inchinnan that further losses may be expected 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive, the affected companies and 
            all local and other relevant agencies to unite in seeking to maintain 
            economic activity in Renfrewshire and to offer every assistance to 
            those who lose jobs to find new jobs. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2361</strong> <strong>Mike Watson: Cosmic Rough Riders</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">congratulates everyone at C Sharp 
            Community recording studios in Castlemilk for their part in the success 
            of local band, the Cosmic Rough Riders, whose debut album <i>Enjoy 
            the Melodic Sunshine</i> has reached sales of 60,000 in the UK and, 
            as such, qualifies for a British Phonographic Industry Silver Disc 
            award; notes that this year the songs on recordings made at C Sharp 
            have been heard by the band&#146;s audiences during their tours of 
            the UK, the USA, Europe and Japan, and commends the work of community-based 
            studios like this which is evidence that the grass-roots music industry 
            is thriving across Scotland.</a></p>
