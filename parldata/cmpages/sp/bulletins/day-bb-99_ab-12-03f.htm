    </strong><p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-354</strong> <strong>Mr Murray Tosh on behalf of the Procedures Committee:
    First Report of the Procedures Committee</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the terms of
    the First Report of the Procedures Committee entitled<i> Draft Standing Orders of The
    Scottish Parliament</i> (SP Paper 28); approves the draft standing orders set out in annex
    4 of the Report and now makes the standing orders of the Parliament in terms of that
    draft, and agrees that those standing orders shall come into force on 17 December 1999.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-353#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Social and Economic Renewal of Glasgow</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with deep concern the findings of the recently published reports <i>Edinburgh
    and Glasgow: Competitiveness and Cohesion</i> and <i>The Widening Gap</i>; condemns the
    shocking complacency of Glasgow City Council, the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's
    Government in response to these reports, and demands an urgent, comprehensive and targeted
    multi-agency approach to social exclusion in Glasgow and the city&#146;s economic
    regeneration, learning from the successes and failures of the past and examining thriving
    models of urban renewal elsewhere.</p>

    </strong><p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-352</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: With-holding Lottery Money From Wembley</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises that the rebuilt Wembley Stadium will be inadequate for hosting
    athletics, despite receiving £120 million from the UK lottery on the understanding it
    could hold such events including the World Athletics Championships and the Olympic Games;
    notes that this follows on from a similar funding crisis recently at the National Stadium,
    Hampden Park; and supports the withholding of lottery money until such a time as Wembley
    can hold athletic events, or the redistribution of these funds to more pressing sports
    needs throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-351#</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Beauforts Dyke Disturbance</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the work done by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency,
    South Ayrshire council and other agencies in seeking to improve the marine environment of
    South West Scotland, but is concerned at the prospect of hazardous materials and munitions
    being distributed by the laying of underwater cables through the Beauforts Dyke region of
    the Irish Sea in order to service the Scotland to Northern Ireland Interconnector.</p>

    </strong><p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-350</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant: Support for Oil Fabrication Workers</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the recent announcement of job losses at the oil fabrication yards of
    Nigg and Ardersier; expresses its concern for the workers and their families that have
    been affected; congratulates Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Highland Council and others
    on the planning they have undertaken to address the help the workforce will need and on
    the joint working that is taking place, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to continue
    supporting the concerned parties, and to ensure continued working together to achieve
    practical and workable solutions for the long term.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-349#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: A9 Improvements</strong>&#151;That the

    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-348#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: National Concessionary Travel Scheme
    For Older People</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges the importance of affordable
    public transport for older people and urges the Scottish Executive to phase in a national
    concessionary travel scheme which includes bus, rail and ferry services in Scotland.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-347</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Nigel Tranter</strong>&#151;That the
