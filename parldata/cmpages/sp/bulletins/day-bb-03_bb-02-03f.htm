          <p><strong>*S1M-3838</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Mail Services 
            in the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Royal 
            Mail on the excellent service that it has provided to the Parliament 
            over the last four years; expresses concern that the contract has 
            been put out to tender and could be lost to cost-cutting anti-trade 
            union firms that do not share a public sector ethos, and calls on 
            the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to cancel this unnecessary 
            competitive process and re-award the contract to the Royal Mail. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3837</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: MV Princess Victoria</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of 
            the sinking of the MV Princess Victoria, one of the first roll-on 
            roll-off ferries brought into service between Scotland and Ireland 
            after the second world war; remember with great respect the 133 passengers 
            and crew lost on the afternoon of 31 January 1953, and pays tribute 
            to the bravery of the crews of the Royal Navy lifeboats from Portpatrick 
            and Donaghadee and HMS Contest who unsuccessfully attempted to locate 
            the stricken ferry in appalling conditions</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3836#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie: Scottish Trades 
            Union Movement</strong>-That the Parliament believes that a strong 
            trade union movement is an essential element of a healthy democratic 
            society and that the rights of workers should be strengthened not 
            diminished; congratulates the Scottish Executive on its willingness 
            to engage constructively with the trade union movement, and believes 
            that the concordat signed in April 2002 by the Scottish Executive 
            and the Scottish Trades Union Congress provides a sound basis for 
            continued co-operation.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3835</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Hillington 
            Park Innovation Centre</strong>-That the Parliament applauds the contribution 
            Hillington Park Innovation Centre (HPIC) is making in supporting new 
            companies with significant growth potential to establish themselves, 
            take root and diversify the Renfrewshire economy, increasing the potential 
            for indigenous small and medium enterprise growth; believes that, 
            since Scottish Enterprise Renfrewshire supported the establishment 
            of HPIC in 2000, the centre's high-quality building and infrastructure 
            have been helping secure Renfrewshire's attraction to businesses seeking 
            a strong, supportive and entrepreneurial environment supported by 
            an on-site innovation team providing business development support; 
            congratulates those responsible for a £16 million rise in turnover 
            and an employment level of 240 people created by 36 tenants occupying 
            over 80% of the lettable space with further employment opportunities 
            anticipated; supports HPIC's development of good relationships internationally 
            and with the University of Paisley and other universities, resulting 
            in the award of a Department of Trade and Industry Internet Incubator 
            Fund project, &quot;UNISP&quot;, which has so far provided support 
            to five new e-commerce-related businesses coming out of universities; 
            notes that HPIC is a recipient of the prestigious Scottish Property 
            award for innovation, and would like to add its own recognition to 
            this exciting enterprise.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3834#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie: Scottish Input to 
            the General Agreement on Trade in Services</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the current negotiations taking place through Her Majesty's 
            Government on the General Agreement on Trade in Services that covers 
            many areas that are within the Scottish Parliament's legislative competence; 
            notes the need to feed Scottish concerns into the negotiations, and 
            seeks assurances on the implications of article 1.3 that defines only 
            services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority that are 
            supplied neither on a commercial basis nor in competition with one 
            or more service suppliers as exempt.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3833</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Local Government 
            Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament endorses the principle 
            of including in the Local Government Bill powers for the Scottish 
            Ministers to issue directions and guidance to Scottish local authorities 
            in relation to staff transfer matters and agrees that the relevant 
            provisions to confer executive functions on the Scottish Ministers 
            in relation to these matters should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3832#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: University of Edinburgh 
            School of Informatics</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the 
            severity of the damage caused by the Old Town fire to the University 
            of Edinburgh's internationally renowned School of Informatics; congratulates 
            the University on the rapid action taken to minimise the impact of 
            the fire on its activities; supports the appeal to rebuild its unique 
            Artificial Intelligence library, and gives its full backing to the 
            University of Edinburgh's aspirations to accelerate the development 
            of its world-class research, teaching and technology transfer in this 
            field.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3831</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson: Cuban Economic 
            Embargo</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the United States (US) 
            Government's four-decade-old economic embargo against the people of 
            Cuba with the Helms-Burton trade barrier; notes the recent legal advice 
            provided to William Grant &amp; Sons, that in the US 21-year old Glenfiddich 
            Havana Reserve would fall foul of the trade barrier, purely because 
            the whisky is matured in Cuban rum casks; congratulates William Grant 
            &amp; Sons on persisting with the use of Cuban rum casks despite the 
            difficulties caused with the US market, and calls upon the current 
            US Government to end the unjustified trade embargo against the people 
            of Cuba.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3830#</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: European Commission 
            Directive on Food Supplements</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            millions of people use food supplements and herbal remedies in the 
            UK each year; regrets that the European Commission has published a 
            directive on food supplements that will firstly reduce the numbers 
            of supplements offered and secondly reduce the potency of those which 
            remain, and, whilst noting Her Majesty's Government's assurances that 
            such supplements will be treated as favourably as possible under UK 
            law, considers that the Scottish Executive should do everything within 
            its power to protect the right of consumers to continue to access 
            the full range of supplements currently available.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3829</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Centenary of 
            James McNeill Whistler (1834 - 1903)</strong>-That the Parliament 
            commends the hard work and efforts of all of the people associated 
            with the events taking place at The Hunterian Art Gallery, University 
            of Glasgow, to mark the centenary of the death of James McNeill Whistler 
            (1834-1903); notes that, while Whistler only visited Scotland once, 
            he had strong links with the country through his family and the influence 
            of his work, most notably on the Glasgow Boys; further notes that 
            one of the world's most important collections of Whistler's work is 
            held at the Hunterian Art Gallery and was presented to the University 
            of Glasgow by Whistler's heir, Rosalind Birnie Philip, in recognition 
            of his Scottish links and the conferral of an honorary degree on him 
            in 1903; applauds the sterling efforts of all concerned in securing 
            the return to Glasgow on loan from the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, for the 
            first time in half a century, of Whistler's most famous work, <em>Arrangement 
            in Grey and Black No. 1: Portrait of the Painter's Mother</em> (1871), 
            and in explaining the significance of the painting for Whistler, its 
            acquisition by the Mus&eacute;e du Luxembourg in 1891 and its continuing 
            life as an icon and inspiration for satirists, cartoonists, copyists 
            and others; commends the work of the Centre for Whistler Studies at 
            the University of Glasgow in preparing an edition of the 10,000 letters 
            in the Whistler correspondence, highlighting his contacts with artists, 
            critics, dealers, models, patrons, publishers and many more and demonstrating 
            that he was known as much for his sharp wit as for his art during 
            the half-century from 1855 to 1903, and is encouraged by the support 
            lent by LloydsTSB Scotland for a range of Whistler 2003 exhibitions 
            and events as part of a Glasgow-wide festival running throughout the 
            year.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3828</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Cockenzie House</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the threatened and imminent closure 
            of Cockenzie House in Cockenzie, a private nursing home currently 
            with 56 residents aged from 50 to 90, due to persistent under-funding 
            by the local authority; further notes that by 31 March 2003 it is 
            probable that those 56 frail people will lose what is now their home 
            and that this is yet another example of the loss of local provision 
            for the frail and elderly, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
            take immediate steps nationwide to provide urgent funding in the interests 
            of those who are our most vulnerable citizens.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3828.1</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson: Cockenzie 
            House</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3828) in the name of 
            Christine Grahame, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end 
            and insert &quot;the concern of residents, relatives and staff about 
            the future of Cockenzie House Nursing Home; further notes the very 
            substantial increase in funding from the Scottish Executive for nursing 
            home fees in 2002, in addition to the free personal care package, 
            and welcomes the progress of discussions about another substantial 
            uprating in 2003; commends the efforts of East Lothian Council to 
            help the proprietor of Cockenzie House by seeking to take up empty 
            places in the home, and endorses the council's determination to do 
            everything in its power to safeguard the residents and, while acknowledging 
            the right of the owner to sell Cockenzie House, urges him to resolve 
            the uncertainty by selling the home as a going concern.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3827#</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Towns Review</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the invaluable contribution that Scotland's 
            towns make to national life and the fabric of society, notes with 
            concern the current lack of plans to carry out a towns review and 
            provide funds on a similar basis as for cities, and believes that 
            a review should be carried out, as a matter of urgency, to promote 
            and restore vitality in Scotland's towns which would result in job 
            creation, enhanced service provision, improved infrastructure and 
            a boost to civic pride.</p>

            officer, and Christine Fulton, widow of Constable Lewis Fulton of 
            Strathclyde Police who was the last officer to be murdered on duty 
            in Scotland in June 1994; notes that the purpose of the trust is to 
            identify a suitable location and build and maintain a national memorial 
            to all Scottish police officers who have lost their lives in the line 
            of duty, and considers that the Scottish Executive should support 
            this initiative. </p>

            Her Majesty's Government to introduce legislation to take new powers 
            of direction over the fire service; is mindful that under the Scotland 
            Act 1998 the Scottish Parliament has legislative competence for all 
            fire service matters in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive 
            to develop a distinctive Scottish Fire Service as outlined in the 
            consultation paper <em>The Scottish Fire Service of the Future</em> 
            and to make it clear to Her Majesty's Government that any legislation

          <p><strong>S1M-3821#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Crime in the

            level of crime in Grampian; believes that this is largely linked to 
            substance misuse; recognises that substance misuse and consequent 
            crime affect<strike>s</strike> both urban and rural communities in 
            the region; notes that Aberdeen has the highest level of break-ins

            of overall crime; notes that Grampian has the highest level of crimes 
            of dishonesty in Scotland; believes that the situation is not helped

            is exacerbated by the length of time that drug misusers must wait 
            for treatment from local services, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should investigate the level of crime in Grampian and take

          <p><strong>S1M-3820#</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson: New Forth

            welcomes the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with the 
            new Forth road bridge crossing upstream from the Kincardine Bridge; 
            notes the decision by the Forth Valley NHS Board to recommend to the 
            Scottish Executive that there should be a new single site acute hospital 
            and that the favoured site should be at the Royal Scottish National 
            Hospital, Larbert; recognises the very real difficulties in access 
            to the proposed site for patients from Clackmannanshire, West Fife 
            and Stirling, and considers that the Scottish Executive should do 
            all in its power to ensure that the bridge is completed as soon as 
            possible and that, in considering any site for the new hospital, the 
            road networks will provide equity of access to all residents in Forth

          <p><strong>S1M-3819</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Statement by the 
            Deputy Prime Minister on the Fire Service</strong>-That the Parliament 
            condemns the dictatorial attempt by the Deputy Prime Minister to impose 
            a new national settlement on the firefighters; believes that this 
            is a prelude to cutting the numbers of firefighters, fire stations 
            and level of firecover and is a threat to the people of Scotland and 
            the UK as a whole, and demands that the Scottish Executive resists 
            these attempts and continues the normal process of negotiations and 
            agreement with trade unions.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3813</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: World Economic Forum, 
            Davos, 2003</strong>-That the Parliament notes the attendance of Patricia 
            Hewitt, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, at the meeting 
            of the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, Switzerland, on 23 to 
            27 January 2003; notes that the WEF is a meeting of business leaders 
            and politicians to discuss world social and economic policy; notes 
            that previous meetings of the WEF have seen promises from chief executives 
            of multinational corporations about their aspirations to achieve social 
            and environmental responsibility; believes that voluntary action by 
            corporations on environment and social issues is not delivering sustainability, 
            and therefore urges the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry 
            to propose binding rules on corporations in order that they can be 
            held accountable for their environmental and social impacts.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3812</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Torness Nuclear 
            Power Station</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Torness Nuclear 
            Power Station was recently fined £15,000 for dumping radioactive materials 
            in the sea; notes that Scotland does not need Torness to produce electricity 
            and that it and the other nuclear power stations are a major economic 
            burden to the taxpayer, and therefore calls for Torness to be closed 
            and the workforce to be redeployed to decommission the plant.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3810</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Private Finance 
            Initiative</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent findings 
            of the Audit Commission report into Private Finance Initiative (PFI) 
            in schools in England which compared 17 of 25 PFI schools with 12 
            traditionally funded schools and, in particular, notes that (a) the 
            quality of school buildings built via more traditional means was, 
            on average, better than early PFI schools, (b) there was criticism 
            by users of design aspects such as classroom lay-out and size, (c) 
            there was no clear-cut difference between traditional and PFI schools 
            on unit costs, (d) there were particular concerns regarding risk allocation, 
            for example vandalism was not a risk transferred to the provider although 
            risk management was often the key factor in tipping the balance in 
            favour of PFI, (e) if there was a major problem with a school building 
            the bottom line was that the local authority, bearing statutory responsibility 
            for education provision, had to step in if the PFI provider failed 
            to respond, (f) the report found no evidence that PFI schemes delivered 
            schools more quickly than more traditional methods and (g) the report 
            recommended a choice of procurement options; therefore challenges 
            the statements by the Minister for Finance and Public Services in 
            his letter to me on 20 January 2003 that &quot;the classic Public 
            Private Partnership (PPP) model has been tried and tested by authorities 
            in the market and has shown that it can attract competitive and efficient 
            bids and deliver good outputs&quot; and that PPP will deliver &quot;real 
            improvements to our school estate quickly and effectively&quot;, and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to halt the PFI/PPP programme in 
            the light of this and other critical reports. </p>

            voluntary and small business environmental projects by changes to 
            the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme; notes that the Business Environmental 
            Partnership has completed more than 600 environmental projects with 
            558 companies that have identified over £4.5 million annual cost savings 
            opportunities, over £10 million in new sales opportunities, helped 
            to safeguard 58 jobs in companies across the Lothians and assisted 
            25 businesses to achieve accreditation to IS0 14001 in environmental 
            management systems; further notes the huge contribution made to recycling 
            in Edinburgh by the Lothian and Edinburgh Environmental Partnership, 
            an organisation that also recycles the Parliament's paper, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency, enter 
            into consultation with all parties concerned, including HM Treasury 
            and Entrust.</p>

            that the Holocaust shook the foundations of modern civilisation and 
            that its unprecedented character and horror will always hold universal 
            meaning; condemns the evils of prejudice, discrimination and racism 
            and affirms the values of a free, tolerant, and democratic society; 
            believes that the Holocaust must have a permanent place in our nation's 
            collective memory; honours the survivors still with us and reaffirms 
            our commitment to the shared values of mutual understanding and justice; 
            encourages educators, policy-makers, elected representatives, church 
            and community leaders and parents to work together so that future 
            generations understand the causes of the Holocaust and reflect upon 
            its consequences and vows to remember the victims of Nazi persecution 
            and of all genocide; values the sacrifices of those who risked their 
            lives to protect or rescue victims, as a touchstone of the human capacity 
            for good in the face of evil; recognises that humanity is still scarred 
            by beliefs that nationality, race, religion, disability or sexuality 
            make some people's lives worth less than others and notes that genocide, 
            anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia and discrimination still continue 
            to scar humanity's conscience; pledges to work together against these 
            evils and to strengthen our efforts to promote education and research 
            about the Holocaust and other genocide to make sure that the lessons 
            of such events are fully learnt, and further encourages continuing 
            Holocaust remembrance by holding an annual UK Holocaust Memorial Day
