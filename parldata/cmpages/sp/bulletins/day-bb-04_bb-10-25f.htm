          <!-- #BeginEditable "Body text" -->
          <p><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1876</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>The Cullen Inquiry into the Dunblane Tragedy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the 100-year closure order which is currently in force on over 100 documents which formed part of the Cullen Inquiry into the Dunblane Tragedy; is further concerned to note that there is no statutory basis for this 100-year closure order and that, despite the Lord Advocate two years ago agreeing to release some of the papers, after editing to delete the names of children whose identity must be protected, no access to the documents has yet been allowed; notes that the documents covered by the 100-year closure order include police reports, plans of Dunblane Primary School and part of Thomas Hamilton&rsquo;s autopsy report; believes that the Cullen Inquiry left many questions unanswered, including allegations that Thomas Hamilton had access to the facilities at Queen Victoria School and associated with police officers and other well-known members of the community and the fact that there is a period prior to the tragedy when the whereabouts of Thomas Hamilton and who he met is unknown; further believes that the Cullen Inquiry made no serious effort to discover Thomas Hamilton&rsquo;s lifestyle and associates prior to the Dunblane Tragedy which might have shed some light on what drove him to commit such a dreadful act; believes that the Cullen Inquiry bears the hallmarks of a cover-up, and calls for a new inquiry, without a restrictive remit, to be set up without delay.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1875#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Energy Efficiency Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the commencement of Energy Efficiency Week between 25 and 31 October 2004, but notes that distribution of electricity to end-users in Scotland actually increased by 10% between 2000 and 2002; notes that this trend would prevent Scotland contributing the one million tonnes of carbon savings required as its fair contribution to the UK aspiration of 10 million tonnes of carbon savings from energy efficiency by 2010; notes that such savings can be achieved by methods such as improving the quality of the building stock, installing energy efficient equipment such as lighting and installing local clean or efficient energy sources and that these measures could have a beneficial impact upon endemic social problems such as fuel poverty; notes that, historically, specific regional figures pertaining to energy consumption have not been collated by bodies such as the Department of Trade and Industry, and calls on the Scottish Executive to collate and publish comprehensive Scottish energy statistics to underpin a comprehensive review of current energy efficiency strategy and aid the development of an evidence-based national energy efficiency strategy, ensuring that Scotland becomes a leader in energy efficiency.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1874</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>The Draft Maximum Number of Judges (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the draft Maximum Number of Judges (Scotland) Order 2004 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1873</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.12) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.12) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/447) be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1872</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (No.3) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (No.3) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/436) be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1871</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/435) be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1870</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Gender Segregation and Modern Apprenticeships</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report of phase one of the Equal Opportunities Commission&rsquo;s (EOC) investigation into gender segregation and modern apprenticeships in Scotland; is dismayed that, almost 30 years after the Sex Discrimination Act was passed, only 1.92% of engineering workers in Scotland are female and 4% of childcare workers are male; believes that skill shortages and high numbers of vacancies in construction, plumbing and engineering could be addressed through mainstreaming gender equality in the modern apprenticeships programme; further believes that, until low pay and low status are addressed and a coherent accredited training route is established, the childcare sector will continue to maintain a massive under-representation of male workers; notes that the EOC&rsquo;s findings indicate significant shortcomings associated with the statistical monitoring of modern apprenticeships and an apparent difference in perspectives on the objectives of modern apprenticeships between the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise; believes that until gender equality is mainstreamed into design, reporting and delivery, occupational segregation will continue to be a key feature of the modern apprenticeships programme, and considers that the Executive and Scottish Enterprise should develop a transparent national strategy to tackle gender segregation in skills generally and modern apprenticeships in particular, explicitly including gender targets to encourage non-stereotypical choices.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1869#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Scottish Air Ambulance Control Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the retention of the Scottish air ambulance control centre in Dundee; appreciates the professionalism of the current staff who between them have 184 years experience; recognises the comprehensive knowledge of Scotland&rsquo;s geography and the capabilities of the aircraft as well as their experience of the needs of patients and clinicians; further notes that the control centre in Dundee is also responsible for processing a large number of overspill calls from other ambulance control centres in Scotland; and therefore believes that any move to mothball the Dundee Air Desk would be a retrograde step which could compromise patient safety.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1868</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Deployment of British Troops in Iraq</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the United States Administration&rsquo;s request to send British troops into areas currently patrolled by American-led forces; is aware of the statement by the Secretary of State for Defence that he is inclined to comply; believes that such a move would significantly increase the danger to British troops in Iraq, and therefore calls for a vote in the House of Commons before Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government takes a final decision on this matter.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne, Mike Rumbles, Elaine Smith, Chris Ballance, John Swinburne, Campbell Martin, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Shona Robison<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1867</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>World Osteoporosis Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises World Osteoporosis Day on 20 October 2004; acknowledges that the consumption of carbonated drinks is a factor in the development of osteoporosis both for the calcium-leaching components of carbonated drinks and the reduced intake of milk associated with an increased intake of carbonated drinks; recognises the alarming occurrence in consumption of carbonated drinks among Scottish children who drink more fizzy drinks than any other country in Europe, and calls on the Scottish Executive to protect the bone health of future generations of Scottish citizens by banning the sale of carbonated drinks in schools.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Chris Ballance, Jim Mather, Fergus Ewing, Alex Neil, Carolyn Leckie, Frances Curran, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Bruce Crawford, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1866#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Knife Crime in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the spiralling growth of violent knife crime in Glasgow and the west of Scotland, affecting 7,500 people in the last year, has now reached epidemic proportions; considers that treatment of knife injuries necessitates the use of high levels of resources in our overstretched health service and that, if knife crime were a publicly notifiable disease, the Scottish Executive would have instigated a public inquiry into its causes, and therefore believes that an investigation into knife crime should be instigated as a matter of urgency, that there should be an increase in beat police officers and that sanctions should be increased against those who commit such crimes.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1865</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>White Poppies for Peace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the first white poppies for peace were conceived of by the Women&rsquo;s Co-operative Guild, many of whom were mothers, sisters, and widows of men killed in the First World War who feared that an even worse war was imminent, that white poppies first appeared on Armistice Day 1933 and that the Peace Pledge Union has subsequently undertaken their distribution; also notes that there have been 300 wars and 200 million war deaths since 1933; believes that the wearing of white poppies is a symbol of grief for everyone who has been harmed by war as well as a commitment to peace with justice, and therefore resolves to support the wearing of white poppies alongside red poppies during the period of remembrance.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1864</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Teaching of Scottish History</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament strongly supports the teaching of Scottish history in both primary and secondary schools in Scotland; believes that it is vital that our children are taught the history of their country and the contribution of its citizens to European and world culture and civilisation, and asserts that every child in Scotland should be taught Scottish history until at least the age of fourteen.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Swinburne, Stewart Stevenson, Robin Harper, Mr Bruce McFee, Christine Grahame, Rosie Kane, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Richard Lochhead, Chris Ballance, Mark Ballard, Margaret Mitchell, Fergus Ewing, Jim Mather, Alex Neil, Donald Gorrie, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1863</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Statement of Concern on Noise Pollution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes and endorses the Marine Connection statement of concern on noise pollution caused by military sonars; believes that trials and use of the S2087 low frequency active sonar contravenes Article 12 of the EU Habitats Directive, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement fully the directive in the sea areas for which it has responsibility.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1862</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Big Recycle Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Big Recycle Week, beginning on 18 October 2004; notes the extension of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s recycling target for local authorities from 25% by 2006 to 30% by 2008; congratulates the Executive on showing its commitment to increased recycling by extending this target, and urges the Executive to investigate, and report to the Parliament on, the potential of a zero waste policy for Scotland to further increase recycling and composting rates, minimise waste, increase efficiency, save natural resources, reduce energy use and pollution, create jobs, stimulate innovation and save Scotland money.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie, Chris Ballance, Robin Harper, Ms Sandra White, Mr Jamie Stone, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1861</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Air Pollution in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the mass support from the people of Scotland for a ban on smoking in public places due to their concerns about the danger that smoking causes to public health; further notes that recent research into levels of nitrogen oxides in the air has shown that breathing the air in Glasgow is the equivalent of smoking more than 14 cigarettes a day; is concerned that, even if the ban on smoking in public places is implemented, city-dwellers will still be exposed to dangerously high levels of pollutants caused by emissions from motor vehicles; calls upon all those who support a ban on smoking in public places to support all measures that would lessen the severe effects of road traffic on human health, and further calls on the Scottish Executive and Glasgow City Council to abandon their plans to build the M74 Northern Extension and invest the cost of the motorway, currently estimated at between &pound;375 million and &pound;1 billion, in traffic reduction measures and improvements to public transport.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Chris Ballance, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Mark Ballard, Shiona Baird, Rosie Kane, Robin Harper, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1860</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Inappropriate Historical Comments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments made by the historian, Dr David Starkey, that &quot;Scotland matters for a single reason, which is its involvement with England from the 17th century onwards. Then it becomes important&quot;; believes that these comments are ludicrous and misjudged, and notes the innumerable contributions the Scots have made to the world that all too often are ignored by Anglo-centric commentators in the UK media and celebrity &quot;so called&quot; historians.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Brian Adam, Christine Grahame, Chris Ballance, Alex Neil, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Bruce Crawford, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Jim Mather, Robin Harper, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1858</strong> <strong>Direct Payments</strong> (lodged on 15 October 2004) Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1857</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Proof-of-Age Cards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the wide range of age-restricted products that are available to consumers, including fireworks alcohol, cigarettes, spray paints, solvents, DVDs and computer games; notes that retailers need to check the age of individuals trying to buy these products when it is suspected that they are too young to legally do so; believes that a national proof-of-age scheme would help both retailers and young people, and, in the absence of such a scheme, calls on the Scottish Executive to carry out a national co-ordinated campaign to highlight the benefits of Scotland&rsquo;s young people carrying a PASS-accredited proof-of-age card when intending to buy age-restricted products.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1854.1</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Energy Efficiency Week 25 to 31 October 2004</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1854) in the name of Mike Pringle, insert at end &quot; and expresses astonishment that many office lights at Holyrood do not have switches provided and are therefore left on all night, and urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to address this waste of energy as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
