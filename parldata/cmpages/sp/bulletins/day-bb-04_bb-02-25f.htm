          <p><strong>*S2M-955</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>A 
            Recipe for Disaster</strong>-That the Parliament supports UNISON's 
            campaign to oppose EU plans for the privatisation of meat inspection: 
            shares its concerns for the safety of Scottish meat if these plans 
            go ahead: notes the recent report by the US Department of Agriculture 
            on the failure of the privatised Hazard Analysis Critical Control 
            Points System-based meat inspection system in the USA and the fact 
            that the EU wants to impose the same system on Scotland's meat hygiene 
            industry, and urges the Scottish Executive to oppose this privatisation 
            and fight to keep meat inspection in the hands of independent government 
            inspectors.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-954</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The 
            Viability of Care Commission Self-Funding</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the response on 2 February 2004 from the National Association 
            of Inspection and Registration Officers, the professional association 
            representing care commission officers working for the Scottish Commission 
            for the Regulation of Care, to the Scottish Executive consultation 
            paper on proposals for maximum fees to be levied by the Care Commission; 
            notes in particular that the response questions whether it is realistic 
            that the cost of regulation be covered by fee income generation and 
            that currently there is a significant shortfall between the cost of 
            regulation and fee income generation; notes that, if full cost is 
            implemented even incrementally as the Executive intends, the response 
            doubts whether the current level of regulation and protection for 
            service users can be sustained without making fees prohibitively expensive; 
            notes that to make ends meet it may be necessary to reduce the levels 
            of regulatory visits and workforce to meet available income, with 
            &quot;resulting consequences for the safeguarding of vulnerable service 
            users&quot;; refers to the answer to question S2W-4301 by Mr Tom McCabe 
            on 5 December 2003 stating that a financial and management policy 
            review of the Care Commission is not due until April 2007, and therefore, 
            in all these circumstances, and given the informed source of these 
            concerns and the increasing demands on the Commission, calls upon 
            the Executive to abandon the self-funding principle now.</P>

            face the loss of thousands of pounds over coming years; condemns the 
            universities' attempts to move towards a system of local pay bargaining; 
            notes the refusal of the universities to re-open negotiations with 
            the AUT on these issues; further notes that, whilst academic and related

          <p> <strong>*S2M-940</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Civil 
            Service Pay Dispute</strong>-That the Parliament notes last week's 
            industrial action in the civil service over pay; believes that starting 
            salaries in some parts of the civil service at £9,000 are unacceptably 
            low; further believes that thousands of civil servants suffer from 
            low pay and have to rely on state benefits to make ends meet; supports 
            the Public and Commercial Services Union in pursuit of its modest 
            demands, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do all that it can 
            to eradicate low pay from the civil service and to impress on Her 
            Majesty's Government the need to move towards a minimum wage set at 
            two-thirds of male median earnings as the starting point for pay scales 
            in the civil service.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-939#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Stop 
            Violence Against Women</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 8 March 
            2004 is International Women's Day; further notes that throughout the 
            world women and children continue to suffer from violence and abuse; 
            congratulates Amnesty International who on 5 March 2004 launch their 
            global &quot;Stop Violence Against Women&quot; campaign; notes that 
            in Scotland only a small percentage of domestic abuse incidents result 
            in successful prosecutions, and believes therefore that the Scottish 
            Executive should build on existing partnership work to ensure that 
            the justice system affords protection to victims and acts as a deterrent 
            to perpetrators.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-938#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Baywatch</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with dismay figures published by the Baywatch 
            campaign group that show that over 20% of disabled parking bays in 
            supermarket car parks are being used by non-disabled drivers; acknowledges 
            the frustration of disabled drivers when the store management appears 
            reluctant to enforce its own parking policy; appreciates that, for 
            their part, some store managers are not clear about their powers to 
            compel drivers to move from specially designated bays; notes that 
            this situation leaves supermarkets vulnerable to future legal action 
            under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended), and considers 
            that, if a satisfactory solution cannot be found, the possibility 
            of giving local authorities the appropriate enforcement powers should 
            be examined.</P>
