<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2542</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Clydebank Women&rsquo;s Aid Jog Group Complete the Great Scottish Run</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the group of women and workers from Clydebank Women&rsquo;s Aid who completed either the Great Scottish Run 10K or the half marathon on Sunday 7 September 2008; recognises that most of the women involved have been experiencing domestic abuse, living in a refuge or have recently escaped domestic abuse, and believes that this is testimony to their courage and provides further evidence of the strength and resilience of women.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2541</strong> <strong>Christopher Harvie:</strong> <strong>Carlyle Conference</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff of the University of Glasgow&rsquo;s Crichton Campus, in particular Drs Ralph Jessop and Carol Collins, on the successful organisation of the International Thomas Carlyle Conference from 4 to 7 September 2008; notes that with this conference, attended and addressed by academics and critics from Europe, the United States of America and Australia, a notable attempt was made to discuss and publicise the remarkable career of one of Scotland&rsquo;s greatest writers and thinkers, who was born in Ecclefechan in 1795 and died in Chelsea in 1881 and whose correspondents and disciples ranged from Goethe to Disraeli and Karl Marx to D. H. Lawrence; recognises that this event went far towards establishing the Crichton Campus as a centre for scholarship and teaching, serving the rich cultural landscape of Cumbria, Galloway and Ulster, and expresses hopes that it will be only the first in a series of such events.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2540</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Forth Valley College Boost</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Scottish Funding Council has awarded Forth Valley College &pound;30 million of funding to transform the facilities at the Forth Valley College sites in Falkirk, Stirling and Alloa; agrees with College Principal Linda McKay that &quot;These truly are exciting and transformational times for Forth Valley learners&quot;; acknowledges that this is a vote of confidence by the Scottish Funding Council in Forth Valley College, and wishes the staff and pupils well in the coming years in their new facilities.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2539#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Aircraft Noise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that increased protection is needed for communities directly under airport flight paths, such as Whitecrook, Linnvale and Drumry in Clydebank, which are affected by aircraft noise, a problem which also affects adjacent areas such as Drumchapel, Bearsden and Milngavie, and considers that there should be an examination of what fresh legislative or administrative steps might be taken to prevent any forced sale of Glasgow Airport leading to a worsening of noise pollution experienced by local residents.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2538</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Biggar Little Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the sixth Biggar Little Festival will take place between 16 and 22 October 2008 in and around Biggar, South Lanarkshire; believes that the festival is a wonderful celebration of arts and culture, bringing a range of live performances to communities outside of the major urban centres, and wishes everyone involved all the best for a successful festival this year and in years to come.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2537</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Mind the Gap - The Next Step</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report on disabled people&rsquo;s experiences of Scottish public transport, <em>Mind the Gap: The Next Step,</em> by Leonard Cheshire Disability; notes the findings that problems with transport create barriers to education, work and leisure, and that problems arise not only from physical inaccessibility but also from attitudes; further notes that these and other conclusions were also reached in Session 2 by the Equal Opportunities Committee in its report on its disability inquiry, <em>Removing Barriers and Creating Opportunities</em>; supports Leonard Cheshire Disability&rsquo;s call for a public awareness campaign and robust disability equality training for staff, and believes that the other recommendations made in <em>Removing Barriers and Creating Opportunities</em> should be built on and developed in this parliamentary session.</p>
