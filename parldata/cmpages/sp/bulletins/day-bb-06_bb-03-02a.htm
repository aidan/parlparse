<p align="center"><strong>Section A &ndash; Today&rsquo;s Business</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p>9.15 am&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish National Party Debate: Shirley McKie Case</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4039</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Shirley McKie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees with Lord McCluskey, retired High Court judge and former Solicitor General for Scotland, that one of the fundamental principles underlying the rule of law in a mature democracy is the principle that justice must be seen to be done; considers that in the case of Shirley McKie issues have arisen implying that justice has not been seen to be done, and, in further agreeing with Lord McCluskey that the issues involved are not party political but go to the heart of public trust in the criminal justice system, calls on the Scottish Executive to consider how the concerns expressed by Lord McCluskey should be addressed. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-4039.2</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Shirley McKie</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4039) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &quot;with&quot; to end and insert &quot;that action needs to be taken to restore public and professional confidence in the Scottish Fingerprint Service; acknowledges that in 2000 the SCRO Fingerprint Bureau was the subject of an independent inspection by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC); notes that following three further inspections HMIC reported that its 25 recommendations had been fully discharged; notes that further reforms are being taken forward; that the Minister for Justice has instructed the interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Police Services Authority to bring forward, by the end of March, a comprehensive action plan drawing on the best available international scientific advice and management expertise; notes that this action plan will be reported to the Parliament; believes that a public inquiry is not appropriate; notes that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to hold the Scottish Executive to account; welcomes the work already commenced by the Justice 1 Committee, and confirms the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to co-operate with any inquiries that the Parliament may decide to take forward in scrutinising these reforms.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-4039.1</strong> <strong>Colin Fox: Shirley McKie</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4039) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &quot;issues&quot; to end and insert &quot;the public is still not satisfied that the truth of the matter is all available; recognises that the McKie family campaign is not satisfied that there was no conspiracy against her; also recognises that the four Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) fingerprint workers are furious that their competence and reputation has been sullied; believes that the Scottish Executive has a duty to address all these concerns, and calls for a public inquiry to get to the truth of this matter and to restore public confidence in the SCRO and the fingerprint service as soon as possible.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish National Party Debate: Scottish Water</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4036</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, despite assurances from ministers that Scottish Water&rsquo;s investment plans were on target, the Chairman of Scottish Water has resigned due to disagreements with ministers and Scottish Water has been required to produce another business plan; considers that these events highlight poor stewardship of the water industry by the Scottish Executive; expresses its concern over the impact of delays in investment in water and sewerage infrastructure on economic, environmental and social development in Scotland, and calls on the Executive to set out promptly what impact these events will have on delivering the ministerial objectives for the water industry in Scotland. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-04036.2 Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD): </strong>As an amendment to motion S2M-04036 in the name of Rob Gibson (Scottish Water), leave out from &quot;,despite&quot; to end and insert &quot;Scottish Water&rsquo;s draft business plan of April 2005 stated that achieving Scottish Ministers' objectives for 2006 to 2010 would require a capital investment programme of &pound;3.7 billion and a doubling in customer charges; notes that the Water Industry Commission&rsquo;s determination of charges for 2006 to 2010 allowed Scottish Water a capital investment programme of &pound;2.1 billion and charges rising by less than the rate of inflation to achieve the objectives; notes that Scottish Water accepted the determination but its plan demonstrating how it would deliver the objectives within the limits set by the determination was judged by the Executive, supported by the regulators, not to meet the requirements in a number of material aspects; notes that the Executive has required Scottish Water to produce a new plan which will command the confidence of Ministers and regulators,and considers these actions by the Executive to represent good stewardship of Scottish Water in the public and customer interest.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-4036.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4036) in the name of Rob Gibson, leave out from &quot;and calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;further expresses concern that Scottish Water is failing to deliver an appropriate level of service to its customers; notes the concerns of the building community about Scottish Water&rsquo;s failure to allocate sufficient resources to remove development constraints; further notes the Executive&rsquo;s admission on 9 February 2005 that business customers have been overcharged &pound;44 million a year for water; further notes that the introduction of surface water drainage charges based on the size of the property are to be introduced into the denationalised English water market on 1 April 2006 which will lead to significantly lower charges for small businesses in England than in Scotland, thereby reinforcing the present competitive disadvantage faced by Scots firms; further notes the comments of former Environment Minister, Sam Galbraith, that &quot;We are slowly going broke and the only way to solve this is to reduce the public sector wage bill. Privatise water and, at a stroke, the bill is cut&quot; (<em>The Scotsman</em>, 10 February 2005); believes that as long as Scottish Water remains a bureaucratic, nationalised monopoly it will struggle to adopt the private sector disciplines expected by the Executive and the Water Industry Commission, and therefore calls on the Executive to take its commitment to make economic growth its top priority seriously by creating a genuine market in water and privatising Scottish Water or adopting a &quot;not for dividend&quot; model such as Welsh Water.&quot; </p>
