              is designated a World Heritage Site, and therefore considers that 
              the Scottish Executive should speedily propose discussions with 
              Her Majesty's Government to achieve the ultimate international acclaim 
              of World Heritage Status for this beautiful and environmentally 
              unique part of our heritage. </p>
