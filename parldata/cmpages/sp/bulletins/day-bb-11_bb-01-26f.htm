<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7793 Shona Robison: Dementia Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the progress being made by the NHS, local government, scrutiny bodies and partners in the voluntary and private sectors, including Alzheimer Scotland and the Scottish Dementia Working Group, in delivering the commitments set out in Scotland&rsquo;s first dementia strategy, building on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s establishment of dementia as a national priority and on the Parliament&rsquo;s Cross-Party Group on Alzheimer&rsquo;s <em>Charter of Rights for People with Dementia and their Carers in Scotland</em>, and further welcomes the Big Lottery Fund&rsquo;s investment in support for people with dementia and their carers after their diagnosis.</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7792 Bill Kidd: Independent Living Fund Suffers Westminster&rsquo;s Axe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern regarding the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to axe the Independent Living Fund, which enables disabled people to live on their own; notes that the fund has given more than &pound;60 million to help thousands of disabled people to live independently; further notes that thousands of people in Scotland have been aided by the fund; denounces the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to bar further applicants and remove funding to those already covered at the end of the current parliament, and condemns the UK Government&rsquo;s attack on those whom it considers to be the most vulnerable in society.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7791 Margaret Mitchell: Nicholas J Scullion &amp; Co School&rsquo;s Debating Cup</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lewis Archibald and Shannon Sartorious, pupils from Calderside Academy, Blantyre, on winning the Nicholas J Scullion &amp; Co School&rsquo;s Debating Cup; notes that six schools, with two pupils from each on a team, took part in the competition, which was part of South Lanarkshire Council&rsquo;s Determined to Succeed project; acknowledges that the competition also included the opportunity to take the pupils to Hamilton Sheriff Court to observe, listen and learn from live debates; further notes that this was the first time debating for many of the pupils, who were judged by members of the Glasgow University Debating Union and members of the local community; considers that this debating cup competition is an excellent example of a local business engaging with young people in the community, and hopes that the skills that the pupils have learnt from the competition will help them in the their studies and encourage them to continue debating.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7789 Bruce Crawford: Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees&mdash;</p>
<p>(a) the following revision to the programme of business for Wednesday 26 January&mdash;</p>
<p>delete</p>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
<p>and insert</p>
<p><strong>5.45 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
<p>(b) the following revision to the programme of business for Thursday 27 January&mdash;</p>
<p>after</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Financial Resolution: Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill</p>
<p>insert</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Government Debate: Dementia Strategy</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7788 Bill Wilson: Decriminalise the Chewing of Coca Leaves</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament urges the UK Government to support the Bolivian Government&rsquo;s proposed amendment to the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs that would decriminalise the practice of chewing coca leaves; notes that this practice has been a fundamental part of Bolivian culture for thousands of years and has deep religious significance among indigenous peoples; further notes that the ban on the chewing of coca leaves was based on a 1950 report based on evidence described by the Washington Office on Latin America and the Transnational Institute as unscientific and blatantly racist, and believes that this ban has had no effect on the processing of coca leaves to produce cocaine.</p>
<p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7787 Kenneth Gibson: Time to Ban Neonicotinoid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the continuing fall in the world&rsquo;s bee population and the wider impact that this is expected to have on the planet&rsquo;s ecosystem; is aware that bees are responsible for the pollination of around 90% of the plants grown; recognises the value of honeybees to the economy, estimated to have contributed approximately &pound;1 billion to the UK economy last year; understands that several scientific studies have pointed to the use of neonicotinoid insecticides as the primary cause of colony collapse disorder, which has so devastated the bee population; further understands that in the four countries that have recently implemented bans on this insecticide, France, Germany, Italy and Slovenia, there have been marked improvements in the bee population and a reversal of this steady and worrying decline, and calls on the European Union to pass legislation banning or at least limiting the use of what is considered this harmful insecticide before the bee population is irreversibly decimated.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7786 Robin Harper: Unemployment Services in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the news that the Scottish Government is planning to cut almost half of its budget for employment programmes in Edinburgh; notes that this would be in addition to the cuts already experienced by the City of Edinburgh Council; recognises that this funding, which historically has come to the Edinburgh Partnership, is used to support the Joined Up For Jobs strategy and to fund specialist programmes designed to fit the needs of local communities and priority groups; believes that the removal of these local services would impact greatly on those living in the most disadvantaged areas of the city and severely reduce the opportunities for unemployed young people and those who have experience of homelessness or addictions; recognises that, on 20 January 2011, members debated the need to provide opportunities for young people through establishing a microcredit scheme, and considers that such a scheme would greatly complement the retention of Edinburgh&rsquo;s existing unemployment services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7785 Kenneth Gibson: Voices and Images of Yesterday</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament would like to congratulate Donald Reid, Beith Christian Action Group, Barrmill Jolly Beggars, Beith Camera Club and all others who have contributed to and made possible the publishing of the new local history book, <em>Voices and Images of Yesterday and Today: Beith, Barmill &amp; Gateside: Precious Memories</em>, which will be launched in Beith Library on Thursday 27 January 2010; recognises the hard work, attention to detail and research over the past nine months that have culminated in this publication; acknowledges the importance of local history and literature in educating local schoolchildren and considers them an invaluable source of the rich heritage of family and social history of an area; welcomes the fact that the proceeds from book sales will be used to fund what are considered many worthy local causes, including Barrmill Community Association, the Beith branch of the Ayrshire Cancer Support Group and Barrmill Lads &amp; Lassies Burns Club, and wishes everyone involved with the book launch a highly enjoyable evening and great success in their bid to raise money for the aforementioned causes.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7784 Kenneth Gibson: Irvine&rsquo;s Bakers, World Scotch Pie Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Maurice Irvine and all of the staff at Irvine&rsquo;s Bakery on winning this year&rsquo;s Scotch Pie World Championship; applauds Mr Irvine&rsquo;s perseverance, having finished in second, third and fourth place over a period of 11 years; recognises the contribution of Irvine&rsquo;s bakery to the local community and economy, with three shops, a production unit and a caf&eacute; all located in the Garnock Valley and employing 45 people; further recognises the traditions and longevity of Irvine&rsquo;s Bakery, which was founded by Maurice&rsquo;s great-grandfather, Thomas, in the 1920s; believes that this award will come as a welcome boost to the business as people travel from around the country to sample the best Scotch pie in the world, and wishes Mr Irvine and his staff continued success in years ahead.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Bob Doris<strong>*</strong>, Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7783 Cathy Peattie: Central FM</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Central FM on beingchosen as the top small Scottish radio station in theprestigious Sony Radio Awards; considers that the station provides excellent news coverage and a high standard of entertainment andshows a commitment tolocal communities, and wishes the station success in the UK finals of this category, which isfor stations with an adult listenership of under 300,000.</p>
