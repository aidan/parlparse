          <P><strong>*S2M-328</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>"The

            of &quot;The Place&quot;, the Glenrothes Youth and Health and Advice 
            Service for 12 to 25 year olds; congratulates the young people of 
            Glenrothes and its high schools who have worked with NHS Fife and 
            Fife Council to develop the service, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to look at &quot;The Place&quot; and encourage other towns to provide

          <P><strong>*S2M-327#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Fiscal 
            Autonomy</strong>-That the Parliament notes that a majority of Scots 
            believe that the Scottish Parliament should have increased powers; 
            recognises that devolution is a dynamic process and therefore calls 
            for dialogue amongst the political parties within the Parliament with 
            regard to securing additional powers, particularly fiscal autonomy, 
            and further recognises that such powers would enable the Parliament 
            to use the resources of Scotland to fully address the social and economic 
            problems facing senior citizens and other excluded members of Scottish 
            society.</P>

            industry to safely and efficiently transport abnormal loads on Scotland's 
            road network; notes the present difficulties being experienced by 
            the industry in relation to the operation of police escorts for HGVs 
            carrying abnormal loads; believes that the use of private escorting 
            services which operate in parts of England would improve the efficiency 
            of the haulage industry and reduce the burden on our police force, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should facilitate this in 
            consultation with chief constables, police boards and Her Majesty's 
            Government.</P>

            expresses grave concern about the recent revelations of the early 
            knowledge of contamination of blood products administered to patients 
            suffering from haemophilia; notes that minutes of meetings indicate 
            that professionals were aware of problems related to commercial American 
            supplies as early as 1974; further notes that this information was 
            not disclosed to patients at the time or to the Parliament since, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure justice, openness

            to this day and that, despite various undertakings by Ministers to 
            issue a consultation document on the future of court services in Peebles, 
            no consultation has taken place to date; further notes that the retention 
            of the sheriff court at Peebles is supported by, among others, the 
            Sheriff Principal of Lothian and Borders and the two sheriffs who 
            sit there, the Society of Solicitors in the Shires of Selkirk and 
            Peebles, the Faculty of Solicitors in Roxburghshire, the Citizens 
            Advice Bureau Peebles and the Lord Lieutenant of Tweeddale, and therefore

            with no fewer than eight bodies currently overseeing it, and further 
            regrets that the Executive has failed to make meaningful financial 
            provision to the industry in terms of research and development, especially 
            of new species, failed to protect the quality &quot;Scottish&quot; 
            brand for farmed salmon and failed to safeguard the 6,500 Scottish 
            jobs in salmon farming by its inadequate approach to dumping of inferior 
            foreign product on the European market with the subsequent collapse 
            in Scottish prices."</P>

            the sector's vital economic contribution to Scotland; urges the industry 
            to strive continually to achieve the highest environmental standards 
            and welcomes progress already made; believes that the regulatory framework

            must be learnt from other countries on the streamlining and simplification 
            of the regulatory framework and is disappointed that this is one of 
            many issues that the strategy fails to address adequately; calls for 
            the powers currently exercised by the Crown Estate to be transferred 
            to the Parliament, and further calls for the early introduction of 
            legislation transferring planning control to local authorities in 
            order to enhance openness and accountability to ensure that local 
            communities have a say over the siting of fish farms. "</P>
