            the Presiding Officer, as Chair of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
            Body, make an accurate statement to the Parliament on the expected 
            completion date, entry date, estimated cost of the new Parliament

            and West Fife Advertiser and Scottish Local Newspaper of the Year 
            Award 2002</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>Dunfermline 
            Press and West Fife Advertiser</em> on winning the Scottish Local 
            Newspaper of the Year Award 2002; recognises the massive contribution 
            that the paper makes to the life of the community in west Fife, and 
            acknowledges the vital role of local newspapers throughout Scotland 
            in providing news and a voice that is sensitive to local concerns.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3008</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie: Dunfermline Press 
            and West Fife Advertiser</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            the <em>Dunfermline Press and West Fife Advertiser</em> on winning 
            the Scottish Local Newspaper of the Year Award 2002; believes that 
            the newspaper has played a valuable role in Dunfermline and west Fife 
            over the past year; looks forward to another year of excellent service, 
            and hopes that it will continue to be Fife&#146;s best selling weekly 
            for many more years to come.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3007</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell: Anti-social Behaviour 
            Orders</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes that anti-social 
            behaviour orders are not working effectively and that many social 
            housing providers are having difficulty implementing policies and 
            procedures to deal speedily with tenants&#146; complaints and, in 
            order to meet the needs of complainants, calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to take urgent action at the earliest possible opportunity to deal 
            with anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3006</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Perthshire Gardens 
            Collection</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the establishment 
            of the Perthshire Gardens Collection; congratulates all of the nine 
            gardens involved in this new initiative on developing this innovative 
            approach to marketing these gardens as attractions and as an excellent 
            means of promoting Perthshire as a short break tourist destination, 
            and wishes them a successful season.</p>

            Club, its players, management, board of directors and loyal fans, 
            for their success in securing promotion to the Scottish First Division, 
            a feat which has escaped them for the last 16 years; is certain that 
            this achievement will help to secure the club&#146;s future; looks 
            forward to further success for the club, and commends the contribution 
            made by the manager, John Connolly, who has in two years transformed 
            a football club in financial difficulty and facing relegation into 
            one which is now on the way up and which also has continued ambition 
            to go on climbing</a>.</p>
