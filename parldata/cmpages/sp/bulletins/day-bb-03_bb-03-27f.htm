          <p><strong>*S1M-4070</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Scottish Settlement 
            for Fire Dispute</strong>-That the Parliament notes the decision of 
            Her Majesty's Government to introduce a Fire Services Bill that will 
            impose a pay and conditions settlement on fire services staff in England 
            and Wales; recognises that by this action Her Majesty's Government 
            has effectively abandoned the United Kingdom negotiating mechanism, 
            and calls upon the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the 
            Fire Brigades Union in Scotland to enter into negotiations to secure 
            a fair and just settlement that can be presented to the incoming Scottish 
            Executive.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4069</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Chapelcross - The 
            World's Oldest Operational Nuclear Power Station</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes that the Chapelcross Power Station will, from the 
            start of April, be the longest serving nuclear power station in the 
            world; further notes that Chapelcross has provided a safe and reliable 
            supply of electricity to the south of Scotland since 1959 and regrets 
            that it will cease generation no later than 31 March 2005; believes 
            that the engineering and scientific accomplishments of designing, 
            building and operating Chapelcross and Calder Hall were the 20th century 
            equivalent of the Forth Rail Bridge or the invention of the steam 
            engine and congratulates the management and workforce on their skill 
            and dedication in operating successfully the Calder Hall and Chapelcross 
            power stations for a combined total of more than 90 years; further 
            notes the fudge and delay inherent in the Government's energy white 
            paper, and believes that the success of Chapelcross would be best 
            recognised by the early commissioning of a replacement nuclear power 
            facility on the same site.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-4068</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Paisley Law 
            Centre</strong>-That the Parliament commends the hard work of the 
            staff of the Paisley Law Centre, notes that at the end of December, 
            Paisley Law Centre was carrying a caseload of 489 open client files; 
            further notes that 47% of its client caseload during this period was 
            people facing eviction, 22% was involved in other miscellaneous house 
            disputes, 17% related to social security, mental health, community 
            care, criminal injuries and disability matters, 7% was involved in 
            disputes involving their employment and 5% related to assisting voluntary 
            organisations; believes that Paisley Law Centre offers a quality service 
            giving clients a high chance of achieving a successful resolution 
            to their problem and significantly helps in preventing homelessness 
            and tackling social exclusion and that many of its clients have children 
            living with them in their tenancies or are vulnerable due to ill health 
            or other reasons and a significant number would no doubt have been 
            evicted had they had no representation; supports the work of local 
            law centres, which provide such essential services to our communities, 
            and urges support for their development across Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4067</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Paisley, Scotlands 
            Largest Fairtrade town</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Fairtrade 
            Fortnight 2003 from 3 to 17<sup> </sup>March 2003 was widely observed 
            in Scotland and welcomes the growing support for this annual observance; 
            congratulates the town of Paisley on meeting the five criteria laid 
            down by the Fairtrade Foundation for the holding of Fairtrade town 
            status, understanding that the five tests successfully met by Paisley 
            are a resolution from the local council supporting Fairtrade and an 
            agreement to serve Fairtrade coffee and tea at its meetings, in its 
            offices and canteens, a range of Fairtrade products readily available 
            in the area's shops and served in at least two local cafes, Fairtrade 
            products in use by at least 10 local businesses and organisations 
            including churches, media coverage and popular support and a local 
            Fairtrade steering group to ensure continued commitment to the Fairtrade 
            town status ideal; recognises that this status will establish Paisley 
            as the largest Fairtrade town in Scotland and acknowledges with appreciation 
            the work Renfrewshire Council, the ecumenical effort of the churches 
            in the area, the support of local newspapers and local radio stations, 
            the willingness of many Paisley people to make fair trade a priority 
            and the campaigning of local politicians to this end; believes that 
            Fairtrade products have a key role in raising awareness of significant 
            global issues among consumers and their families, and encourages other 
            towns to follow where Paisley leads.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-4066</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: Dr Winnie Ewing 
            MSP</strong>-That the Parliament notes with great respect and affection 
            the work of Dr Winnie Ewing in the Parliaments of Scotland, Westminster 
            and Europe; recognises her unstinting work on behalf of all the peoples 
            of Scotland; recalls the dignity with which she opened the first Scottish 
            Parliament in 1999, and wishes her every happiness in her retirement 
            from public life, but anticipates that she will not relent from her 
            tireless path to advance Scotland's cause in the international community 
            of nations.</p>

          <p><strong>*S1M-4065</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Parliament 
            Staff</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its respect for, and 
            pride in, the staff of the Parliament who have been an example of 
            shining endeavour to all in making the Parliament work; is mindful 
            that they, more than politicians, created the Parliament from scratch 
            and adopted an upbeat and helpful attitude that is not present to 
            such a degree in all Parliaments; notes that the staff undertook two 
            big "flits", to Glasgow and to Aberdeen, the burden of which was borne 
            with grace; believes that every single office, clerking, Official 
            Report, the office of the Clerk and the Presiding Officer, the post 
            office, external relations, media, participation services, procurement, 
            facilities management, allowances and finance, personnel, broadcasting, 
            lawyers, IT and information services, reception desk, SPICe, security 
            staff and police and all others, including the restaurant staff and 
            the cleaners who kept things sparkling, deserves recognition and further 
            believes that the staff set an example of public service that elected 
            members must try to live up to.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4064.1</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Closing the 
            Opportunity Gap for Older People</strong>-As an amendment to motion 
            (S1M-4064) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;by&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;but notes that its policies are not working, 
            care homes are having to close due to a funding crisis, waiting lists 
            and times are rising, more older people feel insecure in their homes 
            and there is an insufficient level of provision of appropriate housing 
            for older people and considers that, if the Chancellor was to abolish 
            his punitive stealth tax on pension funds in the forthcoming budget, 
            the opportunity gap for older people would be greatly reduced.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4064.2</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Closing the 
            Opportunity Gap for Older People</strong>-As an amendment to motion 
            (S1M-4064) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "welcomes" 
            to end and insert "notes that life expectancy in Scotland is among 
            the lowest in the developed world; further notes that Scottish Executive 
            health targets entrench age inequalities; accepts that ageism is a 
            reality in modern Scotland and must be countered; is aware that 25% 
            of Scottish pensioners live in poverty; acknowledges that more coherence 
            to the concessionary fare scheme is required; seeks more flexibility 
            in delivering the central heating programme; desires that the postcode 
            lottery of free personal care places be ended; recognises that older 
            people have a vital part to play in our democracy; is concerned at 
            continuing reductions in the value of the state pension in real and 
            relative terms; demands that the closure of final salary scheme pensions 
            be addressed to prevent future generations of older people being left 
            with low incomes, financial insecurity and dependent on means-tested 
            benefits, and believes that to address the needs of older people in 
            Scotland the Parliament needs the full powers of an independent sovereign 
            state." </p>

            reduce pension age to 60 and restore the link to earnings, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to adopt a Senior Citizens' Charter that 
            should include the following; abolition of rents for all pensioners 
            in public rented accommodation, including sheltered housing, purchase 
            of fuel vouchers to provide free fuel for pensioners between October 
            and April and vouchers for free telephone installation and standing 
            charges, purchase of TV licences for all pensioners and the provision
