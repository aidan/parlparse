            particularly youth crime; notes that such officers are often the most 
            visible and recognisable police presence in their communities and 
            recognises the crucial role that they play in providing high quality 
            policing and fostering links with the communities they serve; regrets 
            that these officers are often removed from their vital community role 
            to perform other police duties, and therefore believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should encourage community policing and provide the necessary 
            resources to ensure the provision of adequate numbers of community 
            police officers. </p>

            the initiative of Glasgow City, Argyll and Bute, Dundee City, Inverclyde, 
            Midlothian and West Dunbartonshire councils in commissioning a special 
            report from Professor Arthur Midwinter, <em>Grant Distribution and 
            the Mismatch Effect: An Assessment of its Impact on Council since 
            Reorganisation</em>, which concludes that there is &quot;clear evidence 
            of the erosion of grant income&quot; between 1996-97 and 2001-02 in 
            these local authority areas; acknowledges the report&#146;s view that 
            the flawed reorganisation of local government ordered by the last 
            Conservative government is the root cause of a situation where, in 
            these six local authority areas in the period, government grants fell 
            by 4.8% in real terms compared to an average drop of 1.2% across Scotland&#146;s 
            councils and council tax rose by 20% in real terms compared to an 
            average of 16%, and believes that the Scottish Executive should seriously 
            consider accepting the central recommendation of the report, namely 
            that it should provide a supplementary grant of £50 million to redress 
            this historical mismatch of funding: £32 million to Glasgow, £5 million 
            to Dundee, £3.4 million each to Midlothian and Argyll and Bute and
