<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00353 Bob Doris: Maryhill CAB&rsquo;s 30th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Maryhill Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) on its 30th anniversary; recognises what it considers to be the enormous contribution of its staff and volunteers since 1981; notes that this has included dealing with over 420,000 enquiries, representing clients at over 2,000 welfare rights and employment tribunals and obtaining over &pound;19.5 million in financial gains for clients; considers that Maryhill CAB&rsquo;s role in the local community is becoming increasingly important; notes, as evidence of this, that 2010-11 has been its busiest year to date, and wishes Maryhill CAB many more successful years to come.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christina McKelvie*, Kevin Stewart*, Jean Urquhart*, Ruth Davidson*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00352 Jamie McGrigor: Reversal of Forfeitures Affecting Descendants of Those who Supported the Royal House of Stuart</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is aware of the current petition being collected to permit legislation to be introduced in the UK Parliament reversing forfeitures and attainders still in existence affecting those whose ancestors supported the Royal Stuarts; notes that these Jacobites lost civil rights and property and were tainted with the label of &quot;corruption of blood&quot;; further notes that this included all ranks from peers and lairds to clerks in government offices, including such well-known figures as Rob Roy and Flora MacDonald, and believes that such a repeal might appropriately take place in 2012 to coincide with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Diamond Jubilee.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christina McKelvie*, Mike MacKenzie*, Liz Smith*, Nanette Milne*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00351 Humza Yousaf: Action on Hearing Loss Centenary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Action on Hearing Loss, formerly RNID, on its centenary; recognises the work that the charity has done over the years on biomedical research, products and technology, services, information and outreach and campaigning; notes that one in seven people in Scotland are deaf or hard of hearing and will continue to need vital services from audiology to social care, lipreading classes to local support groups; further notes that, with an ageing population, the number of people with hearing loss is set to increase, and wishes Action on Hearing Loss every success for the next 100 years as it works to create a world where hearing loss does not limit or label people, where tinnitus is silenced and where people value their hearing enough to look after it.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christina McKelvie*, Bill Kidd*, Marco Biagi*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Kenneth Gibson*, John Finnie*, Mike MacKenzie*, Nanette Milne*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00350 Elaine Smith: National Breastfeeding Awareness Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises National Breastfeeding Awareness Week, which takes place from 19 to 25 June 2011 with events being held across Lanarkshire; believes National Breastfeeding Awareness week to be an important tool in raising awareness of, and support for, breastfeeding; notes that the breastfeeding support group mothers and babies from Coatbridge will meet at Mackinnon Mills on Wednesday 22 June to hand out leaflets to promote breastfeeding; welcomes recent statistics from NHS Lanarkshire that show an increasing trend in breastfeeding rates at birth and discharge, however is concerned that this has failed to translate into an increase in sustained breastfeeding rates at six to eight weeks; considers this increase at birth to be testament to the success of the breastfeeding support teams, and would welcome further government funding in order to extend the scheme.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kevin Stewart*, Jackie Baillie*, Mike MacKenzie*, Patrick Harvie*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00349 Patricia Ferguson: Awards Triumph for Maryhill Housing Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Maryhill Housing Association on winning the Apartment of the Year prize at the Scottish Home Awards 2011; notes that this is in recognition of its &pound;4.6 million redevelopment of the former Maryhill Primary School; commends the association for the transformation of this C listed building in order to retain its original structure while providing new homes for the local community, and applauds all those involved in delivering this award-winning development.</p>
