<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Government Debate: Progress Towards 18 Week Referral to Treatment&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-6393 Nicola Sturgeon: Progress Towards 18 Week Referral to Treatment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the progress that has been made in reducing waiting times for patients; applauds the commitment, dedication and hard work of all NHS staff who have contributed to delivering significant improvements for the people of Scotland, and acknowledges that NHSScotland is on track to deliver the Scottish Government&rsquo;s challenging whole-journey waiting time target of 18 weeks by the end 2011. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-6393.3 Jackie Baillie: Progress Towards 18 Week Referral to Treatment</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6393) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;; welcomes the progress made by the previous Labour/ Liberal Democrat administration in setting a new approach in <em>Fair to All Personal to Each</em> whereby waiting is considered in terms of the overall patient journey and further welcomes the commitment to treat inpatients within 18 weeks being achieved a year ahead of schedule, paving the way for Labour and SNP 2007 manifesto commitments of an 18-week referral to treatment target, and notes that this compares with a waiting time target of 18 months set by the last Conservative administration.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-6393.1 Murdo Fraser: Progress Towards 18 Week Referral to Treatment</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6393) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;, and urges the Scottish Government to ensure that such progress is not compromised by either reductions in its budget or by efficiency savings within NHS boards.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-6393.2 Ross Finnie: Progress Towards 18 Week Referral to Treatment</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6393) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;, believes that the achievement of the 18-week Referral to Treatment standard must not be at the expense of patients waiting to access services not covered by the guarantee or patients waiting for follow-up appointments; recognises that clinical need and patient care should always take precedence over fulfilling political targets, and therefore considers that the achievement of maximum waiting times should ultimately be at the discretion of clinicians.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-6299 Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell: Employment and Support Allowance, Unfit for Purpose</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the workings of the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA); notes evidence from the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) Service in Scotland that uncovers serious hardship experienced by ESA claimants across Scotland; considers that sickness benefits should support people in finding employment if they are able to work, but must also provide help for those who are not; considers that ESA is failing to find this balance and is putting pressure on sick and disabled people in Scotland; notes in particular claims that the work capability assessment of ESA is making unsuitable decisions on claimants&rsquo; fitness for work and that 70% of CAB appeals against these decisions are being upheld, and would welcome a review of ESA aimed at making it work in the interests of the genuinely sick and disabled people of Central Scotland and the rest of the country.</p>
