          <p><strong>*S2M-820</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Alternative 
            MMR Vaccine Research</strong>-That the Parliament commends the Irish 
            Government and the Science Foundation of Ireland for awarding a £482,000 
            grant to fund research by Professor Greg Atkins of Trinity College, 
            Dublin, into the development of a new synthetic alternative to MMR; 
            believes that the Irish Government has shown foresight and helped 
            move the debate on vaccination policy forward everywhere by recognising 
            that a causal link between MMR and children having autism and bowel 
            disease has neither been confirmed or refuted; further believes that 
            compatible research should be funded in Scotland and that, in the 
            meantime, single vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella should be 
            made available to all parents as well as MMR, and believes that this 
            would improve confidence in vaccination policy and increase uptake 
            to levels more likely to ensure herd immunity.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-819</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Definition 
            of Domestic Abuse</strong>-That the Parliament calls upon that the 
            multi-agency Scottish Partnership on Domestic Abuse, while continuing 
            its efforts to campaign against abuse by a partner, to widen the definition 
            of domestic abuse to cover all abuse among the members of a household.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-818</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Retrospective 
            Graduate Tax</strong>-That the Parliament condemns, given the current 
            uncertainty over the funding of higher education, the response by 
            some alumni who expect today's higher education students to incur 
            significant debt to pay for a privilege that they received at no direct 
            cost to themselves, upfront or thereafter and who, in addition, received 
            adequate financial assistance at the expense of the general taxpayer, 
            and therefore believes it is incumbent on the Scottish Executive to 
            ensure that any future review of higher education funding guarantees 
            that everyone who has benefited from a university education contributes 
            fairly to it through a retrospective but progressive graduate tax.</P>
