<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions  and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on  which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments  lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin  every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains  any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the  Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (u).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked  with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3371 Bill Butler: The  Deportation of Drumchapel High School Pupils&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament expresses  its deep regret at the deportation of Drumchapel High School pupils, Nimet and  Saida Vucaj, on Thursday 29 September 2005 to Kosovo from London Stansted  Airport following the rejection of their family&rsquo;s asylum application;  deprecates the insensitive manner in which immigration officials apparently  handled this part of the process; expresses its sympathy for the pupils and  staff of Drumchapel High School whose feelings of anger and dismay at this  appalling news regarding what has happened to their friends and fellow pupils  can scarcely be imagined; acknowledges the First Minister&rsquo;s commitment,  expressed in the Parliament on 22 September 2005, to initiate discussions with  the Home Office to agree a protocol which will cover all removals of children  and young people in Scotland, and exhorts the Scottish Executive as a matter of  urgency, given this recent distressing case, to expedite the formulation of  such a protocol with Westminster and negotiate a moratorium on any further such  dawn raids until such a protocol has been agreed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christine  Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Susan Deacon<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Dr  Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3370 Michael McMahon: Scottish  Executive/Home Office Protocol on the Removal of Asylum Seekers from Detention  in Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that, while asylum is a matter  reserved to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government, the Scottish Executive has  responsibilities in respect of the welfare of children; welcomes the  acknowledgement from the First Minister that we must take a responsible  approach to these important matters; notes the positive impact children of  asylum seekers have in enhancing the cultural diversity of Scotland&rsquo;s schools,  and the effect of removal of those children on classmates left behind;  recognises the need to establish a protocol with the Home Office on the way  that failed asylum seeker families are removed from detention in Scotland;  requests that responsible departments within the Executive discuss with the  Home Office an appropriate role in planning for deportations involving  children, and further requests that discussions take place between immigration  officials and local officials responsible for child welfare, in order to ensure  that the dignity of, and respect for, all persons is upheld.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3369 Michael McMahon: Hamilton  Academical Football Club&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates Hamilton  Academical Football Club for winning a place in the final of the Bells  Challenge Cup against St Mirren, to be held at New Broomfield on Sunday 6  November 2005; notes that this means a great deal to the fans of the club,  coming as it does after a long struggle back to the top divisions of Scottish  football; encourages the entire town and people of South Lanarkshire to get  behind the team, and urges as many people from the town as possible to go along  to the match.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3368 Mr Mark Ruskell: Climate Change Emissions Figures&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament considers that  the apparent reduction in greenhouse gas pollution since 1990, from 5.7% last  year to 10.1% this year, as announced by the Scottish Executive during the  Environment and Rural Development Committee debate on its inquiry report on  climate change, was because of a change in the way the emissions were  calculated and not because of any reduction in emissions last year; notes,  indeed, that there was no reduction in Scotland&rsquo;s carbon dioxide emissions and  that there was a less than 0.5% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions in  the last year, and calls on the Executive to act on the recommendations of the  Environment and Rural Development Committee&rsquo;s 5th Report, 2005 (Session 2):<em> Report on Inquiry into Climate Change</em>.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3367 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Pesticide Safety&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament  notes the recent publication of <em>Crop  Spraying and the Health of Residents and Bystanders</em> by the Royal Commission  on Environmental Pollution, which highlighted the potentially damaging effects  of pesticides on our health; recognises the potential conflicts of interest  within the current system and the need to revise the way the Pesticides Safety  Directorate operates, and calls on the Scottish Executive to institute a  fundamental overhaul of the risk assessment of pesticides, a monitoring  programme for health and exposure that will determine the real scale of the  problem, a mandatory right for the public to be notified of which pesticides  are being used, both in advance and with on-site signage, and to introduce  buffer no-spray zones as a precautionary measure.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3366 Mr Brian Monteith: Scottish Poetry Library&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament notes the success of the Scottish Poetry Library&rsquo;s Poet in Public  poetry and architecture competition which saw around 1,000 poems entered from  schools across Scotland; congratulates students S1 to S3 category winner,  Marcus Kernohan from Skye&rsquo;s Portree High School, for his poem on the Scott  Monument and pupils P3 to P7 winner, Amy Green from Dean Park Primary School,  Balerno, for &ldquo;The Brewery&rsquo;s Friends&rdquo;, a poem on the Scottish Parliament;  further congratulates the Scottish Poetry Library on its efforts in engaging  the public in poetry and in recognising the role which poetry can play in  developing creative skills in younger people, and hopes that next year&rsquo;s Poet  in the Past 2006 competition, supported by Edinburgh World Heritage Trust, the  Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, the  Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland and Historic Scotland, will be as  great a success in encouraging today&rsquo;s younger people to become tomorrow&rsquo;s  Scottish poets.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3365 Dr Jean Turner: Provision of Papers in Alternative Formats to Print&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament wishes to recognise the work being done by the Scottish Executive in  including blind and partially-sighted people in its consultation processes by  transcribing print to both Braille and audio formats and commends the role of  Cue and Review Recording Services in this process; acknowledges the important  role that Executive funding has played in developing Cue and Review&rsquo;s website  which includes an automated quote tool; recognises, however, that provision of  material in audio, Braille and large print formats is insufficient unless it  publicises that this information is available in these formats, and calls on  the Executive to ensure that all future publicity carries this information to  encourage blind and partially-sighted people to ask for consultation papers in  their preferred format.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3362 Robin Harper: NICE Report on Drug Treatments for Children&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates  the British Psychological Society&rsquo;s (BPS) Faculty for Children and Young People  on its successful conference on child psychology held in Edinburgh on 15 and 16  September 2005; notes, in relation to this conference, the conclusions of the  National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) report published on 28  September 2005 in relation to the provision of drug treatments to young  children suffering from depression, conclusions that clearly recommend  maximising of the benefits of using the skills of clinical psychologists before  using drugs, however safe and effective these treatments may be, and calls on  the Scottish Executive to make the necessary resources available to the NHS in  order to implement such a change in health policy, in the interests of the  mental health of all young people, and to take note of other conclusions from  the September BPS conference, especially in relation to early recognition of,  and pre-emptive treatments for, children who are likely to develop mental  health problems, ensuring that the principles outlined in the National Framework  for Children and Young People&rsquo;s Mental Health, due to be launched in October,  are consistent with this and that efforts to improve and expand the workforce  so as to deliver appropriate psychological interventions early on in the  problem cycle are resourced adequately.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3360 Dr Sylvia Jackson: Free Use of MECS in Stirling&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament notes the inaccuracy and misinformation in motion S2M-3251 by Brian  Monteith regarding the decision of Stirling Council to introduce an annual  charge of &pound;52 for use of the Mobile Emergency Care System (MECS) as community  alarms do not fall within the definition of free personal and nursing care as  set out in section 2(28) of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 and  congratulates Stirling Council on its provision of a free MECS service to all  of its most vulnerable residents, while also recognising that the additional  provision of this community alarm service makes a valuable contribution to the  quality of life for those less vulnerable residents and their families who can  use MECS at a nominal cost.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3359 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Dr Jeffrey Wigand - &ldquo;The Insider&rdquo;&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament welcomes the visit of the internationally renowned anti-smoking  campaigner, Dr Jeffrey Wigand, to Scotland; applauds his bravery in deciding to  expose the lies and deceit of the tobacco industry despite threats against him;  supports his comments on the need to continue the battle against the tobacco  industry; thanks him for his support of the Parliament&rsquo;s decision to ban  smoking in public places in Scotland; is concerned by the fact that  approximately one-third of fire deaths in Scotland are caused by cigarettes,  and agrees with him that Scotland should follow the example of Canada, New York  and Vermont by legislating to make all cigarettes sold in Scotland &ldquo;fire-safe&rdquo;  in order to reduce the fire deaths, injuries and damage to property that are  caused by cigarettes.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3357 Michael Matheson: Campaign for a Scottish Olympic Team&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes  the launch of the Campaign for a Scottish Olympic Team; notes that an  overwhelming majority of Scots, 78%, would like to see Scotland send its own  Olympic team to London in 2012 which would act as a catalyst to inspire many  young Scottish athletes to represent their nation and pursue sporting excellence;  recognises the fact that there is no technical reason why Scotland cannot have  its own Olympic team, and calls on politicians from across the political  spectrum to get behind the Scottish Olympic Team campaign.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3355# Maureen Macmillan: Drink Driving in the Highlands&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament notes with concern the continued high incidence of drink driving  offences in the Northern Constabulary area and, in particular, the substantial  increase in the statistics for driving while unfit through drink or drugs;  notes that in one recent 19-day period there were 19 arrests for drink driving  in the Ross, Cromarty and Skye Command area alone; further notes that the  profile of drink drivers tends to be middle-aged rather than young, and  believes that the Scottish Executive should consider how it can better  reinforce the message that drink driving is a criminal offence which can result  in severe injury and loss of life.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3354 John Swinburne: Winter-Related Deaths&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with great concern  that experts are forecasting an extremely severe winter; agrees that free  central heating is a very laudable flagship policy but notes that, sadly, it is  not being delivered at the point of need, as borne out by the fact that over  8,000 senior citizens in Scotland have succumbed to winter-related deaths in  the last three winters and, for example in Glasgow, where one-in-36 senior  citizens are at risk of dying of cold-related deaths, that, out of 3,297  applications for free central heating, 65% of applications have been rejected  and only 1,177 systems installed; notes that this is either due to too high  criteria being applied to these applications or perhaps too much red tape,  resulting in refusals for the installation of new central heating systems, and  further notes that, if this 65% rejection rate is replicated across the  country, the deplorable record of deaths due to winter-related cold will  inevitably result in a further increase in these statistics which are already  at an unacceptable level.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3353# Rob Gibson: Celebrating the F&eacute;isean Movement in the Highlands and Islands&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament welcomes the findings of a report commissioned by Highlands and  Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Arts Council on the F&eacute;isean Movement, which  was founded on the Isle of Barra in 1981, showing the important contribution of  the movement to the tangible economic and demographic benefits associated with  our traditional heritage that can build on the renewed sense of pride and of  vibrancy amongst young people in the Highlands and Islands and help to  strengthen bonds between the people growing up in the area and their sense of  place; congratulates all those who have participated in the various F&eacute;isean and  especially those who helped start off F&eacute;isean throughout the Highlands and  Islands, and considers that the Scottish Executive should recognise these  findings by securing further and greater funding for the movement to safeguard  its future for many years to come.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3351 Fiona Hyslop: Lothian and Borders Fire Services&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament expresses  concern at the Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Services Service Improvement  Plan 2005-10 which proposes cuts in night-time and weekend cover for the  Livingston area, served by the Craigshill fire station, from two full-time tenders  to one full-time tender and one tender served by retained firemen; notes that  this will lead to slower response times with implications for safety and rescue  opportunities and service generally across the whole of West Lothian; further  notes that this service improvement plan is the first of the plans required  under the recent Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 for each and every fire and rescue  board in Scotland and expresses its fears that, should reduced fire cover at  night and dependency on a retained service be approved by the Labour-dominated  Lothian and Borders board, other boards across the country may take this as the  green light to initiate similar cuts when they come to produce their service  improvement plans, and commends local community campaigners in Livingston for  highlighting the issue and its implications for the safety of their own and  other communities.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3290.1 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Disingenuous Liberal Democrats&mdash;</strong>As an  amendment to motion (S2M-3290) in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave out from &ldquo;Liberal  Democrat Group&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;Scottish Socialist Party to maintain a  constant description of its own policies; notes that when Tommy Sheridan  submitted his Bill proposal it was entitled Proposed Abolition of Council Tax  (Scotland) Bill; notes that Mr Sheridan wrote to the <em>Sunday Herald</em> on 9 November 2003 to suggest that the bill itself  would establish the principle of the replacement of the council tax with an  income-based alternative, rather than a particular scheme; notes, however, that  when the Bill was eventually published the preceding remarks were found to be  disingenuous as the Bill includes, from its first section to its last, an  explicit commitment to introducing a Scottish service tax set by central  government, a proposal which merits 104 lines in the Bill compared to just nine  for the abolition of the council tax; considers that the Bill, dominated as it  is by the introduction of a Scottish service tax, does not match the promises  made prior to its introduction; further notes the failure of the Scottish  Socialist Party to provide substitutes to be present at the Local Government  and Transport Committee meetings in Mr Sheridan&rsquo;s absence during consideration  of tendering of ferry services in the Clyde and Hebrides, the Licensing (Scotland)  Bill or to hear evidence on local authority audits, and acknowledges the  ongoing and consistent position of the Liberal Democrats on the need to replace  the council tax with a local income tax.&rdquo;</p>
