                                          Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Royal National Lifeboat Institution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recalls that the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was first founded in 1824, leading 30 years later to the formation of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), and has been responsible for the saving of over 200,000 lives; remembers that the service is dependent on the volunteers who both support and run the service, ensuring that the financial resources are there, with little or no cost to the public purse, to maintain the boats and equipment needed when disasters strike on the coast; believes that the RNLI provides the country with a first-class emergency service that is the envy of the world; wishes all supporters and volunteers of the RNLI every success, and commends and highlights the support given by Dalgety Bay Sailing Club and, in particular, the late Alastair Burnside who, with his wife, made a very special contribution locally to the work of the RNLI.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6014</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Microgeneration Feed-in Tariffs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the pioneering contribution made by households and businesses that have installed microgeneration capacity; expresses concern that, under the UK Government&rsquo;s Clean Energy Cashback scheme, those who installed their technology before 15 July 2009 will effectively be penalised for their forward thinking by receiving only nine pence per kilowatt hour for selling to the national grid compared with new feed-in tariff payment rates of up to 41.3 pence per kilowatt hour that apply to new generators who installed their technology after that date, and calls on the UK Government to recognise the innovation of those who broke new ground in this area and reward them at the same level as those installing microgeneration capacity for the first time after 1 April 2010.</p>
