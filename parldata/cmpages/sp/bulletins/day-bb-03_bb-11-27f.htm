          <p><strong>*S2M-674#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>7:84 
            Theatre Company</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 7:84 
            Theatre Company (Scotland) on the many ground-breaking achievements 
            in the first 30 years of its operation; commends its philosophy of 
            bringing touring productions and participatory outreach work to areas 
            of geographic and social isolation; notes, however, that the company 
            will struggle to survive if it loses its Scottish Arts Council funding 
            from March 2005, and believes that the Scottish Executive should investigate 
            the situation affecting 7:84 and other similar theatre companies.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-673</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Saving 
            7:84</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the great contribution 
            that 7:84 Theatre Company (Scotland) has made to the cultural and 
            political life of Scotland over many years; notes that a previous 
            attempt was made to close the company under the Tory government and 
            finds it deeply ironic that the company faces closure under a Labour 
            government, and calls on the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport 
            to intervene to ensure that the Scottish Arts Council has sufficient 
            funds to continue funding the theatre and that all Scotland's theatre 
            and music companies can continue to deliver stimulating and high standards 
            of work.</P>

            Draft Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Amendment 
            (Scotland) Regulations 2003</strong>-That the Environment and Rural 
            Development Committee recommends that the draft Producer Responsibility 
            Obligations (Packaging Waste) Amendment (Scotland) Regulations 2003 
            be approved.</P>

            and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 (Designation of Scotland River 
            Basin District) Order 2003 be approved.</P>

            (West Coast) (No.11) (Scotland) Order 2003 (SSI 2003/561)</strong>-That 
            the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency 
            Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.11) (Scotland)

          <p> <strong>*S2M-669</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Help 
            the Aged SeniorLine</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            that Help the Aged has decided to close their office in Scotland which 
            runs SeniorLine, the free telephone advice service for older people, 
            in December; recognises that experienced trained welfare rights advisers 
            have answered thousands of queries from people in Scotland, particularly 
            following the very effective campaign with the <em>Daily Record</em> 
            to promote the uptake of the new pension credit; is concerned that 
            if future calls from Scotland are answered by advisers in the London 
            office with no experience or training in Scots law and unaware of 
            policy differences between Scotland and the rest of the UK, such as 
            free personal care, the recent positive developments to remove the 
            barriers to the take-up of entitlements by senior citizens in Scotland 
            will be damaged and undermined, and therefore calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to ensure 
            the future security of Help the Aged, a partner organisation in the 
            take-up campaign, and particularly to reconsider the closure of the 
            Scottish office of SeniorLine.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-668</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Bhopal 
            Anniversary</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 19th anniversary 
            of the disaster at Bhopal; calls on the Dow Chemical Company to ensure 
            that its 100%-owned subsidiary Union Carbide, along with ex-chairman 
            Warren Anderson, end their 11-year absence from criminal proceedings 
            in Bhopal and face trial; calls on Dow to assume responsibility for 
            the long-term effects of Union Carbide's gases and provide long-term 
            health care for the victims and those as yet unborn who may be affected; 
            further calls on Dow to clean up Union Carbide's heavily-contaminated 
            factory site in Bhopal and provide safe drinking water for communities 
            whose wells have been poisoned by chemicals leaking from the factory, 
            and further calls on Dow to provide economic and social support to 
            people who have been incapacitated by their injuries and families 
            who have become destitute as a result of losing their breadwinner.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-667#</strong> <strong>Kate Maclean:</strong> <strong>Photodynamic 
            Therapy for the Treatment of Wet Age Related Macular Degeneration 
            (AMD)</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent decision by NHS 
            Quality Improvement Scotland on the use of photodynamic therapy for 
            the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and acknowledges 
            that photodynamic therapy is the only effective treatment for wet 
            AMD, the most aggressive form of the disease and the leading cause 
            of blindness in the UK, with around 650 new patients diagnosed with 
            wet AMD in Scotland every year; is deeply concerned that funding has 
            not been made available for clinicians to treat on the NHS those patients 
            who urgently require the therapy, and endorses the demand by the Royal 
            National Institute of the Blind Scotland and the Macular Disease Society 
            that the Scottish Executive ensures that funding is immediately provided 
            by all NHS boards, thereby saving the sight of those who could benefit 
            from the therapy.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-666</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Highlands 
            Tourism</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Highland tourism 
            group Highlands Loch Ness on the initiative and enterprise shown in 
            chartering the vessel <em>Lord of the Glens</em> and sailing it from 
            Buckie to Custom House Quay in London's docklands where it stood out 
            as a shining beacon at the World Travel Market Exposition and was 
            a focal point for those advertising the style and excellence of Highland 
            tourism.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-665</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Use 
            of Sewel Motions</strong>-That the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive's 
            use of the convention known as the Sewel motion; recognises that there 
            are occasional circumstances where the use of Sewel motions is an 
            appropriate legislative route; believes that such motions should not 
            be used for specifically political reasons and that an action of this 
            nature would undermine the authority of the Parliament; further believes 
            that it is possible for a process to be developed by which the Scottish 
            Parliament can fully scrutinise a bill that is in passage at Westminster, 
            and considers that this process would require a committee of the Scottish 
            Parliament to consider the UK bill with sufficient time to take evidence 
            and report, the Scottish Parliament to debate the committee's report 
            and agree recommendations for amendments to those parts of the bill 
            that relate to Scotland, such recommendations to be submitted to the 
            UK Parliament with sufficient time for their incorporation into the 
            bill and a second Sewel motion to be considered by the Scottish Parliament 
            to approve this bill as amended, before the bill is approved by the 
            UK Parliament.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-664</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>7:84 
            Theatre Company</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the valuable 
            cultural work of the 7:84 Theatre Company (Scotland) and its positive 
            innovative role in the social inclusion agenda; deeply regrets the 
            decision of the Scottish Arts Council to change the funding structure 
            for 7:84, and calls for the reinstatement of the three years core 
            funding package for the theatre in order that it can have the security 
            to continue with its work.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-663</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Greater 
            Glasgow NHS Board: Race Equality and Cultural Competency</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the publication of Greater Glasgow NHS Board's 
            race equality development programme; recognises the positive contribution 
            that the implementation of the programme will make to the health of 
            ethnic and cultural minorities in the Greater Glasgow area; congratulates 
            the multicultural health development team on the work that it has 
            done in developing the programme, and calls for the development of 
            similar programmes across the entire NHS in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-662</strong> <strong>Mike Watson:</strong> <strong>Rugby 
            World Cup</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the England team 
            on its victory over Australia in the final of the Rugby World Cup; 
            notes that its success was the result of four years of dedication 
            and preparation based on a strong club structure, which contains valuable 
            lessons for the Scottish Rugby Union; trusts that England will use 
            its term as world champions to help develop the game further throughout 
            the world, and hopes that, before defending its title in 2007, it 
            might commission a National Anthem of its own.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-661.1</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Physical 
            Activity: The Need for Improvement and the Cost of Failure</strong>-As

            out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the Executive's 
            plans to emphasise walking as one of the means to increase levels 
            of physical activity; encourages people to take more responsibility 
            for their own health and that of their family; calls for more access 
            to organised sport in schools and the community, and further calls 
            on the Executive to provide more support for the voluntary sector, 
            which provides a huge variety of sporting opportunities for children 
            and adults alike&quot;.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-661.2</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Physical

            after first &quot;physical activity in Scotland&quot; &quot;; recognises 
            that the physical activity levels amongst children and adults would 
            be enhanced by improved provision and access to community sports facilities&quot;.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-660.1</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> 
            <strong>Violence Against Women</strong>-As an amendment to motion

            notes with grave concern the escalating pattern of repeat victimisation

          <p><strong>*S2M-660.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Violence

            end and insert &quot;deplores the fact that while over 36,000 women 
            reported a domestic abuse incident to the police in the last 12 months, 
            over half of the incidents did not lead to the recording of a crime 
            or offence and only 66% of those recorded were referred to the procurator 
            fiscal; is appalled at recent research which shows that Scotland has 
            a prosecution rate of 10% and a conviction rate of 6% following rape 
            allegations, the second poorest conviction rate in Europe; welcomes 
            the &quot;prevention, protection, provision&quot; theme of the National 
            Strategy to Address Domestic Abuse in Scotland and work done to date, 
            but believes that the Scottish Executive must consider what action 
            could reasonably be taken to improve dramatically prosecution and 
            conviction rates for rape and other cases of violence against women.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-660.3</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Violence

            <strong>Cairngorm National Park P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta a' Ch&agrave;irn

            of the Cairngorm National Park, expresses concern that the provisional 
            Gaelic name being given to the park is P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta 
            a' Mhonaidh Ruaidh which translates as the Red Mountain National Park; 
            believes that this name is inaccurate and misleading as the national 
            park will contain both the Monadh Ruadh and the Monadh Liath mountain 
            ranges (Red and *Grey* mountains), and, in order to avoid confusion, 
            considers that the park's name should be the same in both English 
            and Gaelic, that is Cairngorm National Park and P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta 
            a' Ch&agrave;irn Ghuirm.</P>
