<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1585</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Going Live! Garnock Valley FM</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to note that Garnock Valley FM (GVFM) community radio station will go live to the public on 17 March 2008; recognises that the original 2006 launch of GVFM was due to the success of similar community radio stations in Saltcoats, Stevenston, Ardrossan and Girvan; commends the project partners, including North Ayrshire Council Community Learning and Development, University of the West of Scotland, Careers Scotland, Garnock Academy, NHS Ayrshire and Arran, the MATES community education project and Jobcentre Plus, as well as the many volunteers who will make the 28-day broadcast a success; recognises the value that the station will provide by broadcasting local news and featuring local bands and voluntary organisations, as well as focusing on health issues to increase awareness and access to health services within the community, and heartily encourages individuals who will be in the Beith, Kilbirnie, Dalry and Kilwinning areas to tune in to Garnock Valley FM on 87.9FM from 17 March to 13 April 2008.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1584</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Barra Lifeboat</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the heroic work done by the Barra Severn class lifeboat, as immortalised on a new first-class stamp launched on the isle of Barra on Thursday 13 March 2008; recognises that this is part of a set of six commemorative stamps on the theme Mayday - Rescue at Sea; notes that since the Barra Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station opened in 1931 there have been 505 launches and 412 lives saved; recognises that these stamps highlight the brave actions of the men and women of the RNLI who regularly risk their own lives attempting to save the lives of others, and commends not only the Barra lifeboat crew, but those crews from around the coast, on their courage and dedication.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1583</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Water Charge Exemption for Churches and Charities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament praises the work of local charities in promoting social justice in our communities; recognises that, in the words of Reverend Jock Stein of the Church of Scotland Dunfermline Presbytery, &quot;Church premises are used by all kinds of community bodies, including groups like Mothers and Toddlers, Scouts, Guides, and Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;; notes that these organisations, when they are able, try to make donations to the churches whose facilities they use but that such donations are barely enough to cover current operating costs; objects to any proposal to discontinue the water charge exemption that makes the work of these institutions feasible; notes the estimated average &pound;1,000 annual water charges that these churches and charities might face, and that &quot;depending on the size of their premises bills could be up to a third of the annual income of some small charities&quot; which would force them to reduce their activities, resulting in a loss of valuable social services to the community; asserts that the estimated &pound;2.4 million it would cost to maintain this exemption for all charitable organisations in Scotland is well worth paying in exchange for the variety of services that they provide, and urges the Scottish Government to sympathetically review the results of the recent consultation and support Scotland&rsquo;s charities by allowing the exemption to stand.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1582</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Housing and Regeneration Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions in the Housing and Regeneration Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 15 November 2007, relating to the executive competence of Scottish Ministers to enter into agreements for the provision of services with the Housing Corporation and/or Welsh Ministers, on such terms and for such payment which they consider appropriate, so far as these matters fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
