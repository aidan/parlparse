            the consultation paper <em>The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service: Proposals 
            for Legislation</em> builds on the responses received to the Scottish 
            Executive&#146;s first policy paper; is concerned, while commending

            service and work together to provide greater impetus to protect the 
            public from fire to reduce Scotland&#146;s poor record of fire fatalities, 
            that the new National Framework, which includes centrally-driven top 
            down targets, performance indicators, monitoring and guidance, will 
            prejudice local operational flexibility, and calls on the Executive 
            to confirm that it will not cut the number of fire brigades.&quot;</p>

            at end &quot;and, however, expresses concern about certain detailed 
            proposals contained in the consultation paper including, for example, 
            the move from existing minimum standards of fire cover to an as yet 
            untested risk management system and the removal of the safeguard of

            the transitional period moving from the traditional approach to standards 
            of fire cover to Integrated Risk Management Plans (IRMPs), the IRMPs 
            must be tested, validated and piloted to prove that they are leading
