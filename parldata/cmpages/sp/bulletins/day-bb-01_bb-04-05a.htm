            <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Airdrie to Bathgate Rail Line</strong>—That 
            the Parliament recognises the continuing need for the rail line between 
            Airdrie and Bathgate to be re-opened; agrees that such a project would 
            provide a service to around 200,000 people and as a result would improve 
            labour market access to businesses in the M8 corridor, and welcomes 
            the joint work being undertaken by North Lanarkshire and West Lothian 
            Councils to highlight the benefits and value for money that the re-opening 
            of the rail line would offer.</font></p>
