                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5837# Gil Paterson: We Like Milngavie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the launch of the campaign group known as We like Milngavie, which was set up to oppose plans by Tesco to double the size of its current premises in Milngavie; considers that this would seriously affect the village theme of the Milngavie town centre; believes that local town centres are the lifeblood of any local community and that town centres across Scotland are losing their character; further considers that there is increasing local opposition to these plans, and would welcome consideration of the views of the people of Milngavie and Bearsden with regards to this proposed development with a view to not overdeveloping the sight.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5836 Bill Wilson: Royal Secrecy against the Democratic System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that in any democratic system of government freedom of access to information is an essential safeguard of that democracy; further considers that freedom of information should apply to all individuals within the system of government, both elected parliamentarians and the head of state; notes that, at present, the UK system of government is a constitutional monarchy with the Queen as head of state; believes that, as such, royal papers should be available for inspection on an equal footing with any other government document, and therefore calls on the UK Government to drop plans to allow greater secrecy for the royal family than is proposed for any other government document.</p>
