          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2119</strong> <STRONG>Cathy Jamieson:</STRONG> <STRONG>Constitutional Reform Bill - UK Legislation</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the principle of having a clear and transparent separation between the judiciary and the legislature and agrees that provisions in the Constitutional Reform Bill establishing a Supreme Court, and provisions consequential thereto, so far as they relate to matters within the legislative competence of the Parliament, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2118</strong> <STRONG>Mr Tom McCabe:</STRONG> <STRONG>Gambling Bill - UK Legislation</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the principle of including in the Gambling Bill provisions which confer powers on the Scottish Ministers, including powers to set fees and make regulations on the conditions to be attached to gambling premises&rsquo; licences and permits, and agrees that the relevant provisions to achieve this end should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2117</strong> <STRONG>Nicol Stephen:</STRONG> <STRONG>Executive-Supported Lifeline Ferry Services in the Clyde and Hebrides</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s continued commitment to supporting and investing in lifeline ferry services in the Clyde and Hebrides; endorses its proposals for tendering the main bundle of ferry services as required under European Union rules, and welcomes the proposals for a final round of consultation to obtain the views of local communities and freight service users before proceeding with the tender under EU rules.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2116#</strong> <STRONG>Paul Martin:</STRONG> <STRONG>Reviewing Arrangements for Managing Registered Sex Offenders</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament commends those who took part in the Voice for our Children march on 30 October 2004; recognises that, following the murder of eight-year-old Mark Cummings by registered sex offender, Stuart Leggate, there is a requirement for a root-and-branch review of how registered sex offenders are monitored and managed in the community; believes that the current sentencing policy for dealing with registered child sex offenders is grossly inadequate and requires review, that it is not acceptable that registered sex offenders are able to legally act under an alias identity and that the current housing allocation policies for dealing with registered child sex offenders present a serious risk to local communities; considers that an inquiry should be held into the events leading up to the murder of Mark Cummings, and believes that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency, bring forward measures that will ensure that the risk to our children posed by registered child sex offenders is radically minimised.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Shiona Baird<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mr Kenny MacAskill<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2115</strong> <STRONG>Alex Neil:</STRONG> <STRONG>Research Pooling for Chemistry and Physics</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the initiative to pool physics and chemistry research groups in Scottish universities; notes that the aim is to create two world-class research alliances, ScotCHEM for chemistry and SUPA for physics, with over 380 researchers; notes that this collaboration is a bottom-up initiative from the chemistry and physics researchers with a &pound;37 million investment from six universities, the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and the Office of Science and Technology; believes that ScotCHEM and SUPA will help develop a distinctive, radically-new research landscape in Scotland with powerful, well-resourced research communities, attractive to leading researchers around the world, producing world-class research, and believes that this collaborative and creative initiative will be crucial to ensuring that the Scottish research base is able to maintain its competitive edge both internationally and within the United Kingdom and to support Scotland&rsquo;s knowledge economy.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2114#</strong> <STRONG>Mr Adam Ingram:</STRONG> <STRONG>Robert Burns National Heritage Park</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the impending disintegration of the Robert Burns National Heritage Park; questions the wisdom of the actions of South Ayrshire Council in withdrawing from the joint board responsible for the park and, in particular, in leasing out the park&rsquo;s visitor centre, the Tam O&rsquo;Shanter Experience, to a commercial operator thereby eliminating a vital income stream for the upkeep of the Burns cottage and museum; expresses alarm at the formal withdrawal of an application to the Heritage Lottery Fund which, if granted, would have allowed rebuilding and modernisation of the Burns museum enabling proper storing, archiving and display, and considers that all interested parties should work together to ensure that flagship assets for Burns heritage tourism are properly developed in good time for the major events planned for the 2009 Homecoming Year, marking the 250th anniversary of the birth of the national bard.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2113</strong> <STRONG>Jeremy Purvis:</STRONG> <STRONG>Congratulations to David Steel on Appointment to the Order of the Thistle</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lord Steel of Aikwood, first Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament and former MP for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, on his appointment as a Knight of the Order of the Thistle, and recognises that the Order represents the highest honour in Scotland probably dating to the reign of James III and that the appointment recognises the substantial contribution that Lord Steel has made to political and social life in Scotland and the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2112</strong> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Erskine</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the contribution made to Scottish life by the Erskine organisation through its care for ex-servicemen and women throughout Scotland since its foundation in 1916 as Erskine Hospital for men who had lost a limb in the First World War; recognises its continuation as an independent Scottish charity supported by voluntary contributions, providing physical and emotional care to ex-service people harmed in the Second World War and the many wars since; further recognises its employment of people with disabilities in its commercial gardening, furniture and print outlets, and wishes it well in its continuing development of its services at Erskine and in Edinburgh.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Trish Godman<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2111</strong> <STRONG>Richard Lochhead:</STRONG> <STRONG>Green Energy Awards</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all nominees and winners of the Green Energy Awards on 2 December 2004 who represented businesses, communities, individuals, organisations and academia committed to harnessing the potential for renewable energy in Scotland; further congratulates the Scottish Renewables Forum for its organisation of the event; commends the efforts of those involved in all sectors of renewable energy in Scotland for the work they do to try and exploit the potential for Scotland to become one of the most prominent renewable energy nations in the world, and calls on the Scottish Executive to assist these groups and individuals to help Scotland develop and harness its renewable energy potential and catch up with those nations who have already developed significant renewable energy sectors.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rob Gibson<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Patrick Harvie<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Shiona Baird<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Jim Mather<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2110</strong> <STRONG>Chris Ballance:</STRONG> <STRONG>Safeguarding Rural Shops</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with alarm that proposals being considered by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to deregulate the system of wholesale distribution of newspapers and magazines could jeopardise the guaranteed distribution of publications to rural retailers, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the OFT without delay to guarantee consumers continuing access to a wide range of reasonably priced publications and diminish the threat of closure to rural village shops.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2109</strong> <STRONG>Linda Fabiani:</STRONG> <STRONG>Burns Monument in Kilmarnock</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive, in full consultation with East Ayrshire Council, to guarantee the restoration of the Burns Monument in Kay Park, Kilmarnock; expresses deep concern for the firemen who were injured in the fire which destroyed the monument, and calls for an investigation into the failures of East Ayrshire Council in their maintenance and management of this historic monument.</p>
