<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions  and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on  which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments  lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin  every Monday. That list also contains  any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the  Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked  with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3806 Allan Wilson: Skills  and Training for a Modern Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees that  developing the current and future workforce of Scotland is key to ending  poverty and sustaining economic growth; recognises the very good progress that  is being made in reducing unemployment through investment in skills and training,  and welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s intention to work with the United Kingdom  Government, employers and employer organisations, universities, colleges,  training organisations and other public agencies to drive forward opportunities  for workforce development to strengthen the economy and improve the  employability and skills of individuals across Scotland, in particular those  furthest from employment and those in lower paid, low skilled jobs.</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicol  Stephen<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3805 Carolyn Leckie: Detention  of Tehran Bus Workers Union Leader&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern  the continued detention of Mansour Osanloo, leader of the Tehran bus workers  union, the Sherkate Vahed syndicate, following a strike on 25 December 2005 over  wages and conditions, notes that the International Confederation of Free Trade  Unions has written to Mr Mahmoud Ahmadjinejad, President of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, expressing great concern about the health of Mansour Osanloo  and his continued detention, and calls on the Iranian authorities to release  him immediately.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3804 Eleanor Scott: Coastal  Flood Protection&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the first anniversary of the  deaths of five members of the MacPherson/Campbell family on South Uist on 11  January 2005 as a result of a severe storm and sends heartfelt sympathies to  relatives and friends of the family; welcomes the funding package from the  Scottish Executive which, according to Hugh Henry&rsquo;s reply to question S2W-19378  on 6 October 2006, amounts to &pound;9 million; welcomes the final agreement by  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to a study of the Stoneybridge shingle bank and other  vulnerable coastal areas, with a view to giving recommendations as to an  appropriate, costed engineered solution, eligible, hopefully, for grant aid  under the Coastal Protection Act 1949; calls on all coastal local authorities  to consider providing specific support for communities to develop and protect  natural storm defences, and calls for the speedy installation of an early coastal  flood-warning system to prevent further avoidable loss of life.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3803 Hugh Henry: The Draft Police Act 1997 Amendment (Scotland) Order 2006&mdash;</strong>That the  Justice 2 Committee recommends that the draft Police Act 1997 Amendment  (Scotland)  Order 2006 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3797 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees  that the draft Scotland Act 1998 (Modifications of Schedule 5) Order 2006 be  approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George  Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3796 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees  that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning)  (West Coast) (No. 18) (Scotland)  Order 2005 (SSI 2005/626) be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George  Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3795 Mr John Swinney: Local  Government Finance&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the widespread concern over  the inadequacy of the local government finance settlement for 2006-07 and  2007-08; notes the recommendations of the Finance Committee that the Scottish  Executive should reconsider the settlement; welcomes the moves to make government  more efficient but calls for this process to be applied equitably across  national and local government and conducted with greater rigour; calls on the  Executive to restore the &pound;58.5 million in efficiency savings to local  government baselines and to make available to local authorities &pound;34.7 million  from the pre-Budget report consequentials on condition that this is used to  deliver a real-terms freeze in council tax, and recognises that these are  short-term improvements to the unfair council tax that will only be resolved  when the system is abolished and replaced by a local income tax based on the  ability to pay.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3794 Donald Gorrie on behalf of the Procedures Committee: Private Bill Committee Assessors&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament notes the Procedures Committee&rsquo;s 1st Report, 2006  (Session 2), <em>Private Bill Committee  assessors</em> (SP Paper 481), and agrees that the changes to Standing Orders  set out in Annexe A to the report be made with effect from 19 January 2006.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3793 Mark Ballard: Support  Town Centres&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes calls from the Forum of Private  Business for shoppers to support their town centre shops and shun &ldquo;parasitic&rdquo;  out-of-town shopping centres and retail parks; supports efforts to protect  small and medium-sized retailers which are vital to ensuring the diversity and  independence of the retail sector; notes that money spent in town centre shops  is retained in the community, bringing growth and prosperity to the local area,  whereas money spent in retail parks disappears out of the area, supporting only  a limited number of low-paid jobs and leading to local economic decline;  condemns the short-sighted policies that have led 20,000 high street shops to  close in the United Kingdom since 1997 and laments the consequent emergence of  &ldquo;clone town Britain&rdquo;, and calls on the Scottish Executive and local authorities  to do everything in their powers to support locally owned businesses and ensure  that they are able to compete with retail parks on a truly level playing field.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3792.1 Rob Gibson: Sustainable  Development Strategy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3792) in the name of Ross  Finnie, insert at end &ldquo;and further calls on the Executive to set targets for  individuals, businesses, local authorities and communities to play their part  in reducing Scotland&rsquo;s global footprint while working to gain full powers for  this Parliament over the key areas of policy that are needed to guarantee a  sustainable Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3792.2 Alex Johnstone: Sustainable Development Strategy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion  (S2M-3792) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &ldquo;but  considers that vision and aspiration, while commendable, will not of themselves  deliver for future generations and therefore the Executive must begin to  deliver greater tangible evidence of its own commitment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3792.3 Mr Mark Ruskell: Sustainable Development Strategy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion  (S2M-3792) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &ldquo;and  moreover makes it clear that leadership and consistent action from the top of  government is of critical importance to enable lasting change; considers the  progress so far by the Executive since 1999 to be richer in rhetoric than  reality but, nevertheless, a full 13 years since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992,  welcomes this first step towards a meaningful strategy; considers that  sustainable development should be the top priority of government, and  recognises the critical role of this Parliament and its structures in engaging  fully with the strategy and holding the Executive to account on its delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supported by: Mark  Ballard<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3792.4 Rosie Kane: Sustainable  Development Strategy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3792) in the name of  Ross Finnie, leave out from &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;regrets that the  strategy fails to address the environmental needs of Scotland&rsquo;s communities  with projects such as the M74 extension and the Dalkeith bypass developments  going ahead, despite local community opposition; further regrets that the  Executive has failed to introduce third party right of appeal for communities  in the draft Planning Bill which is indicative of its inability to understand  and address the environmental needs and concerns of individuals and  communities, and therefore calls on the Executive to review its sustainable  development policy in light of these concerns and to redraft its policy to  ensure environmental justice for all.&rdquo;</p>
