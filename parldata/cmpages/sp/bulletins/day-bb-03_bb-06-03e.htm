            information.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-577</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive why there has been no public consultation in 
            respect of Lakeland Marine Farms Ltd's application for three cod farms 
            off the north coast of the Isle of Arran, given that the application 
            was made two years ago, and whether it is normal and acceptable for 
            this to be the case.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-578</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether there has been any involvement in the 
            last two years of (a) Scottish Natural Heritage, (b) the Scottish 
            Environment Protection Agency and (c) North Ayrshire Council in relation 
            to plans by Lakeland Marine Farms Ltd to establish three cod farms

            such as those being proposed by Lakeland Marine Farms Ltd to establish 
            three cod farms off the north coast of the Isle of Arran and what

            development comprising 10 cages of nets with a circumference of 100 
            m and a depth of 15 m.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-581</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it has received information about any 
            estimates that, in order to produce 2,000 tonnes of farmed cod, 8,000 
            tonnes of wild fish would be required as food and what assessment 
            it has made of the consequent impact of dumping 6,000 tonnes of excrement 
            on the seabed off the north coast of the Isle of Arran, with particular 
            regard to the proposals of Lakeland Marine Farms Ltd.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-582</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether residents of the Isle of Arran should 
            be consulted before any extension is made to the existing fish farm 
            in Lamlash Bay and what the reasons are for the position on this matter.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-583</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive how many people have died in each of the last five 
            years as a result of (a) tobacco consumption, (b) obesity, (c) alcohol
