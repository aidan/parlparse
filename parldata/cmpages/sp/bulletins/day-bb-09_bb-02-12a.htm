<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.10 am&#9;</strong>Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Member&rsquo;s Oath/Affirmation - Anne McLaughlin</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> &#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Healthcare Associated Infections&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3428</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Healthcare Associated Infections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 15-point plan for tackling healthcare associated infections drawn up with the assistance of Professor Hugh Pennington and Professor Brian Toft and endorsed by the C.diff Justice Group, which represents the latest group of families to be affected by this problem; notes that the plan proposes a range of measures, including a revised target to reduce Clostridium difficile in hospitals by 50% by March 2011 compared with the current target of 30%; believes that comprehensive strategic action is required to tackle healthcare associated infections, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to implement this plan alongside other measures to combat healthcare associated infections and report regularly to the Parliament on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s progress in tackling this issue. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3428.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Healthcare Associated Infections</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3428) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the high priority that the Scottish Government is placing on tackling and driving down healthcare associated infection, backed by investment of &pound;54 million; notes that a national action plan is in place and that a national reporting template has been introduced to ensure that NHS boards have the necessary policies and practices in place to drive forward improvements in areas such as governance, leadership and surveillance; further notes that NHS boards are now required to report publicly on hospital by hospital performance on MRSA and Clostridium difficile rates, environmental cleaning and the causes of adverse incidents; further acknowledges that a target of a minimum 30% reduction in Clostridium difficile rates by 2011 is in place and that there is a zero tolerance approach on hand hygiene; also notes that the Healthcare Associated Infection Task Force has been asked to consider implementation of the elements of the Labour Party&rsquo;s 15-point plan not already underway, and&nbsp;further notes that the Scottish Government has agreed to progress the electronic bed management system supported by the Conservative Party and that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing will report regularly to the Parliament on the progress being made on tackling healthcare associated infection.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3428.1</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Healthcare Associated Infections</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3428) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end &quot;and, given that the cabinet secretary has deemed the publication of the report of the independent review team on Clostridium difficile at Vale of Leven Hospital as not being prejudicial to the police inquiry, calls on the Scottish Government to establish a public inquiry immediately.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Housing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3427</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the growing crisis in Scottish housing with rising numbers of repossessions, the continuing challenge of homelessness and the falling number of houses being built; calls on the Scottish Government to ensure the urgent and effective implementation of the accelerated spending programme, introduce a realistic housing association grant formula and negotiate with the housing association movement a range of flexible models of procurement, and further calls on the Scottish Government to examine, as a matter of urgency, alternative means of expediting the provision of land and infrastructure and the regeneration of communities. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3427.1</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor: Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3427) in the name of Mary Mulligan, insert at end &quot;; welcomes the second-stage stock transfer to local housing associations in Glasgow; notes that housing stock transfer in Scotland would achieve &pound;2 billion of debt write-off from HM Treasury, and therefore urges the Scottish Government to engage proactively with the 26 local authorities yet to transfer their stock with a view to effecting stock transfers to community-based housing associations and facilitating further investment in affordable housing in Scotland.&quot; </p>
