<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5522</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Simclar (Ayrshire) Ltd</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views with dismay the announcement of the closure of the Simclar factories in Irvine and Kilwinning, with the loss of 420 jobs; extends its sympathies to the workers affected and their families; calls on the adminstrators to ensure that the appropriate redundancy packages are issued as a matter of urgency; acknowledges that the number of job losses could increase when the impact on supplier industries is also confirmed; calls for the speedy implementation of the Partnership Action for Continued Employment initiative to help workers retrain and find new employment; recognises that, while this is a blow to the North Ayrshire economy, nonetheless the Irvine Bay area remains a good place to live and work, with quality schools and a motivated, highly skilled workforce; acknowledges the contribution that the Irvine Bay Regeneration Company could make to the recovery of the local infrastructure by working with partner agencies to attract private investors to North Ayrshire, and asks the Scottish Executive to consider urgently how it can further support local economic development in the area.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5521&diams; </strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that people who suffer from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a severe and progressive genetic muscle wasting disease predominantly affecting boys and for which there is currently no cure, are dying in Scotland on average 10 years earlier then their counterparts in England; believes that an improvement in the life expectancy and experiences of these young people must be a priority for the Scottish Executive; considers that, in addition to enhanced medical research, better support services, equipment and adapted housing can make a massive difference to the quality of life of people with DMD and can contribute to extending their life expectancy; welcomes the development in 2003 of the Scottish Muscle Network, based at Yorkhill, as a national managed clinical network benefiting patients in Stirling and across Scotland, but believes that more must be done to improve both life quality and life expectancy for people with DMD in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5520</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Cash for Honours: The Scottish Dimension</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the First Minister to make a full disclosure of any knowledge he has concerning the current cash for honours investigation and, in particular, asks him to disclose any knowledge of peerages being offered to MSPs as an inducement to them to retire and whether he is aware of any attempt to cover up correspondence on such subjects.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5519&diams; </strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Time to Act</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that, despite the many advances made in ending discrimination, removing barriers and creating opportunities for people with disabilities and learning difficulties, the recent tragic accident in Glasgow, where a girl with learning difficulties threw herself in front of a train after reportedly being bullied and treated without due regard to her condition by staff and management at her work, highlights the need to initiate a parliamentary debate into the need for support systems, such as buddy systems which have been highly effective elsewhere, to be introduced in the workplace and for companies to be required to implement specific policies and training to ensure that tragic accidents like this are avoided.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5518</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>National Status for Scots Charities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the anomaly of registered UK charities, based and operating solely in England, that are given &quot;national&quot; status which enables them to raise funds in Scotland but with no requirement to provide support or benefit to nations outside England; notes that this places Scottish-registered charities at a disadvantage through not being able to raise funds in England, and urges ministers to enter into negotiations with their English counterparts to resolve this unequal situation and allow registered Scottish charities to raise funds on an even playing field with those based and operating solely in England.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5517</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>NUS Scotland Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the campaign and website, www.scotlandsfuture.com, launched by NUS Scotland to promote increased participation by students in the upcoming elections, believing that awareness campaigns and public debates like the one set up by NUS Scotland serve to reignite interest in politics and stimulate debate on the issues concerning voters, which in turn leads to higher voter turnout at elections and thus increased democratic legitimacy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5510.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5510) in the name of Mr Mark Ruskell, leave out from &quot;further notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that Scottish Water is failing its customers because it is inefficient, misallocates resources, overcharges customers, particularly businesses which were overcharged by &pound;44 million every year, and holds back much-needed development; further believes that Scottish Water must be removed from state control and transferred into a &quot;not-for-dividend&quot; organisation in line with Welsh Water, and considers that this would enable Scottish customers to benefit from the lower costs and higher levels of service enjoyed by their counterparts south of the Border.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5510.2</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5510) in the name of Mr Mark Ruskell, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the substantial improvements that have been made in Scottish Water&rsquo;s performance, all of this having been achieved while keeping Scottish Water in the public sector; recognises that the objectives set by ministers for 2006-14, which properly recognise the social and environmental priorities of the Scottish Executive, will not only deliver further improvements in drinking water quality, environmental protection, and customer service but also relieve development constraints, upgrade the water and sewerage system and reduce leakages; recognises that the role of the Water Industry Commission for Scotland is to assess the lowest reasonable overall costs of delivering the objectives that ministers have specified, taking account of appropriate external benchmarks, and affirms that Scottish Water operating in the current regulatory framework will go on to deliver further improvements in this vital public service.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5501*#*</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Awareness of Long-Term Conditions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the role of the Long-Term Conditions Alliance Scotland, set up to give an independent voice to the concerns of the estimated two million people in Scotland who live with a long-term medical condition; further welcomes the success of the alliance in bringing together 150 voluntary and community organisations covering a wide range of conditions; understands that, according to the 2003 <em>Scottish Health Survey</em>, it is estimated that 39% of people in the Tayside NHS board area have a long-term medical condition; whilst recognising the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s role in supporting the establishment of the Long-Term Conditions Alliance Scotland, notes with concern that in most industrialised nations and in many developing countries long-term conditions are now the most common cause of death and that social deprivation is strongly associated with the prevalence of long-term conditions; further recognises that long-term conditions affect all age groups in different ways and at different times throughout their lives, including the lives of friends, relatives and carers, and considers that policy-makers should take account of the impact of their policies on people with long-term conditions.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5494.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Green Procurement</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5494) in the name of Patrick Harvie, insert at end &quot;and for the social and environmental criteria to include trade union recognition and facilitation and evidence of corporation tax payment within the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5494.2</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Green Procurement</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5494) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;and calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;further regrets that, whilst there are some good examples of local food procurement in Scotland, as the Environment and Rural Development Committee&rsquo;s 8th Report (2006) notes, &quot;there is no sense that the Executive has a robust strategy for rolling this out&quot;; further regrets the bureaucratic hurdles faced, especially by small and social firms, in tendering for public contracts, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to establish a dedicated procurement unit to act as a single point of entry for the public sector and to be tasked with taking forward ways of procuring local produce without contravening European law.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5494.3</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Green Procurement</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5494) in the name of Patrick Harvie, insert at end &quot;and further calls on the Executive to report to the Parliament, prior to dissolution, providing details of any measures taken, and their results, in response to the call made by the Environment and Rural Development Committee in its report published in May 2005 for public procurement to be used to tackle climate change.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5494.4</strong> <strong>George Lyon:</strong> <strong>Green Procurement</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5494) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s record on sustainable/green procurement; notes that Scottish-specific guidance on sustainable procurement for public sector buyers and sellers is available on the Executive&rsquo;s website; notes that the Executive has issued best practice guidance on sustainable procurement, including a contribution to the Best Value toolkits, to local authorities and public bodies, and welcomes the contribution which public procurement has made, and will continue to make, to the achievement of the partnership commitments to a successful, sustainable Scotland.&quot;</p>
