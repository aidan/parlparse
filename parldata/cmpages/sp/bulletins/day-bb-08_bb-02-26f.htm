<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1418</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Asthma and Physical Exercise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Asthma UK Scotland&rsquo;s attempts to encourage all children to take part in exercise; acknowledges that well-controlled asthma is no barrier to playing sport and keeping fit, and believes that every school should have an asthma policy to ensure that children with asthma are given every opportunity to take part in normal school life.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1417</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Scottish Slimmer of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Mandy Martin from Guardbridge, Fife, on winning the Scottish Slimmer of the Year award; recognises the hard work that Mandy, as a mother of two and a chip shop worker, put in to reach her target weight after spending two years on the diet; notes the challenges faced by working parents to ensure that they find time to eat a balanced, healthy diet, and fully supports the healthy example that Mandy is setting as a role model to her children and countless others across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1416</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Billy Liddell for the SFA&rsquo;s Hall of Fame</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the achievements of Dunfermline-born footballer Billy Liddell; recognises that his achievements have been inspirational to generations of young Scottish footballers; further recognises that, after playing for Kingseat Juniors and Lochgelly Violet, he went on to spend over 20 years with Liverpool Football Club, where he was instrumental in its success for much of this time, earning the club the nickname &quot;Liddellpool&quot;, and was honoured by the club with a commemorative plaque at Anfield in 2004; is surprised that despite this success and his 28 caps for Scotland, Billy Liddell&rsquo;s contribution to football has not yet earned him a place in the Scottish Football Association&rsquo;s Hall of Fame, and calls for fans from across the country to support a campaign to ensure that Billy Liddell enters the Hall of Fame this year to join his 51 fellow countrymen who are already honoured in this way and for a fitting memorial to these achievements to be established in Townhill, Dunfermline.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1415</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>28 February 2008 - European Day of Action on Prison Overcrowding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Federation of European Public Sector Unions&rsquo; (EPSU) day of action on 28 February 2008 to raise awareness of prison overcrowding across Europe; is concerned at the increasing prison population across Europe over the last decade, which stands at over 600,000; recognises that most prisons across Europe are now overcrowded, with more prisoners than establishments can accommodate healthily and humanely; believes that overcrowding negates many aspects of prisoner rehabilitation and consequently impacts on efforts to reduce reoffending and leads to further increases in prisoner numbers, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with trade unions and others within the justice system to improve prison conditions by further investment in the prison estate alongside robust alternatives to imprisonment where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1414</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Think Differently About Autism - I Exist</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that all adults with autism should be supported to achieve their potential, including those with Asperger syndrome; recognises that too many adults with autism are isolated and ignored, struggle to access the support that they need and are heavily dependent on their families; congratulates the National Autistic Society - Scotland for highlighting these issues in its campaign, &quot;Think Differently About Autism - I Exist&quot;; believes that recording the number of adults with autism nationally and locally would help to improve the planning and delivery of appropriate services; further believes that the barriers which prevent adults with autism from accessing services can be overcome; asserts that social support and person-centred services for adults with autism are required, and urges the Scottish Government to expand its expertise and leadership on autism and work with local authorities and NHS boards to put in place changes that will transform the lives of adults with autism.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1413</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>The Royal Society of Edinburgh @ Arbroath</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Society of Edinburgh on the launch of the RSE @ Arbroath initiative and all those involved locally in enabling an exciting programme of events to go ahead; notes the success of the Arbroath project in developing activities with and for young people and the wider public, which includes the arts and humanities as well as science and technology-based subjects; notes that the Royal Society of Edinburgh is keen to further extend its events and education programme, and hopes that the Arbroath project will inspire similar regional ventures in communities throughout Scotland in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1412</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>The Glennie Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the potential impact of the implementation of the Glennie Report on rural dental practices throughout Scotland as it will require dental surgeries to have a separate sterilisation room, new equipment and more staff to meet its requirements; notes that many dental surgeries cannot physically be altered to accommodate these changes and acknowledges that, if enforced, these changes will hit NHS dental surgeries, particularly rural dental surgeries, hardest; is further aware of the existing acute lack of dentists in the Highlands and Islands and believes that, if the Glennie Report&rsquo;s recommendations are implemented, it will mean the closure of some of the few remaining surgeries, leaving people to travel even further for treatment or being forced to go private, and calls on the Scottish Government not to enact Glennie and to take urgent action to halt the decline of the rural dentist.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1411</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Whitelees Primary: &quot;Fairtrade is the Answer&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Fairtrade Fortnight which runs from 25 February to 9 March 2008; congratulates the pupils and staff of Whitelees Primary School, from Abronhill in Cumbernauld, for writing and recording their song &quot;Fairtrade is the Answer&quot; which is being sold to raise funds for the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund&rsquo;s work in the area of fair trade; also congratulates Cumbernauld College for assisting with the recording of this song, and wishes Whitelees Primary School every success in its endeavours at promoting awareness of fair trade in its home town and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1410</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Strengthening of Offshore Workers&rsquo; Rights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent tribunal decision that ruled that offshore workers are entitled to four weeks paid leave which on a pro rata basis equates to 14 days annual paid leave under the European Working Time Directive; notes that previously offshore workers have been unable to claim such a right when working a &quot;two weeks on, two weeks off&quot; shift pattern; recognises that this victory is due to the hard work and campaigning of the trade unions representing offshore workers, Unite, RMT and OILC, and looks forward to this decision being the starting point for the further strengthening of workers&rsquo; rights in the offshore industries.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1331*#*</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Anorexia and Bulimia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with unease that it is estimated that more than 80,000 people in Scotland suffer from anorexia, with 4,700 suffering from bulimia, and that the number of people diagnosed with eating disorders has increased by more than 15% since 1999, according to NHS Scotland; *further notes that Eating Disorders Awareness Week takes place from 25 February to 1 March 2008*; is aware that, despite guidelines issued by the health service watchdog in November 2006, Scotland still trails behind the rest of the western world in the treatment of eating disorders; is aware that the foremost expert on anorexia and bulimia in the United Kingdom, Bryan Lask, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of London, has voiced concern that the system for treating those with eating disorders in Scotland is &quot;positively dangerous&quot;; regrets that there is still no specific advice for GPs, despite every practice having patients suffering from eating disorders, and that only two private clinics in Edinburgh and Glasgow provide specialist care at a cost of around &pound;3,000 per patient per week; *believes there should be examination of* why there is not one consultant specialising in eating disorders employed by the NHS in Scotland and *that consideration should be given to* how best to tackle this problem which can prove fatal and is deeply distressing both for patients and their families, and understands the need for ongoing research into eating disorders and their treatment.</p>
