          <p><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1910</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>John Peel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament mourns the passing of John Peel; regards his outstanding and lasting contribution to popular culture in the UK as unique; notes that he was responsible for bringing a diverse range of music to generations of young and old alike through his radio shows, championing everything from punk rock to reggae and hip hop; notes particularly that he gave help and assistance to many Scottish bands who would have otherwise been unable to make progress in an industry that is over-dominated by the multinational record labels, and believes that his legacy will last forever in the music that he so dearly loved.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1909</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Parenting Across Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 25 to 31 October 2004 is National Parenting Week; notes the publication of a MORI poll, commissioned by Parenting Across Scotland (PAS), a multi-agency partnership led by Children 1st and funded by the Scottish Executive, the findings of which include that two-thirds of adults questioned believe that bringing up children today is more difficult than when they were young and that materialism and financial pressure, discipline, children&rsquo;s safety and work-life balance are the main reasons for this, that love, affection and a good stable upbringing are seen as the most important factors in raising children and that over two-thirds of adults were not aware of any organisations that provide advice and support to parents, and believes that this poll, and other research being undertaken by PAS, should be used to inform policy and service development and help ensure that greater support is offered to parents and families across Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1908</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mr Frank McAveety be appointed to replace Kate Maclean on the Finance Committee.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1907</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Margaret Jamieson be appointed to replace Rhona Brankin as the Labour Party substitute on the Enterprise and Culture Committee.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1906</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mrs Mary Mulligan be appointed to replace Rhona Brankin on the Audit Committee.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1905</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mr Frank McAveety be appointed to replace Rhona Brankin on the Education Committee.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1904</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> <strong>Deplorable Comments by Bruce McFee MSP</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the description of the Union Flag as a &quot;butcher&rsquo;s apron&quot; by Bruce McFee MSP; calls on Mr McFee to withdraw his statement and to apologise for this offensive slur on the flag of the Black Watch battle group, and deplores this implied attack on the exemplary conduct of Scottish military personnel serving in the peacekeeping force in Iraq.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1903</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>10th Anniversary of the National Lottery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the National Lottery is currently celebrating its 10th anniversary; further notes the lack of support for good causes in Scotland and therefore congratulates the Fair Share funding initiative which is designed to target lottery money at areas, including specific areas in Glasgow, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire and Dundee, which have not received a fair share of lottery funds in the past, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to work with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to set up a not-for-profit Scottish lottery with the funds raised by lottery customers in Scotland being exclusively used for the benefit of the people, communities and organisations in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1902#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Commonwealth of Learning Award for Open University Access Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Open University&rsquo;s (OU) short course programme &quot;Openings&quot; consists of short flexible courses designed to give students, particularly from under-represented groups, an experience of OU study, the intention of which is to bridge the divide between further and higher education and to give students clear pathways for their future development; congratulates the OU for winning the prestigious Commonwealth of Learning Award for excellence in distance education materials at the recent pan-commonwealth conference in New Zealand for its &quot;Understanding Children&quot; course, part of the Openings programme, which has received international recognition for giving over 36,000 people a stepping stone into higher education; notes that the course was praised for its &quot;innovative approach to designing, developing and implementing an access course&quot;; notes that the quality of the multi-media course materials and the level of support provided to students were also given special mention; commemorates the 100th anniversary on 3 November 2004 of the birth of Jenny Lee, formerly Labour MP and Baroness Lee of Asheridge, the founder of the Open University and celebrates the fact that Jenny Lee, wife of Aneurin Bevan, was born and lived her early life in Cowdenbeath, in the Dunfermline East constituency, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider a service of commemoration not only to celebrate Jenny Lee&rsquo;s life but also to mark the amazing achievements and contribution which the Open University continues to make to our world.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Cathie Craigie<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1901</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Proposed National Front March in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen City councillors on their brave decision to ban a proposed march by the National Front and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward legislation to ensure that local councillors representing local opinion can make decisions on proposed future marches without fear of oppressive punishment.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1900#</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Deafblindness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the European Parliament Declaration of Rights of Deafblind people which was formally adopted on 1 April 2004 and recognises deafblindness as a distinct disability separate from hearing or sight impairment; considers that more should be done to identify, correctly assess and provide appropriate services for this unique group who cannot automatically benefit from mainstream services or services for people who are either blind or deaf, and further considers that councils should make appropriate provision for this uniquely disadvantaged group, ensuring that they have the same provision of services as outlined in the guidance issued under section 7(1) of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 for England and Wales.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1899.1</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Making the Most of Scotland&rsquo;s Forests</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1899) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, insert at end &quot;; further believes that increased emphasis should be placed on the principal economic concerns of the industry; calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce a specific target to promote the use of forestry for biomass; believes in the objective of a greater mix of public, community and private ownership of forestry, and urges ministers to take further steps to promote the use of timber in the construction industry.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1899.2</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Making the Most of Scotland&rsquo;s Forests</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1899) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, insert at end &quot;notes, however, that new planting is at an all-time low, that Forestry Commission Scotland and Forest Enterprise Scotland are budgeted to receive &pound;80 million in the next financial year from the taxpayer with the consequential competitive disadvantage to the private sector and that the promised Executive statement on the link between the agricultural and forestry industries following the introduction of the single farm payment has still not been made, and believes that these factors demonstrate that the Executive betrays a lack of understanding of the importance of the private sector to Scotland&rsquo;s forestry industry.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1899.3</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Making the Most of Scotland&rsquo;s Forests</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1899) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, leave out from first &quot;forestry&quot; to end and insert &quot;forests currently make to the economy and the environment; welcomes the creation and restoration of more than 8,600 hectares of native woodland in the last two years as a start; notes, however, that only 4% of our land is now covered with indigenous trees, and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase funding for forestry grants with a view to extending the national forest with an emphasis on native species and to supporting schemes which maximise the benefits from our forests in addition to reducing our global &quot;forest footprint&quot;, such as using Scottish timber for building and waste lumber for biomass for heating, securing better access for the enjoyment of our woodlands, increasing community ownership and management of woodlands and promoting the creation of forest crofts.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1898.1</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland&rsquo;s Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1898) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that it is a basic human right to have the comfort, security and stability of a warm affordable home and that decent suitable housing is crucial to the individual&rsquo;s quality of life, whether young or old, and crucial to healthy, thriving communities and the economy at large; notes that, after five years of the Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition, homelessness has increased substantially and that the right to buy has seriously damaged the socially rented sector; therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to revisit its right to buy policy, to utilise the proposed planning and housing legislation to facilitate the provision of affordable housing and to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s people have access to the homes they deserve across tenures and that the scourge of rooflessness, bed and breakfast and &quot;sofa surfing&quot; is consigned to history.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1898.2</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland&rsquo;s Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1898) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that housing stock transfer to community-based housing associations, a policy introduced by the Conservatives, gives tenants greater rights, responsibilities and input into the way their housing is run; believes that, to improve the standard of public housing for everyone, it is necessary to step up the process of devolving control of housing from local authorities to local community groups; further believes that, to improve the standard and supply of private housing for rent or purchase, a review and modernisation of the Scottish planning system is required to simplify and speed up the development process, and notes with concern the restraint on new housing construction currently imposed in Scotland by the inadequacies of Scottish Water&rsquo;s sewerage network.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1898.3</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland&rsquo;s Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1898) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;views the end of the right to buy and its replacement with a right to rent reduction as necessary to maintaining the amount of affordable social housing for rent and calls on the Scottish Executive to make funding available to allow registered social landlords to build 12,000 houses per annum, in line with the recommendations of the Chartered Institute of Housing and the Scottish Council for Single Homeless.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1898.4</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland&rsquo;s Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1898) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to increase affordable housing provision and the beneficial consequences that this will have for a range of people in Scotland; notes that the welcome increases in the provision of new affordable housing may be offset by a loss of affordable housing stock through the right to buy; requests that the Executive&rsquo;s review of right to buy in 2006 under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 is informed by an open and comprehensive consultation on future options for right to buy; recognises the Executive&rsquo;s efforts to improve standards in housing quality, especially with the introduction of the housing quality standard, fuel poverty programmes and the forthcoming Housing Bill; further recognises the contribution that poor quality housing and lack of environmental awareness in housing design make to Scotland&rsquo;s disproportionate ecological footprint and number of winter deaths; supports WWF Scotland in its call for the Executive to set a target for 10,000 new or refurbished sustainable homes by 2012; believes, therefore, that whilst there have been notable achievements flowing from devolution for housing in Scotland, many challenges lie ahead, and calls on the Executive to report at appropriate intervals on its progress on improving the quality and availability of housing.&quot;</p>
