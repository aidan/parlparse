<p align="center"><b>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</b></p>
<p><b>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</b></p>
<p><b>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</b></p>
<p><b>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the<a href="#end"> end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</b></p>
<p><b>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</b></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</b></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</b></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</b></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</b></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><b>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</b></p>
<p><b>A full list of </b><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><b>current motions</b></a><b> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</b></p>

<p><b>*S3M-7451</b> <b>Alasdair Morgan:</b> <b>The Scallops (Luce Bay) (Prohibition of Fishing) Order 2010</b>&mdash;That the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Scallops (Luce Bay) (Prohibition of Fishing) Order 2010 (SSI 2010/375).</p>
<p><b>*S3M-7450</b> <b>Rob Gibson:</b> <b>Praise for Sustrans Cycle Network</b>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 15th anniversary of the Sustrans cycle network; understands that Scotland performs better than elsewhere in the United Kingdom as the number of trips made on the National Cycle Network in Scotland increased from 31.3 million in 2008 to 37.3 million trips in 2009, a 19.2% increase from 2008, and a 31.8% increase from 2007, exceeding the outcome of a 15% increase in trips on the network that was agreed between the Scottish Government and Sustrans in 2007; congratulates Sustrans and the Scottish Government on this achievement, and calls on the Scottish Government to give further support to the network and encourage more people to cycle.</p>
<p><b>*S3M-7449</b> <b>Marilyn Livingstone:</b> <b>Investment in Social Housing</b>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that continuing to invest in social housing is important and that significant economic and social benefits arise from housing investment and activity; commends the Fife Housing Association Alliance (FHAA) for delivering, in partnership with Fife Council, 1,300 new homes over the last five years; considers that the FHAA has created an appropriate partnership framework and structures that guarantee the delivery of quality affordable housing in Fife; notes with concern the representations made by the FHAA that, without continuing support from the Scottish Government, its success and ability to continue to deliver affordable social housing will be jeopardised; advocates that housing policy and funding allocations should primarily be driven by the needs of lower-income households that cannot afford the costs of housing without financial assistance, and believes that a properly funded housing policy based on such principles delivers good quality housing, thereby improving health, educational chances, employment opportunities and general wellbeing.</p>
<p><b>*S3M-7448</b> <b>Rob Gibson:</b> <b>Wick Marina Success</b>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 50% increase in the number of leisure craft using Wick harbour in one year, which has brought hundreds of extra visitors to Wick; further notes and welcomes the fact that the harbour has been promoted as part of the Viking Trail, which includes marinas in Orkney, Shetland and Inverness; congratulates Wick Harbour Authority on this success and recognises the benefits that it brings to the harbour, town and county; wishes the harbour trust increased success in the future, and recognises the importance that marinas play in the wider sea-going Scottish tourist economy.</p>
<p><b>*S3M-7447</b> <b>Karen Whitefield:</b> <b>St Patrick&rsquo;s Opera Group</b>&mdash;That the Parliament pays tribute to Shotts St Patrick&rsquo;s Opera group on its 60th anniversary; congratulates it on what is considered its triumphant recent production of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, which played to a series of full houses at Howden Theatre in Livingston; considers that every aspect of the production was of a high quality, including tremendous displays from all the performers, a visually stimulating backdrop, precise and elegant costume design and first class music, direction and choreography; applauds the enthusiasm, talent and commitment of all the members of St Patrick&rsquo;s Opera Group, and wishes them every success in their future artistic endeavours.</p>

<p><b>S3M-7405</b> <b>Linda Fabiani:</b> <b>NHS, Equality Matters</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Health Awards 2010 were held on 11 November 2010; notes that the awards seek to give recognition to the workers in NHS Scotland and those working in health services who might be in jobs that normally do not have a high profile but who genuinely make a difference and show commitment to the NHS; recognises the importance of equality in healthcare and the work required to ensure that the needs of excluded or disadvantaged groups are met and that discrimination or prejudice in the delivery of healthcare is tackled, and, therefore, while congratulating all winners, congratulates in particular Attiq Asghar, Equality and Diversity Officer, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, resident of East Kilbride, who received the Equality in Healthcare Award.Supported by: Nanette Milne, Sandra White, Christina McKelvie, Jackie Baillie, Maureen Watt, Bob Doris, Rob Gibson, Bill Kidd, Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell, Jamie Hepburn, Gil Paterson, Sarah Boyack</p>
