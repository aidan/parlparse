<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4096</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Stop the Failed ID Card Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing roll-out of the ID card scheme, which it considers to be a baseless unproven policy, which is estimated to cost in excess of &pound;5 billion; denounces unchecked executive powers whereby individuals would be managed by executive order and could be added to the national identity register by the Home Secretary without their consent; condemns excessive accumulation of personal data, which will lead to lifelong surveillance in a database state; joins with David Blunkett MP, the former Home Secretary who introduced the ID card scheme, in insisting that the UK Government scrap this unnecessary scheme, described by some as an ineffective plastic poll tax; questions this use of resources at a time when the Scottish Government is being asked to make cuts in vital public services, and hopes that UK ministers will appreciate a citizen&rsquo;s right to privacy, freedom and trust, which seemingly has again been disregarded under Labour.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4095</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Biggar Spring Music Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Biggar Spring Music Festival will take place on 24 May 2009 at Persilands Farm, Biggar; believes that the festival is an excellent prelude to the Biggar Little Festival in October and welcomes the excellent array of local food, drink and music that the spring festival has to offer; further believes that these festivals are a wonderful celebration of arts and culture, bringing a range of live performances to communities outside of the major urban centres; congratulates the festival organisers on gaining such a diverse line-up, which includes internationally renowned Scottish author Ian Rankin, and wishes everyone involved all the best for a successful festival this year.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4094</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Geographical Confusion at Museums Galleries Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with surprise that the spring 2009 edition of <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Museums and Galleries Quarterly</em>, published by Museums Galleries Scotland, which rightly celebrates the opening of the Caithness Horizons museum, describes the museum as being in the &quot;most northerly town in the UK&quot;; is concerned that an organisation that describes itself as the &quot;lead body for the advocacy, funding and development of over 340 museums and galleries in Scotland&quot; should have such a flawed knowledge of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s geography, and considers that, if this is indeed the geographical view of Scotland&rsquo;s museums, then the ownership of the great wealth of antiquities from Orkney and Shetland currently held by the National Museum of Scotland should be transferred to the museums in Orkney and Shetland with those museums deciding which artefacts to lend to Edinburgh, rather than the other way round, as at present.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4093</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Scottish Pupils Studying Modern Languages</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the rising number of pupils studying modern languages at both higher and advanced higher levels in Scotland with advanced higher pupils increasing by 20% from 655 in 2007 to 820 in 2008; observes that, while numbers of pupils studying German have fallen, those studying higher Spanish have increased to 1,327 in 2008, compared to only 874 10 years ago, and that, although Latin has dropped in popularity, Gaelic has increased by over one third over the last 10 years; believes that these trends of popularity not only demonstrate more choice available to students but also that pupils have the capacity to learn a language that they believe suits them best; further notes that local authorities are using different ways to increase access to higher and advanced higher courses, including promoting collaborative arrangements between schools and the use of new technology that provides access to a range of higher and advanced higher courses, and that these approaches are enabling more pupils to study a wider range of subjects than ever before; firmly believes that modern languages are key to creating a more successful Scotland with opportunities for all to flourish through increasing sustainable growth and giving young people the opportunity to study and work in any EU Member State, and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals through the Curriculum for Excellence to reinforce the expectation that schools will offer a modern language by no later than primary six and deliver exciting, engaging and relevant language learning.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4092</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government Investment in Eco-friendly Trains</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling of a new fleet of eco-friendly trains at a cost of &pound;200 million; notes that the funding provided by the Scottish Government will pay for 38 Class 380 electric trains, which will go into service in September 2010; further notes that the trains will service Ayrshire, Glasgow Central, Inverclyde, Renfrewshire and also serve the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, and acknowledges the continued investment by the Scottish Government to deliver greener methods of public transport.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4091</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Planned Industrial Action in Grangemouth, Alloa, Dunfermline and Cowdenbeath Royal Mail Delivery Offices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision by postal workers based in the Grangemouth delivery office in central Scotland, as well as delivery offices in Alloa, Dunfermline and Cowdenbeath, to call for strike action over the weekend of 9 and 10 May 2009; further notes that the decision to strike is in response to the modernisation of delivery and sorting jobs, which the Communication Workers Union feels has been implemented without proper consideration; regrets that the workers feel forced into industrial action, which will affect mail services to businesses and households across the areas served by these offices; notes that the action coincides with protests across Scotland against the UK Government&rsquo;s plans to part-privatise the Royal Mail, and believes that modernisation of the Royal Mail must take place in the context of continued public ownership, with the priority placed on public service and full consultation of workers as any changes are introduced.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4090</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>S2S, Scotland&rsquo;s Fourth Annual Social Enterprise Trade Fair</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in organising Scotland&rsquo;s fourth annual Social Enterprise Trade Fair, S2S 2009; notes that almost 500 delegates and over 80 exhibitors attended the event at the Edinburgh Corn Exchange; further notes that in a time of recession social enterprises are well placed to provide high quality goods and service to both public and private sector suppliers while also delivering on their social purpose; recognises that Scotland&rsquo;s 3,000 social enterprises provide between &pound;2 billion and &pound;2.5 billion of its annual GDP, and welcomes the contribution that these social enterprises make towards social, environmental and economic sustainability throughout Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4089</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Subs and Jobs at HMNB Clyde</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the decision of the UK Government to have Her Majesty&rsquo;s Naval Base Clyde as the main operating base for all classes of submarines across the United Kingdom; considers that this decision will sustain the existing jobs at Faslane and bring hundreds of new jobs to the area thereby providing a welcome boost to the local economy and the wider Scottish economy; believes that this is a tremendous vote of confidence in the workforce at Faslane and underlines the strategic importance of the base in the maritime defence of the UK; further believes that this is a positive dividend from being part of the UK, and congratulates the UK Government for this decision.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4088</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Scrap ID Card Scheme in the Face of &pound;500m Cuts in Scottish Public Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the UK Government&rsquo;s ID card scheme is an enormous waste of money, especially in the face of cuts of &pound;500 million in Scottish public services that are being imposed by that same government; considers that the &pound;5.75 billion cost of the scheme could be far better spent on frontline public services than on a scheme that poses an unprecedented and unnecessary infringement to the civil liberties of the general public, and believes that the UK Government should take heed of the advice of David Blunkett MP, previously a proponent of ID cards as Home Secretary eight years ago, and scrap the ID card scheme.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4086</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Newspaper Public Notices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Government&rsquo;s intention to put an end to advertising public notices in newspapers; believes that this will adversely affect many local newspapers as it will amount to a loss of approximately &pound;10 million in advertising revenue at a time when the industry is at its most vulnerable and crucially that this will mean that public notices are less accessible to the general public; also notes that not everyone has access to the internet, with only 44% of people in Glasgow having access to the internet compared to the national Scottish average of 64%, that this proposed change will reduce the access that people have to key announcements that affect their community and that it is therefore a backward step for the democratic process, and calls on the Scottish Government to review this decision and ensure that there is no diminution in the accessibility of public notices.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4085</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Multi-million Pound Plan to Build New Homes in Inverclyde</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by Inverclyde Council to give River Clyde Homes permission to build 636 new homes at a cost of &pound;23.5 million; notes that the funding has been made available from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Affordable Housing Investment Programme; acknowledges and welcomes the comments by Councillor Moran, convener of Inverclyde Council&rsquo;s Safe Sustainable Communities Committee that, &quot;This funding is more than we had expected to be announced and will have an extremely positive impact on the area&quot;; further notes that this is the biggest social housing development in Inverclyde for some 40 years, and congratulates the Scottish Government for its continued investment to local authorities to help deliver affordable housing.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4083#</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Operation Focus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the commander, officers and staff of F Division of Lothian and Borders Police, the wider Lothian and Borders force and its community partners for the outstanding success of Operation Focus, which targeted drug dealers in West Lothian; notes that the outcomes to date of Operation Focus include 63 arrests as a consequence of police raids, the seizure of dangerous drugs and police officers addressing over 10,000 secondary school pupils in the affected communities with anti-drugs messages that resulted in spontaneous applause from the students; joins with the people of West Lothian in commending Chief Superintendent Ronnie Liddle and all his team in West Lothian for the strong action that they have taken against those who seek to profit from the misery of drug dealing in our communities, and restates the belief that there is no place for drugs or drug dealers on Scotland&rsquo;s streets.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4082</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Woman to Woman - An Oral History of Rape Crisis in Scotland 1976-1991</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Woman to Woman: An Oral History of Rape Crisis in Scotland, 1976-1991</em>, which chronicles the experiences of women involved in the first 15 years of the rape crisis movement in Scotland; notes that Rape Crisis Scotland has evolved from a single telephone in a back room to a thriving national network providing free support, advice and solidarity to survivors of rape and sexual assault; applauds the dedication and commitment of the many Rape Crisis Scotland volunteers and staff who have been at the forefront of the campaign against violence against women and girls for 33 years; congratulates Rape Crisis Scotland on its role in raising awareness of and changing attitudes towards rape and sexual abuse, and further notes that, through campaigns such as This is Not an Invitation to Rape Me, the struggle to eradicate sexual violence against women and to secure justice for survivors is far from over and continues today.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4080 *#*</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Declining Bee Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern reports of the continuing decline in bee numbers and in the number of other key pollinators; notes the importance of bees for the production of honey and, along with other species, their vital importance in food production and in support of biodiversity; supports measures to research and understand better what may be causing the reported declines as a basis for appropriate further actions; further notes that in some areas, such as Colonsay, the varroa mite, which is known to be responsible for some of the decline in bee numbers, is not present, *and considers that every effort should be made to maintain that position and sustain bee and other key pollinator numbers.*</p>
