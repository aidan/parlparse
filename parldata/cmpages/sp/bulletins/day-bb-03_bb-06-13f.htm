          <p><strong>*S2M-139</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Famous 
            Grouse Experience, Glenturret Distillery, Crief</strong>-That the 
            Parliament congratulates the Famous Grouse Experience at the Glenturret 
            Distillery, Crieff, on celebrating its first anniversary; welcomes 
            the increase in visitor numbers and the financial boost that this 
            tourist attraction has brought to the Crieff and Perthshire tourist 
            industry, and notes the importance of the whisky industry to the tourist 
            economy and the need to develop improved visitor attractions that 
            focus on traditional Scottish industries.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-138#</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses</strong>-That the Parliament considers that there should be 
            a speedy resolution to the long-standing issues relating to pay and 
            qualifications in the early years and childcare sector; notes the 
            Scottish Executive's failure, over a prolonged period, to address 
            the situation, and recognises the need for an interim solution in 
            terms of increased pay for nursery nurses across the board as well 
            as a longer-term review.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-137</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Health 
            and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That 
            the Parliament endorses the principle of ensuring consistency in recovery 
            of NHS charges where compensation is paid following injury as set 
            out in Part 3 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and 
            Standards) Bill and agrees that the relevant provisions to achieve 
            this end including extending ministers' powers to make regulations 
            under a scheme for recovery should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-136</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Fireworks 
            Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament endorses the principle 
            of making enabling regulations for the supply and use of fireworks 
            as set out in the Fireworks Bill and agrees that those provisions 
            in the Bill that relate to devolved matters should be considered by 
            the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-135#</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Industrial 
            Action at Grampian TV</strong>-That the Parliament expresses concern 
            at the prospect of industrial action at Grampian TV and considers 
            that all sides should show restraint while negotiations to find an 
            amicable solution continue.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-134#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Pet 
            Passports</strong>-That the Parliament notes the ongoing discussions 
            between the Scottish Executive, officials from the State Veterinary 
            Service and Superfast Ferries regarding the introduction of a pet 
            passport scheme on the Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry route; recognises 
            the great demand for such a scheme, not just from pet owners, but 
            also from organisations such as Guide Dogs for the Blind and Hearing 
            Dogs for the Deaf; believes that a pet passport scheme would greatly 
            increase the attraction of this route by allowing hundreds of Scottish 
            pet owners to travel to mainland Europe with their pets directly from 
            Scotland, and considers that the Executive should do everything in 
            its power to assist the implementation of the pet passport scheme 
            in Scotland as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-133</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>National 
            Diabetes Week: 8 to 14 June 2003</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that approximately 150,000 people in Scotland have been diagnosed 
            with diabetes; further notes that it is estimated that another 90,000 
            people in Scotland remain undiagnosed; recognises that diabetes accounts 
            for about 5% of NHS costs, which equates to £320 million in Scotland 
            annually, and that the incidence of type 1 diabetes in Scotland is 
            24 per 100,000 per year in the under-15 population and one of the 
            highest incidence rates in the world; notes that early diagnosis reduces 
            the risk of developing life-threatening complications and that 33% 
            more people with diabetes die from coronary heart disease in Scotland 
            each year than in the rest of the United Kingdom, and therefore urges 
            the Scottish Executive to raise public awareness of the seriousness 
            of diabetes, thus increasing early detection, to promote screening 
            programmes for those most at risk, to eliminate post-code variable 
            treatment and to take as an example the life of Janet Scott, who has 
            had insulin injections for 70 years and, as a healthy and fit 72 year 
            old, walks 5 miles each day.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-111</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Inaugural

            the inaugural Scots Traditional Music Awards which will take place 
            on 13 September 2003; notes the high calibre of nominations across 
            all 15 categories; is confident that the existence of these awards 
            will highlight the extent and diversity of Scottish traditional music, 
            song, dance and languages, and looks forward to traditional music 
            gaining a more prominent profile in the future cultural life of Scotland.
