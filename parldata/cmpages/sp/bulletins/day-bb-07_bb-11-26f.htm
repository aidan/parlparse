<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-924</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Smart Metering</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Look Smart, a campaign by energywatch, the Energy Retail Association and Utility Week; recognises that smart metering has the potential to put an end to estimated energy bills, give consumers accurate, understandable and up-to-date information on the energy that they are using, remove the additional cost to service pre-payment meters and have a positive impact on fuel poverty and carbon emissions; notes that a national introduction of smart meters has broad support from the energy industry, consumer groups and environmental organisations, and calls on the Scottish Government to press the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to fulfil the expectation outlined in the Energy white paper that, within the next 10 years, all domestic energy customers will have smart meters.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-923</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>SNP Lochee By-election Victory</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates SNP Councillor Alan Ross on his decisive victory in the Lochee by-election; notes that the SNP received 49% of the first preference votes, and further notes that the result shows the support of the people of Dundee for the SNP in government and on Dundee City Council and demonstrates that the removal of tolls on the Tay Bridge and the historic council tax freeze have been warmly welcomed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong>, Willie Coffey<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Bashir Ahmad<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-922</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>BBC Trust Report into New BBC Gaelic Channel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the concerns expressed by many regarding the BBC Trust&rsquo;s report into a new Gaelic digital television channel; notes that the BBC Trust has stated that more information needs to be forthcoming before it can support the new channel; believes that all those with the interests of Gaelic at heart should write to the BBC Trust during the consultation period into the new channel, and urges them to support the new channel and inform the trust of the benefits that it would bring, not only to Gaelic speakers but to many others who are supporters of the language and culture.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-921</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Nitrate Vulnerable Zones</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Government&rsquo;s flawed proposals on nitrate vulnerable zones; further notes with regret Scottish Government advice that the already long-awaited Scottish Rural Development Programme cannot be approved until the NVZ Action Programme has been formally set out; recognises the potential cost to farmers of having to increase farm slurry storage capacity as a result; notes in particular that the proposals, if implemented, will increase the closed period from the current four weeks to up to 26 weeks which will place intolerable pressure on pig, poultry and cattle farmers, and calls on the Scottish Government to review the proposals urgently and take into account the views of those in the industry and the scientific evidence that indicates that the closed period should be significantly shorter than what is proposed.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-920</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Rights of Cohabitees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the nature of relationships has changed over recent years and that many couples, for a variety of reasons, choose to cohabit rather than marry; is aware that many individuals have found themselves with no legal protection when their relationship breaks down after investing a great deal in it over many years; understands the need to articulate the law with regard to the rights of cohabitees clearly, given that many mistakenly believe that they have greater legal protection than they do in reality, and understands that, on the whole, it is women who find themselves disadvantaged by this lack of clarity.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-886&diams;</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Tackling Health Inequalities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the study of general practices in the west of Scotland which found that &quot;the increased burden of ill health and multimorbidity in socioeconomically deprived areas results in high demands on primary care and is associated with poorer access to care, less time spent with the doctor, higher GP stress and lower patient enablement in encounters for psychosocial problems&quot;; believes that projects such as the Community Health Shop in Barlanark, which provides a range of alternative therapies from massage and aromatherapy to yoga, reflexology, reiki and others alongside a number of other groups and facilities such as a parents group, a young persons counselling group, alcohol and drug counselling, money advice sessions and GP drop-ins among others is a wonderful example of how these problems can be dealt with at a local level; notes that the Community Health Shop in Barlanark provides services to many communities which otherwise would not normally have access to them or would have to be provided by the local health authority, and considers that, due to the huge benefits in terms of community wellbeing and cost savings to local health authorities, funding for these projects should be met in full and expanded throughout areas of deprivation.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-880</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Nursery Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the increase in funding entitlement to free nursery education for Scotland&rsquo;s three and four-year-olds from 33 weeks to 38 weeks but is concerned that this funding, under the guidance from the Scottish Government, is available in many local authorities only from the start of the term following the third birthday of the child and leaves many parents in the position of not being able to provide a suitable nursery place for their three-year-old child until the start of the following term, and calls on the Scottish Government to review the guidance provided to local authorities to encourage funding to be available from the child&rsquo;s third birthday and ensure that adequate funding is provided to all local authorities for early years education to be available from the day of a child&rsquo;s third birthday.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-877</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Liberal Democrat Plans for Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the suggestion by the leader of the Liberal Democrats that he intends to amend the Scottish budget to mutualise Scottish Water; considers that this proposal has not been thought through; notes that Scottish Water cannot be mutualised or privatised through the budget process and that any reduction by the Liberal Democrat or Labour party in the funding allocated by the Scottish Government to Scottish Water will lead to increased water charges for all Scottish taxpayers, including pensioners, and urges the Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties to state clearly which public services they intend to cut in any attack on the Scottish budget.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-876#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Democratic Deficit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern for the rights of democratically elected members of Glasgow City Council and the residents they represent as a result of Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s ruling Labour administration preventing open and democratic debate of important issues to Glasgow at the special Glasgow City Council meeting on 15 November 2007, called to discuss business that was curtailed at the previous meeting, by voting to end the meeting before the first motion had even been debated in the face of opposition from SNP, Green and Conservative councillors and before important issues concerning services for young people, the impact of the 2012 Olympics on lottery funding and housing for asylum seekers and refugees could be debated; notes that such actions do nothing to foster political co-operation to the detriment of both the council and, more importantly, the people of Glasgow, and believes that, as a means to creating an effective working environment in which the interests of the people of Glasgow are put first, such petty and juvenile actions should be seriously reviewed before more valuable time is used up without real debate being able to take place.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-873</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Threatened Closure of the King&rsquo;s Theatre in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the King&rsquo;s Theatre in Edinburgh faces closure following a decision by the City of Edinburgh Council not to fund a refurbishment plan until at least 2010; notes the comments of the Chief Executive of the Festival City Theatres Trust which runs the venue on the council&rsquo;s behalf that such a delay threatens the King&rsquo;s Theatre with closure on health and safety grounds within two years; recognises the important contribution that the Tollcross venue has made in its 101-year history to the cultural life of Edinburgh, the Lothians and the east of Scotland and which continues today, including its role in Edinburgh&rsquo;s festivals; believes that funding for refurbishment should be prioritised accordingly, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to enter into funding negotiations with the Scottish Government and the Festival City Theatres Trust with a view to securing a viable future for the King&rsquo;s Theatre.</p>
