<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7706&diams;   Helen Eadie: Celebrating the Coalfields Regeneration Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament remembers that coal mines across the United Kingdom were closed during the 1980s and 1990s and considers that the effects were devastating not only to workers and their families but to their wider communities especially in Scotland in towns and villages such as Lochgelly, Cardenden, Kinglassie and Kelty where the scars run deep and have left an enduring regeneration challenge; celebrates the fact that in 1999 the Coalfields Regeneration Trust was formed as an independent charity operating on a UK-wide basis, funded in Scotland by the Scottish Executive, and is the only organisation dedicated solely to the social and economic regeneration of coalfield communities; further commemorates the efforts of miners across the centuries in helping to build Scotland into what it is today and, in recognition of their efforts, pledges to continue to do all that it can to say thank you to folk in those coal-mining communities whose harshness of life over the years entitles them to fulsome support, and would welcome a demonstration of gratitude on behalf of all of the people of Scotland by ensuring full financial support is given to the Coalfields Regeneration Trust in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7705&diams;   Linda Fabiani: Scottish Chambers International</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of Scottish Chambers International by Scottish Chambers of Commerce, including Lanarkshire Chamber of Commerce; considers that this will offer an unparalleled range of specialist international trade support services to the Scottish business community, and congratulates Scottish Chambers of Commerce on this enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7704 John Swinney: Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7703 Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell: Violence against Christian Communities in Egypt and Iraq</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns violence against any religious or faith community as an affront to human liberty and rights and urges the UK Government to express its abhorrence at recent attacks on Christian communities at worship in Egypt and Iraq and to press the authorities in these countries on the need to make the strongest efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7702 Mr Frank McAveety: Shettleston Scheme a Boost for Bookworms</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of Shettleston railway station&rsquo;s book swap initiative that is being led by the east-end based ticket officer, Michael Cochrane; believes that this initiative promotes reading and encourages engagement with the area&rsquo;s history; hopes that what it believes will be the increase in passenger numbers associated with the new direct service from the station to Edinburgh will help the project go from strength to strength, and considers that the success of this innovative scheme is further evidence of the unique role played by the east end in Glasgow&rsquo;s rich and diverse cultural experience.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7701&diams;   Jamie Hepburn: Possible Introduction of Car Parking Charges at Croy Railway Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of a new park-and-ride facility at Croy Railway Station in Central Scotland; considers this development to be long-overdue and believes that it will improve the travel and commuting experience for thousands of rail passengers in Croy, Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and beyond; notes that, in its submission to Transport Scotland&rsquo;s 2009 consultation on station car parking policy in Scotland, North Lanarkshire Council stated its position that &quot;station parking charges would probably only be required in town centres or other areas where they might be used by non-rail travellers.&quot;; therefore notes with concern reports that North Lanarkshire Council is considering the introduction of a daily charge for users of the facility; believes that a charge for use of the park-and-ride will have a negative economic impact on travellers who currently rely on the car park as part of their daily journey and would act as a disincentive for drivers who might otherwise choose to complete their journeys by rail via Croy Station, and believes that a consultation with station users on these plans would show a lack of support for car parking charges at Croy Railway Station.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7700 Stuart McMillan: Invest Fossil Fuel Levy in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that there is a growing call in Scotland for funds from the Fossil Fuel Levy account, currently over &pound;190 million, to be invested in creating sustainable jobs in Scotland&rsquo;s green energy industry; notes with concern the admission by the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Chris Huhne MP, and his colleague, Philip Wynn Owen, on 11 January 2011 that bankers&rsquo; bonuses could be a feature of a new green investment bank, which it understands is to be established using Scotland&rsquo;s Fossil Fuel Levy money as part of the initial &pound;1 billion capital investment; acknowledges the investment that has already taken place in the renewable energy industry by the current SNP government, which it considers has led to new jobs and world-leading technology, and therefore urges the UK Government to release Scotland&rsquo;s Fossil Fuel Levy as a matter of urgency to allow Scotland to further enhance its green reputation.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7699 Rob Gibson: The Highlands, a World Tourism Destination Accolade</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with appreciation that the Highlands has been named as one of the top 20 tourist destinations in the world for 2011 by what is considered the prestigious <em>National Geographic Traveler</em> magazine; notes the importance of this accolade in bringing the region to wider world attention and the importance of the tourism industry in the Highlands; understands that the main reasons for it achieving this rating was due to outdoor activities, culture and history as well as scenery, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue its support for tourism in the Highlands and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7698 Sandra White: Celtic Connections 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the return of what is considered Glasgow&rsquo;s world-class Celtic Connections festival as it celebrates its 18th anniversary in real style with more than 1,500 artists performing 300 events from 13 to 30 January in venues across Glasgow; considers that, since its inception, the festival has grown to become truly global in its outlook, with an eclectic mix of musical genres fusing around bold Celtic harmonies while showcasing Glasgow as a rich, diverse and exciting city to visit; further notes that, every year, the festival&rsquo;s educational programme provides thousands of Scottish schoolchildren with the opportunity to experience and enjoy their cultural heritage through free schools concerts and in-school workshops, which, it considers, has benefitted over 170,000 children from all over Scotland since 1999, including pupils from over 70% of schools in Glasgow, and congratulates all those involved in delivering such a world-class event.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7681&diams;   John Scott: Save the River Doon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the application made by Scottish Power to reduce by *8.5 million gallons per day* the water flow in the River Doon; expresses its concern at the potentially adverse effect that such a reduction in water flow would have on the ecology of the river, on the tourist economy of Ayrshire and Scotland to which the river contributes and on the quality of bathing waters around Ayr; considers that the River Doon has an iconic place in the culture of Scotland, particularly through the works of Robert Burns, and does not believe that the water flow in the river should be reduced.</p>
