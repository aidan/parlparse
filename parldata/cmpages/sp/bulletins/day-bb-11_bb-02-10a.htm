</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Business: Early Intervention in Health and Education</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-7923 Murdo Fraser: Early Intervention in Health and Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of early childhood development and the impact of early intervention in determining future health, social wellbeing and educational achievement of individuals; notes the large and growing body of evidence that highlights the importance of child and parental interaction in the early years of life; recognises the vital role performed by health visitors in supporting families in the early years; notes with concern that, in seven NHS board areas, there was a fall in health visitor numbers between 2009 and 2010; supports a national health visiting strategy that ensures that all families, regardless of income, area or need have access to a health visitor service that will provide a guaranteed level of support to families until their child reaches the age of five; further believes that there needs to be greater flexibility in how parents use their child care entitlement; supports a more flexible mix of state, partnership and private provision of nursery school places, and believes that more information relating to good parenting should be made available to all parents through maternity units, early years settings, GP practices and on NHS websites. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-7923.3 Shona Robison: Early Intervention in Health and Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7923) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;the establishment of the Modernising Nursing in the Community Board, which is working with NHS boards to ensure that community nursing services in Scotland are fit for the 21st century, and further notes the increase in public health nurses/health visitors during the current parliamentary session; supports the current flexible use and mix of state, partnership and private provision of nursery school places in line with local needs and circumstances; welcomes the fact that the vast majority of Scottish local authorities and their partners have local parenting strategies in place, and endorses the current financial support to the leading third sector organisations that provide information and support to parents, including family mediation organisations that provide assistance to families in difficulty.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-7923.2 Des McNulty: Early Intervention in Health and Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7923) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that NHS boards and local authorities working with third sector organisations and volunteers must give children&rsquo;s community services more integrated resources; recognises the valuable role being played by Sure Start and Family Centres and expresses concern regarding the impact of funding reductions on low-income families; further believes that health visitors linked with a GP practice and social workers have a key role to play in assessing, advising and supporting the parents of babies and very young children, especially young mums; welcomes the nurse family partnership pilots but proposes that Health for All Children 4 guidance should now be reviewed; considers that families should be partners in determining how services, including parenting support, should be provided; believes that early education and care is vital in providing a positive start for every child as well as in identifying and overcoming barriers to learning such as poor language and communication skills; believes that, where a child is at risk of neglect or abuse, a strict timeline for intervention is required, and welcomes the pilot being undertaken by Glasgow City Council, ensuring that giving every child the best chance in life as well as the protection of the child are the overriding considerations.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-7923.1 Ross Finnie: Early Intervention in Health and Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7923) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;agrees with the conclusions of the Finance Committee&rsquo;s recent inquiry into preventative spending that the current balance of government spending is skewed too much in favour of reactive, rather than preventative, spending; recognises that early intervention has proven benefits not only in health and education but also in other areas such as crime reduction measures, support for carers and services for older people, and supports a long-term shift to sustained investment in a high-quality, preventative approach to the growing social and economic challenges faced by public services.&quot; </p>
