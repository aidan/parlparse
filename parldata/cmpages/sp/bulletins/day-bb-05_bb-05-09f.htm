That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-2770#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Proposed Closure of Rural and Special Needs Schools in Aberdeenshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals by Aberdeenshire Council to close or amalgamate a number of local schools; recognises the strength of feeling amongst parents and the wider community over the implications of closing those schools, as illustrated by the formation of the Garioch Schools Action Group and other local campaigns; notes in particular the proposal to close St Andrew&rsquo;s school in Inverurie, a school that is widely recognised as providing an excellent educational environment for children with special needs; recognises the opposition to the current proposals by local parents at St Andrew&rsquo;s who are genuinely concerned by the impact some of the options proposed by Aberdeenshire Council will have on their children; notes the ongoing confusion over the exact nature of the local authority&rsquo;s proposals which is causing considerable distress amongst parents; believes that Aberdeenshire Council must make available to parents all the necessary information in relation to all those schools proposed for closure as part of the current consultation process; considers that Aberdeenshire Council should recognise the strength of the arguments put forward by parents and the wider community for the retention of their local schools, and further considers that the Scottish Executive should play what role it can to ensure that Aberdeenshire Council&rsquo;s proposals do not damage the educational welfare of the children and wider interests of the community.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2769</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>National Breastfeeding Awareness Week 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that National Breastfeeding Awareness Week takes place between 8 and 14 May 2005; acknowledges the importance of the week in raising awareness of, and support for, breastfeeding; considers that Scotland has made considerable advances in recent years, including ensuring that 54% of Scottish babies are now born in a UNICEF &quot;Baby Friendly&quot; accredited maternity unit; congratulates health sector professionals who have worked tirelessly to achieve these improvements; considers that the Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005 provides a strong message of support for health professionals, breastfeeding mothers and their babies; recognises, however, that Scotland has failed to reach its target of having 50% of mothers still breastfeeding their babies at six weeks of life by 2005, and considers that this target should be reassessed with a view towards strengthening, and providing greater support for, the national breastfeeding strategy.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-2751</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>International Nurses&rsquo; Day 2005: Patient Safety and Targeting Counterfeit and Substandard Medicines</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament pledges its support for International Nurses&rsquo; Day, which is celebrated around the world every 12 May on the anniversary of Florence Nightingale&rsquo;s birth; notes that the theme for 2005, &quot;Nurses for Patient Safety: Targeting Counterfeit and Substandard Medicines&quot;, is to increase awareness of the existence and consequences of counterfeit medicines which the World Health Organisation estimates make up more than 10% of the global medicines available in the market and are found in both developed and developing countries; further notes that the World Health Organisation also estimates that up to 25% of the medicines used in developing countries are counterfeit or substandard; recognises that nurses are on the front line of health, administering or prescribing medicines and are well positioned to monitor drug effects and side effects; believes that, by choosing this theme for International Nurses&rsquo; Day, the International Council of Nurses highlights the serious threat to patient safety that counterfeit medicines have become, and urges that every effort is made to provide tools to identify counterfeit drugs and to report any suspicious medicines, especially these with improper packaging and labelling.</p>
