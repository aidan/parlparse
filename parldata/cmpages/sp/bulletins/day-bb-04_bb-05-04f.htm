          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1247</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>World Asthma Day - <em>Living on a Knife Edge</em></strong>-That the Parliament notes with great concern the shocking statistics in the report <em>Living on a Knife Edge</em>, published by Asthma UK Scotland;&nbsp;notes that, in particular, there&nbsp;are 400,000 people in Scotland who have asthma, of whom&nbsp;200,000 have serious asthma, including 40,000 people who live in fear that their next asthma attack will be fatal, and welcomes the new Asthma Attack Card produced by Asthma UK Scotland that gives clear advice to help reduce the number of unnecessary deaths.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1246</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Johnstone High School Success</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the team from Johnstone High School who were successful in the Scottish Schools Football Association Senior Shield Final, the oldest recognised schools football tournament in the world, and recognises their outstanding record of sporting achievement which now includes four Scottish cup wins in the last six years.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1245</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Sunday Times &quot;Rich List&quot; and the Redistribution of Wealth</strong>-That the Parliament notes the findings of<em> The Sunday Times </em>annual &quot;Rich List&quot; survey published on 18 April 2004 which exposes the obscene and growing gap in wealth between the richest 1,000 and the ordinary people of Britain; recognises that the richest 1,000 are richer now than at any time in Britain's history and that their wealth has increased by 29.8% over the last 12 months to a collective amount of &pound;202.4 billion, which is up from &pound;115 billion over the last four years, and urgently demands the introduction of radical redistributive tax measures to close the obscene wealth gap in Scotland and fundamentally improve the living standards of the vast majority across Scotland, particularly pensioners and low-paid workers.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1244</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Plaid Cymru Leader's Comments on Draft European Constitution</strong>-That the Parliament notes the comments of Ieuan Wyn Jones, leader of Plaid Cymru, in relation to the draft European Constitution that &quot;This draft new constitution is a charter to tighten the grip of the larger nation states of Europe. The voice of the smaller countries will be reduced, while the needs of stateless nations like Wales or Scotland will be ignored completely&quot; and believes that these comments illustrate clearly that the draft constitution is not in the interests of those in Scotland who believe in democracy, socialism and independence.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1243</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Directors' Salaries and an Equitable Wage Differential</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the pay rises for Britain's 35 best-paid directors averaged 25.9% while average earnings for the economy as a whole increased by only 3.4%; notes that these directors are all paid more than &pound;500,000 a year, with 27 of them paid over &pound;1 million, and believes that these obscene salaries do not represent a fair reward structure within the workplace and that a maximum wage with an initial 1:10 differential between minimum and maximum earnings should be introduced urgently to close the growing and obscene wage gap within Scottish and British workplaces.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1242</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Cost of Invasion and Occupation of Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Her Majesty's Government has spent &pound;6.3 billion on the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq to date and that the cost of maintaining Trident nuclear weapons of mass destruction at Faslane is &pound;1.5 billion a year and believes that these billions spent on illegal war and maintaining weapons of mass destruction would be much better invested in radically improving pensions across the United Kingdom and expanding and improving housing, education and health services for all.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1241</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Withdrawal of Spanish Armed Service Personnel from Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the newly-elected socialist government in Spain for honouring its pre-election promise to the Spanish electorate to withdraw Spanish armed service personnel from Iraq if elected; notes the increased voter turnout that led to the election of the Spanish socialists, and believes that Her Majesty's Government should follow their example by withdrawing all armed service personnel from Iraq in recognition that they are part of an illegal occupation force which took part in an illegal US invasion.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1240</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Chinese Army Invite to Military Tattoo</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the invitation to the Chinese People's Liberation Army&nbsp;(PLA) to attend the Edinburgh Military Tattoo in view of continuing human rights abuses carried out by the Chinese Government, especially in Tibet, and&nbsp;calls on the organisers of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo to retract, as a matter of urgency, the invitation to the band from the PLA to perform given&nbsp;that the invitation will be&nbsp;interpreted as proof that the Scottish people do not care about, or take notice of, the continued repression of the Tibetan and the Chinese people by the PLA at the instigation of the Chinese authorities.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1239#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>World Lupus Day</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates LUPUS UK, the national charity for lupus sufferers, on its involvement in World Lupus Day which takes place on 10 May 2004; notes that its participation in this event aims to publicise the illness lupus, an auto immune disease which is currently incurable and, although less well-known, appears to be more common worldwide than leukaemia, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy; further notes that lupus can be life-threatening and adversely affects the lives of sufferers, and hopes that World Lupus Day is successful in raising awareness of this illness.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1238#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>STUC and Advertising in Schools</strong>-That the Parliament notes the motion passed at the Scottish Trades Union Congress in April 2004, &quot;That this Congress calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce legislation to ban all advertising and branding aimed at school students both within primary and secondary schools&quot;; believes that the teaching and learning environment should be free from corporate advertising and devoted to educational materials, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should prohibit the promotion of brand names and commercial companies through sponsorship and advertising in Scotland's schools.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1237#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Thrive Scotland Exhibition</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the exhibition being held by the national horticultural charity, Thrive Scotland, in the Parliament foyer from 14 June 2004; recognises that Thrive exists to enable disadvantaged, disabled and older people to participate fully in the social and economic life of the community and that it supports a network of specialist projects that run programmes of horticultural activity for training and employment, therapy and health, and commends Thrive Scotland for its commitment to the needs of some of those who are most disadvantaged in the community, particularly people with mental health problems, learning difficulties, ex-offenders, substance abusers, people with physical health difficulties and the very old.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1236</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Europe Day - 9 May 2004</strong>-That the Parliament is proud to mark Europe Day as a celebration of the founding of the European Union (EU); endorses the fundamental principles of the EU as set out in the declaration by Robert Schumann on 9 May 1950; welcomes the contribution that the EU has made towards peace and solidarity across Europe; agrees that enlargement on 1 May 2004 represents a historic moment in our European history; acknowledges that the principles on which the EU was originally founded are now more important than ever; extends the hand of friendship to the 10 accession states, and encourages the people of Scotland to join the citizens of Europe in the celebration of our common values on Europe Day.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1235#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Space Invaders</strong>-That the Parliament notes the difficulties experienced by people within local communities who have secured disabled parking spaces outside their homes; deplores the fact that these spaces can become a focus of conflict within communities where people seek to use such a space, despite not having a disabled parking badge; notes with equal dismay the figures published by the Baywatch campaign group that show that over 20% of disabled parking bays in supermarket car parks are being used by non-disabled drivers; recognises that the current legal position, which distinguishes between courtesy parking spaces and those supported by traffic regulation orders, creates problems for people with disabilities who need to rely on a designated parking space outside their home; appreciates, in the case of car parks on private land such as those belonging to supermarkets, the frustration of disabled drivers where the store management appears reluctant to enforce its own parking policy; acknowledges that, for their part, some store managers are not clear about their powers to compel drivers to move from specially designated bays; notes that this situation leaves supermarkets vulnerable to future legal action under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended); therefore believes that the Scottish Executive, local authorities and all relevant agencies should work together to develop an awareness campaign to highlight the rights of disabled people and to emphasise the unacceptability of harassing those who have been allocated disabled parking spaces, and considers that, if a satisfactory solution cannot be found, the possibility of legislating to address the problem and giving local authorities the appropriate enforcement powers should be examined.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Johann Lamont, Scott Barrie, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Dr Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong>, Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Mike Watson<strong>*</strong></P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1233</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Borders Cancerline for Welfare Benefits Advice</strong>-That the Parliament applauds the work of Borders Cancerline for Welfare Benefits Advice, a partnership between Macmillan Cancer Relief and the Disablement Income Group Scotland, which commenced at the beginning of April and provides a dedicated telephone helpline for those affected by cancer and their carers in the Borders, giving access to professionally trained staff with an understanding of cancer, its treatments and effects, a personal adviser to provide support and guidance through the complex process of claiming relevant benefits and help in completing claim forms by phone, and urges the Scottish Executive to support all similar projects which can have only positive benefits, both emotional and financial, for people at a very vulnerable time in their lives.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1232</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Draft Health Professions (Operating Department Practitioners and Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2004</strong>-That the Health Committee recommends that the draft Health Professions (Operating Department Practitioners and Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2004 be approved.</P>

          <P>Supported by: Tavish Scott</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1230</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Latin American Plantation Bananas</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that use of pesticides, including paraquat, on plantation bananas in Latin America is more than 20 times greater than average pesticide use on crops in industrialised countries with corresponding levels of worker exposure to pesticides and illnesses; further notes the lack of compliance with international labour standards, including the right to unionise and the right to safety protection for workers, in these Latin American countries, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to put pressure on the World Trade Organisation to force countries growing plantation bananas to reduce pesticides usage and improve workers' rights as a matter of urgency.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1229#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Competitive School Sport</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Johnstone High School and the Nicholson Institute for being finalists in the 101st Bank of Scotland Senior Shield Final; applauds the commitment and determination they showed in reaching the final; recognises the importance of having young sportsmen and women competing at the highest possible levels of competition, given the current state of many of our major sports, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that school sport is made a priority so that children are able to enjoy competitive sport at the highest levels and that more time is given in the curriculum to sport in general in Scotland's schools.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Murdo Fraser</P>

          <P>Supported by: Margaret Jamieson, Jackie Baillie, Robert Brown, Sarah Boyack, Mr Kenneth Macintosh, Dr Elaine Murray, Mr Jamie Stone, Bristow Muldoon, Mike Pringle, Nora Radcliffe, Mr Alasdair Morrison, Cathy Peattie, Dr Sylvia Jackson, George Lyon, Karen Gillon, Ms Wendy Alexander<strong>*</strong>, Mike Watson<strong>*</strong>, Mr Duncan McNeil<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1227</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Unseen</strong>-That the Parliament notes the report by the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB), <em>Unseen - Neglect, isolation and household poverty amongst older people with sight loss,</em> of March 2004; notes that nine out of 10 blind and partially-sighted people are aged 60 and over and that the recurring theme in the survey is that people in older age groups were poorer and less likely to have received services designed to help them live independently and safely and, in particular, that in the area of support and care only 48% have received a home assessment, only 32% were aware of mobility training and only 46% of the social services rehabilitation service; notes that only 37% had been offered a cooker sticker and 47% a liquid level indicator; notes that 74% have an income below &pound;195 per week with only 20% aware of extra expenses available for sight loss, and therefore supports the RNIB's recommendations that every person with sight loss is offered an assessment of needs, suitable services and suitable tools so that they can live independently and with dignity, that attendance allowance should be automatically available to all registered blind and partially-sighted people and that Her Majesty's Government should issue benefit take-up targets and fund advocacy for take-up projects as part of a drive to ensure that benefits reach all entitled to them.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1226</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Independent Clinical Research Trials</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent report published by the Scottish Association for Mental Health, <em>All you need to know?

          <P><strong>S2M-1225</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Commemoration of Chernobyl Accident</strong>-That the Parliament notes that it is 18 years since the nuclear accident at Chernobyl occurred; further notes the terrible legacy in those countries most directly affected, namely Belarus, Ukraine and Russia; congratulates Scottish charities and civic organisations for their outstanding work in supporting individuals and communities affected, and recognises the need to take national and international action to avoid the possibility of future environmental catastrophes.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1224</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Imprisonment of Kurdish MPs in Turkey</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the decision taken on 21 April 2004 to confirm the 15-year prison sentence handed down to the Kurdish MPs Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Selim Sadak and Orhan Dogan by a state security court in Turkey for speaking Kurdish in the Turkish Parliament in 1994; notes that this verdict gives rise to serious concern in light of the European Union's political criteria and casts a negative shadow on the implementation of political reforms in Turkey; considers that this verdict is an insult to the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights which had ordered a retrial; further notes that Leyla Zana is a recipient of the European Parliament's Sakharov prize for freedom and that the four are considered &quot;prisoners of conscience&quot; by Amnesty International and have been referred to as political prisoners by the European Commission, and calls on the Turkish Government to release these prisoners immediately and halt the persecution of Kurdish representatives for trying to uphold their Kurdish identity.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1222</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Agenda for Change</strong>-That the Parliament notes the concerns expressed by, amongst others, UNISON's national health conference with regard to Agenda for Change; further notes that &quot;early implementers&quot; are reporting up to 30% of NHS staff facing inferior terms and conditions following application of the job evaluation system even before taking account of loss of unsocial hours payments; believes that NHS staff in general deserve greater recognition and pay; further believes that no NHS staff member should lose out as a result of Agenda for Change and that the Scottish Executive will have to make significant amendments to the current proposals if it is to avoid large sections of the NHS workforce rejecting Agenda for Change, and urges the Executive to take immediate action to avoid the prospect of a protracted dispute by making immediate moves to address all concerns raised.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Frances Curran, Tommy Sheridan, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1221</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Identity Cards</strong>-That the Parliament notes the Partnership Agreement commitment to evaluate the local pilot projects in order to assess the desirability of creating a national voluntary citizen's entitlement card for appropriate public services, taking care to protect individual privacy; welcomes previous commitments by the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government that identity cards will not be compulsory for accessing devolved services; supports measures that will genuinely help reduce the threat of terrorism and tackle crime and benefit fraud; believes that it is not proven that identity cards will achieve this, and calls on the Executive not to give Scottish police officers the legal right to demand proof of identity without cause.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1215</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Hate Crime Against Disabled People</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the recent Disability Rights Commission (DRC) and Capability Scotland report, <em>Hate Crime Against Disabled People in Scotland: A Survey Report</em>; deplores the fact that significant numbers of disabled people endure sometimes repeated criminal acts motivated by prejudice, such as intimidation, threats and even physical violence; notes the high level of support for a change in the law to combat crimes motivated by prejudice and malice against disabled people, and calls on the Working Group on Hate Crime, convened by the Scottish Executive, to take the findings of the DRC and Capability Scotland report fully into account when considering responses to its current consultation.</P>
