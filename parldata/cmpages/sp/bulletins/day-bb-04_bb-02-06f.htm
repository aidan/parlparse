          <p><strong>*S2M-880</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Miss 
            X: Chief Inspector of Social Work Report</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern that following the conviction of James Mercer, 
            Alexander Maben and Ross Douglas in July 2002 of serious assaults 
            on Miss X, there have been three reports into Scottish Borders Council 
            Social Work Department&#8217;s handling of the case, the Stallard 
            Report, published in October 2002, the Black Report, published in 
            June 2003 and the Bates Report, published in September 2003 and that 
            thereafter the Minister for Education and Young People announced an 
            inspection of the case by the Chief Inspector of Social Work on 13 
            June 2003; further notes that the final report with recommendations 
            was sent to Scottish Borders Council on 21 November 2003 and according 
            to the council returned to the inspectorate in December 2003; notes 
            that since December 2003 several senior managers in the council&#8217;s 
            Social Work Department with involvement in the case have negotiated 
            early retirement packages which would see them leave their positions 
            by March/April 2004 and therefore, in all the above circumstances, 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to inquire of the Chief Inspector 
            of Social Work the reasons for the delay in publication, with a view 
            to securing publication now.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-879</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Hydro 
            Aluminium Extrusion</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes with 
            regret the decision by Hydro Aluminium Extrusion Ltd (HAE) of Sanquhar 
            to close in July 2004 with the loss of 76 jobs if no alternative can 
            be identified; further notes the vital importance of medium-sized 
            companies such as HAE to the local economies of areas such as Upper 
            Nithsdale and the devastating effect which the loss of 76 jobs will 
            have on the community, given the poor transport and IT links which 
            exist in that part of the Dumfries and Galloway region, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to bring forward specific proposals for 
            improving the A76 in order to increase the competitiveness and sustainability 
            of those companies which depend on that route.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-878</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Death 
            of Ron Thompson</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes with deep 
            sadness the death of the much admired journalist Ron Thompson who, 
            for over fifty years, dedicated his life to the media; recognises 
            his great contribution to journalism through the <em>Dundee Courier, 
            Daily Herald, Sunday Mail</em> and <em>Sunday Express</em> and his 
            outstanding record as an interviewer with Grampian TV, and extends 
            its sympathy to his wife Mima and son Alastair.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-877#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Livestock 
            Improvement Scheme</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament recognises the 
            considerable success over the last few years of the Livestock Improvement 
            Scheme and, in particular, the Bull Hire Scheme in providing quality 
            bulls to crofters at reasonable prices; notes with concern changes 
            to the scheme that will require crofters to pay in advance for bull 
            hire and wintering costs; fears that these changes will deter crofters 
            from obtaining high quality bulls with quality assurance and thus 
            run against the committed aims of both the Scottish Executive Environment 
            and Rural Affairs Department and the Crofters Commission of increasing 
            the quality of the Scottish beef herd, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should improve the efficiency of the current scheme rather 
            than introducing upfront payments for bull hire that would put a severe 
            financial strain on scheme members.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-876</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The 
            Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) 
            (West Coast) (No. 2) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&#8212;That the 
            Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) 
            (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No. 2) (Scotland) Order 
            2004 (SSI 2004/43) be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-875#</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Palliative 
            Care in Scotland</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament congratulates 
            the initiative of overnight palliative care nurses in Lanarkshire 
            that enables patients with end-stage cancer to be cared for and die 
            at home if that is their wish; recognises the value this work brings 
            to the lives of vulnerable people and their families and the efforts 
            made to take a multi-disciplinary approach; believes that this will 
            encourage a culture of cooperation rather than competition; recognises 
            the need for similar schemes to be rolled out across Scotland while 
            having regard to the different needs in different parts of Scotland, 
            and notes the gaps in the system which need to be addressed such as 
            care for adolescents who do not fall under the care of either adult 
            or paediatric specialists.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-874</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Scottish Community Drama Association</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            recognises the considerable contribution made to community arts throughout 
            Scotland by the Scottish Community Drama Association (SCDA); notes 
            the key role played by SCDA in fostering the development of new dramatic 
            talent; profoundly regrets the decision by the Scottish Arts Council 
            to withdraw SCDA&#8217;s core funding of &#163;50,000, and calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to secure the reinstatement of funding to ensure 
            that the excellent, value for money service provided by SCDA is supported 
            and made secure.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-873</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Millennium 
            Development Goals</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament welcomes the 
            commitment of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government to the Millennium Development 
            Goals and to increase its aid budget to 0.4% of its GDP by 2006; notes 
            with concern, however, that the United Nations (UN), the World Bank 
            and others have warned that these goals, which include the goal of 
            reducing by 50% the number of people in the world who live in absolute 
            poverty by 2015, will not be met without significantly increased development 
            assistance; congratulates Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands 
            and Luxembourg for achieving the UN aid budget target of 0.7% of their 
            respective GDPs; welcomes the commitment of Ireland, Belgium and France 
            in setting clear timetables for reaching that target by 2007, 2010 
            and 2012 respectively, and believes that Her Majesty&#8217;s Government 
            should follow the example of these countries and likewise commit to 
            the UN aid budget target.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-872</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Homelessness 
            in East Lothian</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the findings of the Pathfinder Inspection Report in January 2004 regarding 
            the performance of East Lothian Council in its functions as a social 
            landlord, particularly in relation to its homelessness obligations; 
            further notes the indictment of services delivered to homeless people, 
            that the council (a) operates a quota system for the allocation of 
            re-lets to homeless people so that only one in four is so allocated, 
            <strong></strong>resulting in a high number of households being placed 
            in bed and breakfast accommodation for &quot;significant periods of 
            time&quot;, (b) is failing to offer any accommodation to a small number 
            of households to whom it owes a statutory duty, and (c) could not 
            provide inspectors with reliable figures on the provision of permanent 
            accommodation for homeless people; recognises that the report recommends, 
            <em>inter alia</em> that the council (a) provides access to suitable 
            temporary accommodation for all homeless people to whom it has a duty, 
            (b) must publish a policy setting out its rules for allocating houses 
            to homeless people to whom it has a duty and ensure that that policy 
            complies with statutory requirements, and (c) should ensure that homeless 
            applicants are always referred to an appropriate officer for assessment 
            and that any discussion of an applicant&#8217;s circumstances is appropriate, 
            adequate and is conducted in private; further notes that the report 
            found &quot;a general lack of enthusiasm on the part of the council 
            to consider any change to its current approach to the allocation of 
            permanent accommodation to homeless people&quot;, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive, as a matter of some urgency, to take appropriate 
            steps to ensure that the council complies with its statutory obligations 
            in the interests of the vulnerable homeless people in East Lothian.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-871</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>End 
            to Nursery Nurses Pay Dispute in Stirling</strong>&#8212;That the 
            Parliament welcomes the announcement that nursery nurses in Stirling 
            are to end their industrial action following an agreement over pay 
            with Stirling Council; notes that as a result they will take no further 
            part in the national pay dispute; believes local bargaining of this 
            nature is best for all stakeholders involved, and commends it to other 
            parts of Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, Murdo 
            Fraser<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-870#</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> 
            <strong>The Institute for Science Education in Scotland</strong>&#8212;That 
            the Parliament notes the widespread concerns about the future of science 
            education in Scotland; believes the declining popularity of science 
            subjects in schools and at further and higher education levels has 
            consequences for economic development; welcomes the establishment 
            of the Institute for Science Education in Scotland, a unique network 
            of scientists working with science teachers to support excellence 
            in science teaching throughout Scotland; notes that the aim of the 
            institute is to work with the thousands of people in the Scottish 
            science community who are determined to reverse the decline in the 
            popularity of science at schools, colleges and universities; further 
            notes the priority set by the Scottish Science Advisory Committee 
            in its recent report, <em>Why Science Education Matters</em>, on development 
            of the institute; notes that the institute has the support of all 
            Scotland&#8217;s universities, the Royal Society of Edinburgh and 
            the General Teaching Council for Scotland; further notes the creation 
            of a National Centre for Excellence in Science Education in England 
            with support from the Wellcome Trust and the Department for Education 
            and Skills, and considers that the Scottish Executive should support 
            the development of the institute.</p>
