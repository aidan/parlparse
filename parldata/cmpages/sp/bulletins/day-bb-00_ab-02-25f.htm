    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-592#</b> <strong>Mr John Munro: Council Tax Reduction for Second Homes in
    Ross, Skye and Inverness West</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses concern that
    non-residents of Ross, Skye and Inverness West are entitled to a reduction in council tax
    on their second homes; notes that this places an additional burden on local residents and
    supports the view that Highland council should have discretionary powers to waive this
    reduction. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-591#</b> <strong>Ian Jenkins: Public Participation in Planning</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that many individuals and communities feel frustrated and
    disenfranchised when they seem unable to have any influence on planning decisions which
    affect their lives, and expresses its wish to see amendments to the planning regulations
    which would address these concerns, for example in cases such as have recently arisen in
    the Scottish Borders and Midlothian. </p>
