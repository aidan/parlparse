          <p><strong>*S2M-1117</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>The 
            Failure of the BBC to Hand Over Tapes to the Fraser Inquiry</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees that the Holyrood Project has a significant 
            contribution to make to the built environment in Scotland and should 
            provide important lessons for future public procurement policy; notes 
            that the report of the Holyrood Inquiry being conducted by The Rt 
            Hon The Lord Fraser of Carmyllie QC, when presented to the Parliament, 
            will be submitted to an appropriate Parliamentary committee for additional 
            scrutiny and may thereafter be the subject of a full debate or debates 
            in the Parliament; believes that consideration of the Holyrood Inquiry 
            report and the public policy issues arising therefrom which are the 
            general responsibility of the Scottish Executive would be enhanced 
            if members had available to them recordings or transcripts of interviews 
            given by the late Donald Dewar and Snr Enric Miralles to the production 
            company, Wark Clements, in the making of the programme entitled &quot;The 
            Gathering Place&quot;, which documents are in the custody or under 
            the control of the British Broadcasting Corporation having its principal 
            place of business in Scotland at Broadcasting House, Queen Margaret 
            Drive, Glasgow G12 8DG, and accordingly requires the British Broadcasting 
            Corporation in terms of section 23 of the Scotland Act 1998 to deliver 
            such documents to the Clerk of the Parliament in accordance with instructions 
            to be given by him in terms of section 24 of said Act.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1116</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>The 
            Effect of Strip Stamps on the Whisky Industry</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the Scottish Executive's commitment to the Scotch Whisky 
            industry as set out in <em>A Toast to the Future - working together 
            for Scotch whisky</em>, particularly the Executive's commitment to 
            a fair tax regime for the industry; notes with disappointment the 
            announcement by Her Majesty's Government in the 2004 Budget of the 
            introduction of tax stamps on whisky and other spirits; recognises 
            that the compliance costs associated with the measure will introduce 
            a heavy burden on the Scotch whisky industry, thereby adversely affecting 
            both it and the wider Scottish economy; believes that the £3 million 
            compensation package announced by HM Treasury is wholly inadequate, 
            given the estimated cost to the industry of some £60 to £70 million 
            per annum, and accordingly calls on Her Majesty's Government to reverse 
            the decision to impose tax stamps and, failing this, to ensure that 
            a properly-funded and comprehensive package of measures is put in 
            place to minimise the damage caused to the industry.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1115#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Promoting 
            Regional and Minority Languages of Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the deliberations of the Shetland dialect conference held 
            recently in Scalloway; notes the bearing on these deliberations of 
            recommendations under the current review of the obligations of the 
            Scottish Executive to meet its pledge to promote Scots under the European 
            Charter for Regional or Minority Languages; further notes that this 
            must include creating conditions for the use of Scots in public life, 
            through the adoption of a language policy and concrete measures, in 
            co-operation with the speakers of the language, and considers that 
            Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should 
            make a commitment to a thorough and explicit adherence to the spirit 
            and letter of this review.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1114</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Keep 
            the Flying Scotsman in the UK</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            the Flying Scotsman steam locomotive has been put up for sale with 
            the bidding process ending on 2 April 2004; is concerned that it may 
            be sold abroad if £2 million is not raised; congratulates the National 
            Railway Museum in York and Sir Richard Branson for finding a substantial 
            amount of money for a bid; notes that recently the Scottish Executive 
            gave £6.5 million for the John Murray Manuscript Archive; considers 
            the Flying Scotsman also to be of significant national value to Scotland, 
            given that it was the first locomotive to run from London to Edinburgh 
            non-stop; calls on the Executive to make a contribution to the bid, 
            and hopes that this will keep the locomotive in the United Kingdom 
            and allow it to be seen regularly on the Scottish railway network.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1113#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Amnesty 
            International's Campaign to Stop Violence Against Women</strong>-That 
            the Parliament commends the recent decision of Amnesty International 
            to conduct a sustained campaign to stop violence against women; agrees 
            with Amnesty International that violence against women is deeply embedded 
            in all nations, including our own and that it is found in all social 
            classes, irrespective of income, education or religion; notes with 
            serious concern the prevailing incidence of domestic violence and 
            other forms of violence against women in Scotland; reminds the Scottish 
            Executive, local authorities and the police forces of their legal 
            and moral obligations to protect women from violence, and considers 
            that the Executive should do all in its power to eliminate this vile 
            abuse of human rights in Scotland and to assist, where it can, the 
            international campaign to stop violence against women.</P>
