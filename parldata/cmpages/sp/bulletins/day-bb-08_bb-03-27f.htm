<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1649</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>St Timothy&rsquo;s Primary School, A Class Act</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Timothy&rsquo;s School, Carntyne, Glasgow, on achieving the city&rsquo;s best-ever inspection report for a primary school after receiving six &quot;excellent&quot; ratings from HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE); notes that, despite Carntyne being one of Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived areas, St Timothy&rsquo;s School has now been recognised as being among the best schools in the country; commends the great work done by staff, pupils and the local community, and believes that St Timothy&rsquo;s serves as an example to all schools throughout Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1648</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Children&rsquo;s Commissioner Report on Age of Leaving Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the <em>Sweet 16?:</em> <em>Age of Leaving Care in Scotland</em> report produced by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland which was laid before the Parliament on 25 March 2008; recognises that young people in care are probably the most disadvantaged group in Scotland today; supports in particular the Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendations that proper care should normally continue until the age of 18 with appropriate support thereafter and the need for a culture change to make this a reality; is appalled at the continued use in some areas of bed and breakfast accommodation or homeless hostels for young care-leavers; recognises the importance of the corporate parent concept of the local authority and the community more generally, and calls on the Scottish Government to act to take forward the recommendations on an urgent basis to ensure that young people leaving care are properly and appropriately supported in accordance with their wishes, needs and maturity, and in a way which gives a stable foundation for their future lives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1647</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Scottish Labour MPs Fail to Represent Constituents&rsquo; Concerns</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the actions of Scottish Labour MPs in voting against an inquiry into the war on Iraq by an independent committee, particularly Glasgow MPs John Robertson, Ann McKechin and Mohammad Sarwar who despite voting against the Iraq war in 2003, voted on 25 March 2008 against holding an independent inquiry into the UK Government&rsquo;s conduct in the run up to and during the war itself; believes that these MPs&rsquo; views do not represent the views of the Scottish people and therefore could be seen to constitute a dereliction of their duties in representing the interests of their constituents, and further believes this to be another example of disingenuous representation of their views by Glasgow Labour MPs, given their public declarations against the post office closures while voting with the UK Government to close post offices and their subsequent failure to vote to stop the closures.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1646</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Companies Act 2006 (Scottish public sector companies to be audited by the Auditor General for Scotland) Order 2008 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1645&diams; </strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Sweet 16?: The Age of Leaving Care in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the <em>Sweet 16?</em> report by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland into the age of leaving care; expresses concern that while law and policy strongly advise that young people should be encouraged and supported to stay in care until 18 years of age where their welfare requires it, and that some local authorities such as North Lanarkshire are making welcome progress in achieving that objective, Scottish Government statistics show that eight times as many young people leave care at 16 as leave at 18; notes that as a result many young people encounter problems with paying bills, alcohol and drugs, continuing education and homelessness; believes that this is unacceptable, and recognises the merits of the report&rsquo;s recommendations to change the culture that assumes 16 as the age for leaving care so ensuring that in the future no young person feels pressurised to leave care before they are ready, that proper care until 18 is a right for all, that support continues to be available during the transition to independence, that the destinations and outcomes for young people leaving care are properly monitored and thatall young people in care, in Airdrie and Shotts and across Scotland<strong>,</strong> receive the support, advice and information about their rights and options for the future that they require.</p>
<p>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1644</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Scottish Action Against Council Tax</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the support of the Scottish Action Against Council Tax campaign for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on local income tax; notes that the campaign believes that a local income tax Bill &quot;should not be turned into a political football&quot; and that &quot;obstructing the introduction of a local income tax shows contempt for the wishes of the Scottish people&quot;, and calls on members from all parties to respect the campaign&rsquo;s appeal &quot;to all fair minded political parties and MSPs not to let Scotland down in this respect&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1643&diams; </strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Bevin Boys</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the long overdue recognition by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government of the Bevin Boys for their role during the Second World War; appreciates the vital contribution that they made to the war effort in the pits of Fife and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and expresses profound regret that this recognition comes 62 years after the war ended and that many of the Bevin Boys have not lived to see their sacrifices acknowledged.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1642</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>United Nations World Autism Awareness Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the first UN World Autism Awareness Day on 2 April 2008; encourages the UK Government to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; supports fully the Convention&rsquo;s commitments to combating prejudice and raising awareness of the capabilities and contributions of disabled people, including those with autism; further recognises that there is a lack of widespread awareness that autism affects one in 100 people in the United Kingdom; believes that all public, private and voluntary sector organisations should strive to serve the needs of people with autism; calls for greater understanding so that people with autism can enjoy the same rights and freedoms as everyone in society, and signals its firm commitment to supporting those with this complex, lifelong and often very serious condition by supporting the ratification of the UN Convention.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1640</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Scotstoun Primary Eco School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the work done by the pupils and staff of Scotstoun Primary School, Glasgow, in gaining their Eco Schools Bronze award, which has seen the establishment of an eco committee known as &quot;The Eco Kidz&quot; made up of pupils from primaries one to seven, parents, school staff and members of the local community who meet regularly to decide future action plans aimed at promoting a greater awareness of sustainability and ecology; notes that the current action plan is focused around the issue of recycling and has seen the school introduce a number of measures to encourage recycling, such as fruit bins in every class and composting in the garden, paper bins in every class and rag bag collections where parents and residents are asked to bring in unwanted clothes which are then reused or recycled; further notes the hugely successful Christmas tree recycling scheme initiated by the pupils in response to seeing many trees discarded in their local community; believes that the care and commitment shown by all those involved at Scotstoun Primary is invaluable in tackling and raising awareness of  the many environmental challenges we face, and wishes the pupils continuing success as they work towards the Eco Schools Silver award.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1639</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>4,000th American Military Death in Iraq</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regretfully notes the death of the 4,000th American soldier in Iraq and expresses its condolences to all those who have lost loved ones in the conflict, be they military personnel or civilians; reiterates its support for a full, public and independent inquiry at the earliest possible opportunity into the decision to go to war, and calls on government at all levels in the United Kingdom to work for a speedy and peaceful end to the hostilities.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1627*#*</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>MS Awareness Week 21-27 April 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the focus on the emotional, physical and financial costs of multiple sclerosis of this year&rsquo;s MS Awareness Week which runs from 21 to 27 April 2008; recognises that Scotland has the highest rate of the condition in the world and that its costs can be significant for the approximately 10,500 people living with multiple sclerosis in Scotland as they deal with the impact that it can have on every aspect of their lives; supports the work that the MS Society Scotland does to provide advice, support and information to people affected by MS, and recognises that, while considerable progress has been made in the provision of MS specialists in NHS boards, the statutory services available to people affected by MS remain variable across the country and that social care services in particular need to improve so that high-quality support is available wherever people live in Scotland.</p>
