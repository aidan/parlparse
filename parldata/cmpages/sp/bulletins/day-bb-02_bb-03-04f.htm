          <p><strong>*S1M-2822#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Sale and Use of 
            Fireworks</strong>-That the Parliament notes the results of the survey 
            carried out by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
            to Animals in which almost 98% of people supported tighter restrictions 
            on the availability of fireworks; recognises that there has been a 
            large increase in the problems caused for both people and animals 
            by the irresponsible use of fireworks; is concerned that the voluntary 
            code of practice for the sale of fireworks is frequently disregarded, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should do everything in 
            its power to tighten up on the regulations relating to the sale and 
            use of fireworks and, in particular, should review the powers available 
            to local authorities in respect of vendor licensing.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2821#</strong> <strong>John Scott: Strategic Approach 
            to the Development and Protection of Scottish Coastal Waters</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the need for the development of an integrated 
            strategic approach to the sustainable development and protection of 
            Scotland's coastal waters and marine environment, with particular 
            regard to fishing, fish farming, wave and tidal power generation and 
            the protection of identifiably unique Scottish marine habitats.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2820</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Funding for

            welcomes the Scottish Executive's announcement of £4.8 million funding 
            for the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park; recognises the 
            social, economic and environmental benefits that the park will bring 
            to the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs area, much of which lies in Stirling 
            constituency, and congratulates Scottish Ministers for listening to 
            the concerns of local people and working with all involved to provide 
            a funding package that will allow Scotland's first national park to 
            flourish.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2819#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield: North Lanarkshire 
            Council - COSLA Award</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the 
            devastating effect that anti-social behaviour can have on communities 
            across Scotland; congratulates North Lanarkshire Council on winning 
            the COSLA award for top performing authority in customer focus for 
            its work in establishing an anti-social behaviour taskforce which 
            has dealt with over 300 cases since its inception in January 2001, 
            and believes that this example of good practice should be extended 
            throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2818#</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell: Regeneration</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises that a lack of appropriate jobs is a major 
            problem in Scotland; notes that a main cause is the decline of heavy 
            industry in the past three decades; considers that all local authorities, 
            MSPs and key agencies should work together to implement a regeneration 
            programme, and believes that the Scottish Executive should provide 
            resources for its speedy completion.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2817</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Labour Administration 
            of Aberdeen City Council</strong>-That the Parliament condemns Aberdeen 
            City Council's Labour administration for its flagrant disregard of 
            the citizens of the city by voting to (a) allow the Lord Provost to 
            continue to take a friend on overseas trips, (b) close the Grandholm 
            Bridge, which will once again bring gridlock to the city and (c) abolish 
            the meals-on-wheels service and replace it with a fortnightly frozen 
            food delivery and, in light of these contemptuous actions, calls on 
            the council's Labour administration to resign immediately.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2815</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow University 
            Student Accommodation Sell Off</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the plans of the University of Glasgow to sell off over 
            half of its student accommodation to a private housing association; 
            further notes the concerns of students with regard to resulting rent 
            increases, the lack of consultation with student bodies on campus 
            and their exclusion from key talks on the issue; believes that this 
            can only result in increased hardship for students already burdened 
            with debt from loans and tuition fees, and therefore calls on the 
            University of Glasgow to reconsider the decision to sell off its student 
            accommodation.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2814</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Sun-Tanning Parlours</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern recent reports linking the operation 
            of sun-tanning parlours with criminal activities; further notes the 
            recent proliferation of such parlours particularly in Glasgow; urges 
            the Scottish Executive to instigate an immediate investigation into 
            the operation of sun-tanning parlours, and calls for a moratorium 
            on the operation of sun-tanning parlours until such an investigation 
            has been completed.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2813</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: New Housing Partnership</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the motion passed by Labour-controlled Renfrewshire 
            Council whereby the council fully supports the retention of its housing 
            stock, supports the tenants' position that debt associated with the 
            council's houses should be written off without the need to transfer 
            ownership of housing stock, endorses the recommendations contained 
            within the Board Report and seeks an early meeting with Ministers 
            in order to develop options for retaining the housing stock within 
            council ownership with affordable rent levels, whilst delivering the 
            repairs and improvements identified within its consultant's report; 
            congratulates Renfrewshire Council for adopting SNP policy, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's 
            Government in order to ensure that funds are available to write off 
            the housing debt for councils that do not opt for housing stock transfer 
            in order to ensure that they are able to carry out any repairs needed.</p>

            MacDonald, Mr Gil Paterson, Christine Grahame, Brian Adam, Mr Adam 
            Ingram</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2812</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil: Euro 2008</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the announcement that the Scottish Football 
            Association and the Football Association of Ireland are to launch 
            a joint bid to host the Euro 2008 football championships; notes that 
            every major party in the Parliament has, at least in the past if not 
            at present, supported such a joint bid; further notes the potential 
            of the bid to bring all the benefits for tourism and the economy that 
            would have resulted from a solo bid by Scotland without burdening 
            the country with four expensive and unneeded 30,000-seater stadiums; 
            looks forward to the opportunity of working and renewing ties with 
            our Irish neighbours, and urges the whole country to back the bid.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2811</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Spike Milligan 1918-2002</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Spike Milligan at the 
            age of 83; recognises his extraordinary contribution to the development 
            of satire, the extensive contribution he made in support of a large 
            number of charities and campaigning organisations including Greenpeace, 
            Friends of the Earth and the Society for the Preservation of Victorian 
            Lamposts; further notes that he was fiercely against fox hunting, 
            and conveys its sympathy to all of his family.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2810</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Code of Conduct 
            for Members of the Scottish Parliament: Confidentiality</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees to amend the <em>Code of Conduct for Members

            9.4 as set out in Annex D of the Standards Committee's 8th Report 
            2001, <em>Report on the Investigation of Unauthorised Disclosures</em>.</p>

            People in the Scottish Borders and the Waterside Fitness Club, Jedburgh</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the representatives from the Scottish 
            Borders who will be taking part in the World Special Olympics in Dublin 
            in 2003, namely badminton players Ronald Young, Graeme Lang and Steven 
            George, swimmer Alan German, Gordon Yule the UK badminton coach and 
            Jed Renilson the Assistant Head of Delegation; notes with concern 
            that Jedburgh swimming pool is currently under threat of closure due 
            to the £5.9 million cuts by Scottish Borders Council's administration 
            at a time when athletes from all over the Borders attend the pool 
            for Special Olympics Regional Squad sessions on a weekly basis and 
            that the pool is essential not only for those athletes, but the entire 
            community, with swimming lessons taking place Monday to Saturday with 
            16 classes and 10 pupils to a class, disabled lessons with 1 to 1 
            tuition and waiting lists for all swimming lessons, parent and baby 
            classes, fun sessions for children and crash swimming courses; further 
            notes that the pool is used by over 600 pupils per week from the primary 
            schools Parkside, Howdenburn, Hobkirk, Keilder/Bryness, Glendouglas, 
            Jedburgh Grammar, Earlston High and Howdenburn School House Special 
            Needs with disabled dippers' groups, community education group canoeing, 
            Jedburgh Rugby Football Club and Women's Borders Aid also as user 
            groups, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that this 
            essential community facility does not close. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2808</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Ratification of the 
            Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 
            on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes that Her Majesty's Government has not yet ratified 
            the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 
            on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict; notes the interest 
            of this Parliament in protecting the rights of children; believes 
            that children under 18 are entitled to the protection of the safeguards 
            in the Protocol, and urges Her Majesty's Government to ratify the 
            Protocol as soon as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2807</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Lack of General 
            Practitioner in Helmsdale</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the 
            recent decision by Highland NHS Board not to seek a replacement general 
            practitioner for Helmsdale; notes the negative impact which this will 
            have on the local community; condemns the Board's consultation process 
            as deeply flawed; deplores the fact that some residents must now have 
            to travel up to fifty miles for the services of a GP, and calls upon 
            the Scottish Executive to do all it can to ensure that a GP is appointed 
            in Helmsdale as soon as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2805</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Edinburgh Institute

            notes the publication of the annual newsletter of the Edinburgh Institute 
            for the Study of the Arab World and Islam and congratulates it on 
            the accomplishment of 250 years of teaching Arabic and Islamic Studies 
            in Scotland; believes that it is a tribute to the University of Edinburgh 
            that the department has been awarded a five star rating in the recent 
            Research Assessment Exercise, and wishes it every success in attracting 
            more students to these studies.</p>

            Piping</strong>-That the Parliament notes with pleasure the recent 
            £300,000 end of year flexibility grant to the Piping Centre in Glasgow; 
            regrets, however, that once again the College of Piping, which has 
            been in existence since 1944, currently has more than 150 pupils on 
            its register and maintains a teaching network covering the whole of 
            Scotland, has failed to receive similar support, and therefore calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to consider distributing financial support 
            to such bodies in a fairer and more equitable way.</p>

            believes that Fair Trade activity, encouraged as it is by Oxfam Scotland 
            and other non-governmental organisations and agencies, performs a 
            valuable role in assisting with the setting up of women's co-operatives, 
            small businesses and village enterprises throughout the developing 
            world which provide important economic and social assistance to the 
            families and communities of those involved in such productive activities, 
            and commends the shops and stores which sell Fair Trade products and

            off the north-west of Scotland which are more than 4,500 years old
