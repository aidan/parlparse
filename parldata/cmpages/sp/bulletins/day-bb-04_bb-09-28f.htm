          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1761</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>World Alzheimer&rsquo;s Day 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 21 September 2004 was World Alzheimer&rsquo;s Day; notes that some 62,000 people in Scotland have dementia and that the number grows as the population ages; notes that, according to Alzheimer&rsquo;s Scotland, the status quo is not an option and that changes need to be made to health and community care services to ensure that both sufferers and their families, who are often unpaid carers, are properly supported; notes that the direct costs of this disease are substantially greater than strokes, heart disease and cancer but that expenditure on research does not reflect this, and believes that the Scottish Executive should therefore increase research funding into the causes, and possible treatments, of dementia and should ensure that proper systems are in place to identify, fund and support carers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1760#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>The Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup Final</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers and sponsors of the Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup Final; further congratulates both the Inveraray and Fort William teams for providing such a spectacular final in Oban and Inveraray for winning the cup for the first time in 74 years; welcomes the BBC&lsquo;s live coverage of the game, and hopes that this will lead to more recognition of the key role that shinty plays in sport in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1759</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Meals on Wheels: A Vital Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the withdrawal of the meals on wheels service in the Scottish Borders, replacing it with a fortnightly delivery of frozen food; notes that carers, elderly people, consultants and other nursing staff at the Borders General Hospital Medical Services Directorate&rsquo;s Department of Medicine for the Elderly have stated that stopping the service will result in a deterioration in elderly care in the Borders; deplores the fact that this practice has been adopted elsewhere in Scotland; notes that, although microwaves and freezers are provided where necessary, there are many frail and elderly who cannot cope with these gadgets, which may result in food being undercooked, running the risk of food poisoning; further notes that vital, often daily, human contact with the volunteers delivering the meals, sometimes the only human contact elderly people have in the day and a contact that at times has been life-saving, will be lost, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to require local authorities who have adopted this procedure to reinstate the meals on wheels service to those frail and elderly people who request it, giving them the dignity of choice which all Scottish citizens deserve.</p>
