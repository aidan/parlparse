          <p> <strong>*S3M-779</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Tackling Homophobia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Stonewall Scotland on tackling homophobia in the workplace and public services, raising the issue of homophobic bullying and hate crime and helping 30 major Scottish employers and major public services such as the health service and police to tackle discrimination and ensuring that their services reach and deliver for Scotland&rsquo;s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-778</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>CSA Discriminates Against Scottish Workforce</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament opposes the decision of the Child Support Agency (CSA) to impose holiday arrangements on its Scottish workforce during the festive period that are based on the English holiday period; notes that it has not taken into account the different school holidays in Scotland; further notes the ongoing campaign by the PCS union to ensure that the 1,600 CSA staff in Scotland are not discriminated against in holiday entitlement over the festive season, and calls on the CSA to end this ongoing discrimination against its Scottish workforce and ensure that the different holiday period in Scotland is fully recognised and provided for in its festive holiday arrangements.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-777</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Muslim Prayer Rooms in SPL Clubs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Premier League football clubs for setting up special prayer rooms for Muslim players and fans; believes that, in including such vital services to cater for the needs of Scotland&rsquo;s Muslim population, Scotland&rsquo;s football clubs are taking the initiative for other recreational and leisure facilities to follow, and hopes that other services and facilities will continue to provide for the special needs of all faith and non-faith groups in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-776</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>RIAS Award for the Pier Arts Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the &pound;4.5 million project to extend and refurbish the Pier Arts Centre in Stromness has won the prestigious Royal Incorporation of Architecture in Scotland Andrew Doolan Award; congratulates the project architects, Riach and Hall, and all those involved in the design and construction of the project for their well-earned success in winning the award and for providing a high-quality building that sits so well in the unique harbourside townscape of Stromness; believes that the reopened Pier Arts Centre will provide both an ideal home for the impressive collection of 20th Century British art presented by the centre&rsquo;s founder, Margaret Gardiner, and a valuable space for visiting exhibitions, and strongly recommends that all those with an interest in art and architecture make a visit to the Pier Arts Centre, just one of the many highlights of a visit to Orkney, described last year by the Lonely Planet as the &quot;glittering centrepiece in Scotland&rsquo;s treasure chest of attractions&quot;.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-775</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Scots Language Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the BBC Trust&rsquo;s publication of the BBC&rsquo;s public purposes which the BBC is committed to implementing under the terms of its charter; notes the statements therein that the BBC should represent the United Kingdom, its nations, regions and communities and that, in its output, it should support the UK&rsquo;s indigenous minority languages &quot;such as Gaelic, Welsh, Irish and Ulster Scots&quot;; notes the fact that the Scots language of Scotland, the UK&rsquo;s indigenous minority language with the most speakers, is not mentioned; expresses its condemnation of this omission, and calls on the BBC to apologise and rectify the situation immediately.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-774</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Hannah Frank</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates veteran artist, Hannah Frank, on entering her centenary year; notes that this Glasgow artist studied at the Glasgow School of Art and University of Glasgow in the 1920s and has been called the &quot;last living link to the Scottish Art Nouveau movement&quot; and that she has exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy, Royal Glasgow Institute and the Royal Academy in her 75-year artistic career; celebrates the current national and international five-year tour of her drawings and sculpture, and welcomes the fact that Glasgow university has recognised Hannah Frank&rsquo;s contribution to art with an exhibition of her drawings and sculpture which will open at the university on her 100th birthday, 23 August 2008.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-773</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Why Shetland is Better than the Bahamas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the recent survey of the best island destinations in the world, carried out by <em>National Geographic</em>, rated Shetland as the third most desirable island grouping to visit, well ahead of Hawaii, Barbados, Bermuda, Capri and Mauritius; further notes that the judges stated that Shetland had &quot;everything with bells on&quot;, including spectacular sea cliffs, pristine beaches, fascinating geology, more than a million breeding seabirds, the highest density of otters in Europe, regular sightings of killer whales, superb displays of rare sub-Arctic flora and extremely high integrity in all aspects of heritage and ecology; believes that this news will come as no surprise to anyone who has visited Shetland; commends all those involved in the tourist industry in Shetland for adding a warm Shetland welcome to the natural and cultural assets that make Shetland a world-class visitor destination, and looks forward to the future growth of the Shetland tourist industry built on the firm foundation of its current success.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-772</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>North Kelvinside Sports Complex</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that recent surveys have identified a shortage of sports pitches in the north of Glasgow and welcomes therefore the decision by Glasgow City Council to build a sports complex in the grounds of the former North Kelvinside School; recognises the valiant efforts of North Kelvin Community Council and Councillor Jim Mackechnie to save the existing pitches and to have them enhanced in this way, and further recognises the sterling efforts of the Compendium Trust which has also worked hard to secure playing field provision in the area.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-762</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Drake Music Project Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Drake Music Project Scotland on being awarded &pound;4,645 in-kind sponsorship and a &pound;4,645 SENASA award from Scotsys Ltd as part of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s New Arts Sponsorship Awards; recognises the excellent work that Drake Music Project Scotland does with adults and young people with disabilities; notes the project&rsquo;s 10th anniversary in 2007 and, as part of a new office move, its launch of a programme of taster sessions for clients at its new base, SPACE, in Craigmillar, Edinburgh; recognises the hard work and commitment that Arts and Business Scotland has undertaken in making this scheme a running success, and believes that this money is even more valuable in light of the growing concern across Edinburgh that the SNP/Liberal Democrat council will make significant cuts to the grants budget for voluntary groups across the city.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-762.1</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Drake Music Project Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-762) in the name of George Foulkes, leave out from &quot;in light of&quot; to end and insert &quot;given the dire financial position inherited by the new administration from the previous Labour administration&rsquo;s mishandling of the council finances.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-747</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Independence is the Only Solution to West Lothian Question</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Conservative Party is actively considering campaigning for the creation of an English Grand Committee, while there are others who support the creation of a federal structure for the United Kingdom; further notes that these two schemes are often floated as answers to the West Lothian Question; recognises that, even if either scheme was instituted, it would leave Scotland powerless to affect change in certain areas such as the renewal of Trident, which was opposed by a majority of Scottish members of the Westminster Parliament as well as of members of the Scottish Parliament but would still go ahead even in the context of an English Grand Committee or a federal UK, and believes that there is only one sensible answer to the West Lothian Question and that is independence for Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-747.1</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Independence is the Only Solution to West Lothian Question</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-747) in the name of Jamie Hepburn, leave out from &quot;that the Conservative&quot; to end and insert &quot;the findings of the Social Attitudes Survey for 2007 which shows support for independence at only 23%, the lowest level since the survey began a decade ago; further notes that when in government the Conservative Party was content to use the votes of English MPs to push through Scotland-only legislation including for the community charge, or poll tax, and relied on the votes of Northern Irish MPs to sustain itself in government until its defeat in 1997; further notes that during previous spells of devolution in Northern Ireland until 1974 no proposal to preclude Northern Irish MPs voting at Westminster was forthcoming from the Conservative Party, and considers that the current mood in both the Conservative Party and Scottish National Party is motivated more by their inability to secure sufficient support for their policies rather than any concern for fairness.&quot;</p>
