<p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information to the Parliament.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>S3W-27333</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the figure of a &pound;496 million reduction in the planned departmental expenditure limit budget for 2010-11 quoted by ministers includes the pre-Budget report consequentials of &pound;5.2 million.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27334</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what is included in the &pound;496 million reduction in the planned departmental expenditure limit budget for 2010-11 apart from the &pound;391.7 million in efficiency savings, &pound;128.6 million reduction in NHS capital spend and the budget consequentials of &pound;24.7 million.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27335</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the (a) provisional and (b) actual budget outturns were for the departmental expenditure limit for (i) 2006-07, (ii) 2007-08 and (iii) 2008-09.</p>

<p><strong>S3W-27339</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much of the end-year flexibility drawn down for 2010-11 with HM Treasury&rsquo;s agreement has been allocated as part of the Scottish Budget Spending Review 2007 and how much remains to be allocated.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-27340</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the actual underspend for 2008-09 combined with the unallocated end-year flexibility from previous years is sufficient to fully cover the &pound;128.6 million reduction in NHS capital spend for 2010-11.</p>
