<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5335</strong> <strong>Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Getting it Right for Every Child</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Getting it right for every child (GIRFEC) approach; commends Highland and the other pathfinder programmes for their work in developing the approach; notes progress under the eCare framework to enable secure, targeted information sharing across Scotland; welcomes the report by the University of Edinburgh on progress to date, particularly with regard to the pathfinder programme in Highland; welcomes Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education&rsquo;s summary report on its first round of multi-agency children&rsquo;s services inspections as providing a clear and comprehensive picture of how children&rsquo;s services are operating across Scotland, and encourages work to further develop and implement the GIRFEC approach as a means of public services and the third sector working with parents and communities to improve outcomes for children and deliver the Early Years Framework, Achieving our Potential, and Equally Well.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-5334</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets that for the last two years the SNP government has presided over a series of failures on a range of education indicators, including teacher numbers and class sizes; believes that there are fundamental challenges that must be addressed in order to tackle the growing crisis in Scottish education, and therefore calls on the new Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to take immediate action to rebuild the bond of trust between central and local government and establish a constructive working relationship with local authorities so that schools can deliver the best possible outcomes for Scottish education and young people, to bring fresh impetus to the implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence and the new national qualifications, providing teachers with the clarity, training and resources that they urgently require to implement the changes, and to focus on the key issue of teacher numbers, giving new teachers the career opportunities that they deserve and delivering effective workforce planning for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5333</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Neil Kinnock</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of Glasgow Caledonian University to award an honorary degree to Neil Kinnock, former European Commissioner and leader of the Labour Party, in recognition of Mr Kinnock&rsquo;s outstanding contribution as a politician, statesman and champion of increased educational opportunities for those previously denied them.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5331&diams; </strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>National Eligibility Criteria for Adult Social Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the contents of the draft guidelines, <em>National Eligibility for Adult Social Care and Waiting Times for Personal and Nursing Care</em>, which it considers will have an adverse impact on preventative services for disabled adults; notes the problems that have been experienced by disabled adults in accessing support services in Edinburgh; is concerned that the guidelines are based on the current working practices of many local authorities across Scotland, which were themselves based on the UK Government&rsquo;s<em> Fair Access to Care Services</em>; notes that <em>Fair Access to Care Services</em> was originally devised to decide the eligibility for support of older people with progressive age-related incapacity and loss of independence and not for disabled adults for whom it considers access to care is about the right to independence, and believes that the needs of adults requiring social care would be better served if there was guidance on free personal and nursing care and new guidance dealing with the community care services provided under different legislation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5330</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Mohammad Othman and Israel&rsquo;s Use of Administrative Detention as a Substitute for Prosecution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, further to motion S3M-05062, notes reports that Israel not only continues to hold Mohammad Othman in administrative detention but has also threatened and pressured him into confessions and that no external evidence was brought to the military court that renewed his detention; understands that international human rights organisations and the United Nations have repeatedly condemned Israel&rsquo;s recourse to military justice systems that do not meet international standards of due process, and condemns Israel for this and other breaches of human rights, believing that such actions do nothing to make the people of Israel safer in the long term but rather serve to perpetuate that country&rsquo;s troubles.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5329</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Working towards a Shared Future</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the report,<em> &quot;Sectarianism&quot; and the Workplace</em>, by the STUC, which found evidence that sectarianism persists in the Scottish workplace; believes that the report highlights the enduring prevalence of sectarian attitudes in Scotland; acknowledges the importance of challenging attitudes early on by engaging with young people to ensure that they enter the workplace with a better understanding of the issue of sectarianism in Scotland; welcomes projects such as the Community Youth Rugby Initiative in the Coatbridge area, supported by Sense Over Sectarianism, which seeks to challenge sectarianism through rugby by engaging children from seven local secondary schools in composite school teams; notes that the initiative also includes a structured programme that seeks to impact on religious intolerance and racism and recognise and respect diversity within the community; further notes that the initiative currently has 300 participants, with numbers expected to double within a year; commends work by the summer holiday project for primary seven pupils from Coatbridge and Airdrie delivered by Albion Rovers Football Club, Strathclyde Police, beCogent and Sense Over Sectarianism that sought to challenge attitudes among primary school-age children; recognises the potential impact that projects targeted at primary and secondary pupils could have in shaping societal attitudes in the future, thus eroding the persistence of sectarianism in the workplace in the long term; realises that Scotland still faces a number of complex challenges in highlighting sectarianism in communities and workplaces, and considers that these challenges are best met via a vigorous, zero-tolerance approach from the Scottish Government and other relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5328&diams; </strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>40 Years of the Open University</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Open University on its 40th year; recognises the key role that Harold Wilson and Jennie Lee played in developing the Open University; supports the positive work that the university does in Scotland as an accessible and innovative way for people to fulfil their ambitions for lifelong learning and social mobility, providing learning opportunities to the widest possible range of people and contributing to Scotland&rsquo;s economic development; notes that it is now the United Kingdom&rsquo;s largest university, teaching almost 200,000 students a year and, since opening in 1969, it has helped over two million people realise their potential; notes the central role that part-time higher education, such as that delivered by the Open University, has to play in supporting upskilling and reskilling in Scotland&rsquo;s workforce, and considers that appropriately resourced part-time flexible learning has the potential to make an even more significant contribution to supporting Scotland&rsquo;s skills agenda and to promoting educational opportunity and social justice.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5327</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Shipweld 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Rosyth-based Babcock apprentices, Ryan Rice and Liam McBride, on winning the 2009 Shipweld best yard competition held at Barrow on 12 November 2009; notes that the competition featured yards from across United Kingdom, including Portsmouth, the Clyde and Barrow; further notes that entrants faced a series of craft challenges designed to test key welding requirements for the manufacture of surface and subsurface vessels; recognises the skills and techniques demonstrated by all the apprentice welders in the competition; welcomes the Shipweld competition&rsquo;s contribution to promoting skills development and safe working practices, and looks forward to further success for Scottish apprentices in future competitions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5326</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Designation of Lead Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Health and Sport Committee be designated as the lead committee in consideration of the Alcohol etc. (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5325</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 (Designation of Participating Countries) (Scotland) (No. 3) Order 2009 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5324</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2009 Amendment Order 2009 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5321</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that &quot;09:00&quot; be substituted for &quot;09:15&quot; in Rule 2.2.3 for the purpose of allowing the meeting of the Parliament on Thursday 3 December 2009 to begin at 9.00 am.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5320</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Falkirk Council Cuts Arts Again</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision by the Labour/Tory-led administration of Falkirk Council to scrap the Big in Falkirk festival; believes that this decision is short-sighted; acknowledges the work of the people of Falkirk in making Big in Falkirk Scotland&rsquo;s national street festival over the last 10 years, and also notes that this decision, together with the closure of the Park Gallery, does not help Falkirk&rsquo;s reputation as a friend of the arts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5319</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Bill Shankly, Glenbuck&rsquo;s Most Famous Son</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes to pay tribute to the late Bill Shankly on the 50th anniversary of his appointment as manager of Liverpool FC, where he took the team from the old second division to win three league championships, two FA Cups and the UEFA Cup; notes that he began his career with the famous Glenbuck Cherrypickers, whose record in producing 50 professional footballers from a mining village with a population of only 1,000 people is unequalled in world football, and commends Bill Shankly&rsquo;s assertion that &quot;The socialism I believe in is everyone working for each other, everyone having a share of the rewards. It&rsquo;s the way I see football, the way I see life.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5318</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Forres Pies are World&rsquo;s Best</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Murdoch Brothers Butchers on its success in the 2010 World Scotch Pie Championships; commends the Forres-based butcher shop in beating out 85 other entrants to earn the title of World Scotch Pie Champions while also taking home the bronze medal for its pork pie and gold medal for its steak pie, and recognises the continued excellence of Murdoch Brothers, a family company dating back three generations, and the world-class quality of its 40-year-old original family recipe, still in use today.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5317</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Western Isles Winners from Scottish Traditional Music Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those who won prizes and who were nominated for prizes in the 2009 Scottish Traditional Music Awards on Saturday 28 November 2009; notes in particular the success of those winners with Western Isles connections, including The Hebridean Celtic Festival, which won the title of Event of the Year, Christine Primrose, originally from Carloway, Lewis, who was voted Gaelic Singer of the Year, Bodega, whose lead singer, Norrie MacIver, is also from Carloway, Lewis, who won Scottish Folk Band of the Year, legendary, and now reformed, Gaelic folk group Na h-Oganaich, who have been inducted into the Hands up for Trad Hall of Fame, and lastly South Uist performer Rona Lightfoot, who was also inducted into the Hall of Fame, and recognises the breadth of talent that currently exists in Scottish traditional music.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5315</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Trading away Human Rights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that any free trade agreement entered into by the European Union and Colombia would be a step in the wrong direction for those who have suffered or are suffering human rights abuses in Colombia; calls on the European Union to follow the lead of the United States of America by refusing a free trade agreement with Colombia until the human rights record is up to an acceptable standard, and further calls on the European Union to put pressure on Colombia to clean up its act on human rights and refuse any agreement that is not endorsed by Colombian civil society.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5314</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Portree High Wins BT Scotland Debate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Portree High School on its victory in the finals of the 2009 BT Scotland National Gaelic Schools Debate competition held in the Scottish Parliament on 25 November 2009; notes that Portree, represented by Anna MacMullan and Eilidh Robertson, prevailed over Bishopbriggs Academy in a competition that featured impressive efforts and talent by all of the competitors, and, finally, commends all participants in the final and preceding heats for their excellent knowledge of the subject and effective delivery of their case in each debate.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5312</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Relay for life in Fife 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes once again the fantastic success of Cancer Research UK in its 24-hour Relay for Life in Dalgety Bay in July 2009; welcomes the third annual fundraising event and congratulates all who took part and helped raise a final amount of over &pound;67,000; further congratulates the efforts of committee members, team captains and all who supported the event from businesses and the local community; is delighted that organisers were able to visit the Parliament to celebrate their achievement, and looks forward to future Relay for Life events to support the progress being made in cancer treatment, diagnosis and prevention across Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5311</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Energy Suppliers Accused of Breaking Rules Designed to Protect Customers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern recent media reports that suggest that five energy suppliers have been accused of breaking rules that are designed to protect the poorest customers; notes that the National Housing Federation claims that Scottish Power, British Gas, Scottish and Southern Energy, npower and E.ON breached new licence conditions, which set a cap on how much more pre-paying customers can be charged than those paying by direct debit; believes that this will affect some of the poorest people in society and hit them hardest in their pockets, and therefore urges Ofgem to investigate this as a matter of urgency and rectify this situation as soon as possible.</p>
