            views with regret the announcement of the closure of the Optical Coating 

            Laboratory Inc in Dalgety Bay, Fife with the loss of 160 jobs; recognises

            the new definitive Scottish stamps, launched in June 1999, should 

            be available at Post Offices, they are not always available and are 

            not available at other retail outlets and therefore calls upon the 

            Royal Mail to ensure that these stamps are as widely accessible as 

            possible, in particular that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> 

            class stamps are available at all times in Post Offices throughout 

            Scotland and at the other usual retail outlets, including the Scottish

            Park and Loch Eck within the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National 

            Park; further notes that this is in direct contradiction to the views 

            of the SNH Reporter charged with advising the Scottish Executive; 

            recognises the many public bodies which are in favour of extending 

            the National Park’s boundaries including Argyll and Bute Council, 

            visitscotland and Forest Enterprise; believes that particular notice 

            must be taken of the strong public support in the area for such inclusion, 

            and calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement the recommendation 

            of the SNH Reporter to include Argyll Forest Park and Loch Eck within

            of the tourism crisis and its particularly critical effect on rural 

            areas; is mindful that for years before this crisis developed many 

            people had asked for the Stone to be moved to its true home and believes 

            that the moment is now ripe for a special gesture to be made to assist 

            at least one rural area; accepts that Edinburgh Castle, the Stone’s 

            present home, contains a magnificent amount of other treasures and 

            that the Stone would be a tourist attraction in its own right if displayed 

            at Perth Museum and Art Gallery, who have indicated a willingness 

            to accept it, and supports the Scottish People’s Mission who have 

            lodged a Petition (PE 326) with the Parliament on the removal of the 

            Stone from the Castle to Perthshire.</a></font></p>
