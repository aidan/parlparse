            Brian Monteith: Scotch Whisky Opt-out from EU Directive</strong>—That the 
            Parliament notes with concern the possible impact of the EU’s Water 
            Framework Directive on the removal of water from rivers and water 
            courses and its potentially damaging effect on the Scotch whisky industry; 
            recognises that the industry is important to Scotland’s economy and 
            the many rural areas where distilleries are located; welcomes the 
            efforts made by representatives of all parties to convince the EU 
            to consider opt-outs for Scottish distilleries, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should apply immediately for an exemption from 
            the Directive in order to protect the jobs and livelihoods of those 
            working in the industry.</font></p>

            East Ayrshire Council for working towards achieving a community safety 
            strategy that encompasses safety at home, on the roads, and throughout 
            the community; is aware that more than a third of all accidents take 
            place in the home, resulting in an estimated two and a half million 
            casualty attendances each year; acknowledges the importance of creating 
            a central database of information relevant to home safety, and asks 
            the Scottish Executive to consider supporting the introduction of 
            a Home Safety Act.</font></p>

            John Home Robertson: A Balanced Energy Policy</strong>—That the Parliament 
            <a name="MotionText">welcomes Her Majesty's Government’s action to 
            reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases; acknowledges that nuclear 
            power has a role to play in a balanced energy policy; notes the excellent 
            safety record of the nuclear power stations at Torness, Hunterston 
            and Chapelcross; recognises that the Edinburgh-based British Energy 
            injects £140 million into the Scottish economy per annum, generates 
            55% of Scotland’s electricity, provides 1,400 highly skilled jobs 
            and supports another 3,500 jobs in Scotland; acknowledges the expertise 
            of a workforce with long experience in the Scottish nuclear industry; 
            notes that the STUC has, for the last 20 years, supported an energy 
            policy with a nuclear component, and, subject to the construction 
            of a permanent storage facility for nuclear waste, considers that 
            there will be a case for the replacement of nuclear generating plant 
            as an environmentally friendly source of electricity for the future.</a></font></p>
