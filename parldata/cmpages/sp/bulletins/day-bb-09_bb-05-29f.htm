<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4272</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Remember, I&rsquo;m Still Me</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the report, <em>Remember, I&rsquo;m Still Me,</em> by the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland and the Care Commission; notes that the report draws on investigations into 30 care homes across Scotland that have residents with dementia; acknowledges that the report has found a number of areas where care homes are failing people with dementia, including more than half of residents not having the opportunity to leave the care home premises; further notes that, out of a total of 182 personal plans, fewer than a quarter had adequate details and a further third contained no life history at all; is concerned by the findings of the report, which suggest the misuse of medication, with a number of residents on more than one antipsychotic medication; believes that it is vital for care homes to have as much information as possible recorded in order that they can provide a high standard of care for residents with dementia; agrees that immediate action should be taken in those cases where bad practice continues to have a detrimental effect on residents; considers that the report is further evidence of the failings in the Scottish care system, and therefore believes that a culture change in Scottish care homes is essential and that the charter of rights currently being developed by the Cross-party Group on Alzheimer&rsquo;s is one important strand towards improving the quality of care and treatment for people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4271</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Moratorium on Opencast Coal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the serious impact of opencast coal mines on communities throughout Scotland; understands the harmful effects on health and the serious disruption faced by local communities forced to live with opencast mines on their doorsteps; acknowledges that plans to expand opencast mining will blight yet more communities and are incompatible with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s stated climate change targets; condemns the Scottish Government for leaving the vast majority of planning decisions concerning opencast coal mining in the hands of councils with huge vested interests in supporting the industry; accepts that Scotland should be investing more in proven renewable technologies before unproven end-of-pipe solutions, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring in a moratorium on new opencast projects and to set out a timescale for the phasing out of Scotland&rsquo;s two coal-fired power stations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4270</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Hewlett Packard to Reconsider Erskine Relocations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave concern over the decision by Hewlett Packard to relocate 843 employees from its Erskine site to the Czech Republic during 2010; notes that Hewlett Packard has already cut 150 jobs in February 2009, meaning that current relocations raise possible job losses on the site to nearly 1,000, and calls on Hewlett Packard to reconsider this short<font color="#0000ff">-</font>term decision made in the midst of economic recession and retain its core facility and employees at Erskine.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4269&diams; </strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Wildlife Week, 6 to 14 June 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) for organising Wildlife Week, 6 to 14 June 2009; notes that there are over 230 events and activities taking place throughout Scotland, including the celebration of peatlands, woodlands and marine environments in Dumfries and Galloway, and appreciates the efforts by SWT, its sister charities and non-governmental organisations in Scotland in raising public awareness of the richness of Scotland&rsquo;s natural environment and the need to preserve and enhance habitats to conserve Scotland&rsquo;s wildlife and ensure that future generations can also enjoy its diversity.</p>
