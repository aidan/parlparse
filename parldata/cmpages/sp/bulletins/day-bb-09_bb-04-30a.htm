<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Liberal Democrats Debate: Education&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4007</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, on the second anniversary of the election of the Scottish Government, the index of its broken promises contains more references to education than any other area of public policy; believes that the failures of the SNP on teachers and teaching are potentially the most damaging to the long-term interests of Scotland; notes the drop of 1,000 in the number of teachers in Scotland&rsquo;s schools despite the SNP promise to maintain numbers; regrets the microscopic progress on class size reductions; recalls the failure to offer ongoing job opportunities for newly qualified teachers and laments the pressure on teacher training places when demand for such places from talented graduates remains high, and calls for the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to publish, by the end of the school year and in time for September, a detailed workforce plan for teaching that can restore teacher numbers, increase training places, get newly qualified teachers into work in schools and provide assurance that the Scottish Government is prepared to learn from the mistakes of the first half of its term of office as it embarks on its second. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4007.1</strong> <strong>Keith Brown: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4007) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from &quot;the index&quot; to end and insert &quot;spending on education has risen by more than 40% since the advent of devolution; further notes that, despite a decade of investment, standards of attainment and achievement have only been maintained while key international competitors have improved; welcomes the recent report by HM Inspectorate of Education, <em>Improving Scottish Education 2005-2008</em>, highlighting the need for further and faster improvement in our education system; believes that the focus on inputs under previous administrations masked the lack of significant improvement on standards of attainment and achievement; further believes that the reform of the curriculum is a critical step in improving standards of attainment, and calls on the Scottish Government to maintain progress towards implementation of&nbsp;the Curriculum for Excellence.&quot;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-4007.1.1</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-4007.1) in the name of Keith Brown, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward detailed proposals by the start of the 2009-10 academic year as to how it will implement amendment S3M-3164.1, which recognised the need for the Scottish Government to ensure that pupils in Scotland are properly tested in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy by the end of primary 7 and which was given unanimous support by the Parliament on 7 January 2009.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> <strong>S3M-4007.2</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4007) in the name of Margaret Smith, after &quot;remains high&quot; insert &quot;; deeply regrets that the SNP government&rsquo;s response to the reduction in full-time teaching posts has been to cut teacher training places by 18% despite its pledges to maintain teacher numbers and reduce class sizes&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Liberal Democrats Debate: The Economy&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4006</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>The Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the UK Budget and the plans to increase fuel duty; recognises the high premium over the national average paid for fuel at filling stations in remote rural and particularly island areas and the financial and social impact that this has on individuals and businesses; believes that increased fuel duty will have a damaging effect on the economy and competitiveness in these areas, not least due to the limited public transport alternatives; notes that current EU law allows fuel duty to be cut by up to 2.4p per litre and that this power is already used in France, Portugal and Greece, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the UK Government and the European Commission before the final passage of the Finance Bill to construct a derogation under the EU energy products directive, or otherwise, to permit variable rates of duty for specified remote rural areas to bring down the price of fuel at the pump to that available in other parts of the United Kingdom. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-4006.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: The Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4006) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from &quot;notes that current&quot; to end and insert &quot;and calls on the Scottish Government to report back to the Parliament on the extent to which a fuel duty derogation for rural areas would be permissible under EU law and what impact such a derogation would have on carbon emissions and the Scottish budget.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>11.40 am</strong> General Question Time&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="QuestionText" id="QuestionText"></a><strong>1.

<p><strong>2.55 pm</strong> Scottish Government Debate: Budget Implications for Scotland&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4004</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Budget Implications for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the contents of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s Budget last week; recognises that this is a product of poor financial management of the UK economy in recent years that will leave unprecedented burdens of debt for many years to come; acknowledges the significant pressure that the reduction of planned budgets of &pound;500 million will have on public services, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward budget proposals for 2010-11 that will support a sustainable economy and effective public services and include an assessment of the carbon impact of its budget. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4004.3</strong> <strong>Andy Kerr: Budget Implications for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4004) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the real-terms increase in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget for 2010-11; also welcomes the earlier measures that the UK Government has taken to support Scotland during the global downturn, such as the &pound;50 billion funding to Scottish banks to support bank workers, families and businesses who rely on the banks and the &pound;2 billion that has gone into the pockets of hard working Scots and the VAT cut that has given the equivalent of &pound;275 to every Scottish family and boosted retail sales; recognises that last week&rsquo;s Budget continues to provide real help now to families and businesses, such as the guarantee that anyone aged between 18 and 25 who has been unemployed for 12 months or more will be given a training place or a job and the new investment in the renewable energy industry, which will benefit Scotland, and calls on the Parliament to recognise the role the UK Government has taken in leading the international response to the global economic crisis.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4004.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee: Budget Implications for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4004) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;; notes the research by the Centre for Public Policy for Regions (CPPR) that predicts that in real terms the Scottish Government Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) will be between &pound;2.1 billion and &pound;3.8 billion lower in 2013-14 than in 2009-10; further notes the comments of John McLaren of CPPR that &quot;the prospects beyond 2013-14 are also not good and although positive real terms growth rates are likely to return, they are unlikely to be very large until UK net debt as a share of GDP falls, possibly not until the 2030s&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to prepare contingency plans on how such changes to the Scottish DEL will be managed.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-4004.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Budget Implications for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4004) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;; agrees that the temporary cut in VAT has proved costly and ineffective, and regrets the decision of the Scottish MPs who voted to support the cut when the money could have been used to create thousands of jobs in green energy and public transport.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em> Parliamentary Bureau Motions&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4022</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Committee Membership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Rhoda Grant be appointed to replace Jackie Baillie on the Health and Sport Committee.</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-4023</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Jackie Baillie be appointed to replace Johann Lamont as the Scottish Labour Party substitute on the Equal Opportunities Committee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.00 pm </strong>Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-3933</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Private Residential Care Home Accountability</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vital support for vulnerable elderly people provided through well managed care homes in Scotland; notes the increase in the number of privately managed and financed residential care homes in the Scottish Borders and further notes the role of the Care Commission in ensuring that all care homes in the public and private sector are delivering a high standard of care; also notes that financial mismanagement of private sector homes operations has caused worrying disruption in care but considers that there are very limited statutory powers for the Care Commission and local authorities to scrutinise the financial capability and security of private care homes operations, and believes that it would be beneficial for there to be more regular financial accountability as there is for the standard of care.</p>
