    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-958</b> <strong>Mr Michael McMahon: Palliative Care</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament welcomes the establishment of the Cross Party Group on Palliative Care;
    welcomes the current priority status in the NHS in Scotland for cancer services;
    recognises that, despite improvements in the treatment of some cancers, the overall
    figures for cancer survival remain poor by international standards; believes that this
    demonstrates the need for more attention and resources to be focussed on palliative care;
    further notes that palliative care aims to control pain and other distressing symptoms in
    order to achieve the best possible quality of life for patients and their families; notes
    that people with chronic and progressive conditions other than cancer also have palliative
    care needs, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to confirm that palliative care is
    adequately included in the developing strategies for cancer care and for care of those
    with chronic and progressive illness in Scotland.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-957</b> <strong>Sarah Boyack: National Parks (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament agrees that the National Parks (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Nicol Stephen<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-956</b> <strong>Henry McLeish: Education and Training (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament agrees that the Education and Training (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Nicol Stephen<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-955</b> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: The Electricity Lands and Water
    Undertakings (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2000</strong>&#151;That the Local
    Government Committee in consideration of The Electricity Lands and Water Undertakings
    (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2000 recommends that the Order be approved.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-954</b> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: The Docks and Harbours (Rateable
    Values) (Scotland) Order 2000</strong>&#151;That the Local Government Committee in
    consideration of The Docks and Harbours (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 2000 recommends
    that the Order be approved.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-953</b> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Cessation of Silicone Implant
    Operations, Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the concern of the European
    Commission over silicone implant operations; urges the Scottish Executive to demand an
    immediate cessation of all silicone implant operations in the NHS and in private hospitals
    in Scotland in accordance with the wishes of campaigners in Scotland and pending the
    outcome of EC investigations, bearing in mind that around 200,000 legal cases are pending
    world-wide against silicone manufacturers; further notes that Canada, America and other
    countries have banned these operations, that Her Majesty's Government&#146;s refusal to
    ban was controversial after challenges to the impartiality of a Department of Health
    investigation in 1998, an investigation into female breast implants which was conducted by
    six male doctors and nine male observers, with women doctors, patients&#146; groups and
    nurses excluded from serving on the so called &quot;independent review&quot; and that the
    same branch of the Health Department which had previously cleared silicone was reporting
    for a fourth time on the issue, clearing silicone despite pleas from American doctors not
    to take risks America refused to take, and finally notes that American doctors were so
    concerned at Her Majesty's Government&#146;s attitude that they flew to London in 1998 to
    give evidence against silicone, pleaded with Her Majesty's Government not to risk
    endangering women&#146;s health and cited cases of sick and dying implant patients in the
    US and of well known women having implants removed.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-952#</b> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: Dementia Awareness Week</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament believes that the care of people with dementia represents one of the
    greatest challenges to health and welfare services throughout Scotland because of the
    prolonged and complex nature of the illness and the severity of its consequences for the
    large numbers affected and their families, and welcomes the initiative of Alzheimer
    Scotland&#151;Action on Dementia during Dementia Awareness Week to highlight the need for
    better planning mechanisms to provide integrated and comprehensive health and social care
    services for this group of people.</p>
