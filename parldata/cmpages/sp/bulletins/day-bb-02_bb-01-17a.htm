                        <strong>Promoting Aberdeen as Europe's Energy Capital</strong>&#151;That 
                        the Parliament recognises the City of Aberdeen&#146;s 
                        role as Europe&#146;s oil and gas capital and the long-term 
                        contribution that the offshore sector will continue to 
                        make to the Scottish economy; believes that every effort 
                        should be made to ensure that the city evolves into Europe&#146;s 
                        &quot;Energy Capital&quot; thereby benefiting from the 
                        industry&#146;s enormous economic and environmental potential 
                        that can place Scotland in the vanguard of renewable energy 
                        business internationally; considers that the Scottish 
                        Executive should produce specific strategies aimed at 
                        supporting Scotland&#146;s oil and gas sector and renewable 
                        energy sector that also promote Aberdeen as Europe&#146;s 
                        energy capital, and further considers that the Executive 
                        should promote measures to ensure that, as far as possible, 
                        the new energy revolution is driven by indigenous interests.
