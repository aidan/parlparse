          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2083</strong></font><font face="Arial"> <strong>Tommy 
            Sheridan: BNP in Scotland</strong>—That the Parliament deplores the presence 
            of the fascist and racist BNP in Scotland and in particular their 
            visits to areas of Glasgow such as Sighthill and Pollokshields; believes 
            that their only purpose is to stir up racial hatred between asylum 
            seekers, members of ethnic minorities and local communities, when 
            members of all these communities have been striving to build bridges, 
            and calls upon the media not to provide a platform for the racist 
            and fascist views of organisations like the BNP which are designed 
            to spread hatred, division and fear, particularly among ethnic communities.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2082</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: G8 Summit</strong>—That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the decision by Italian and British 
            authorities to refuse access to Italy to a number of Scottish peace 
            and anti-globalisation campaigners; considers this to be a very sinister 
            and unacceptable development; condemns the decision of these authorities 
            to refuse Scottish citizens their legal right to participate in legitimate 
            protest, and calls upon the Minister for Justice to conduct a full 
            enquiry into these incidents in order to provide answers and explanations.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2081#</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson: Regulation 
            of Opencast Mining in the Lothians</strong>—That the Parliament endorses 
            the terms of the Lothian Structure Plan in relation to opencast mining, 
            as agreed by East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian Councils following 
            local consultation and a public inquiry; notes the overwhelming public 
            opposition to opencasting in inappropriate areas which would have 
            detrimental environmental and social effects and where opencast proposals 
            would blight valuable prospects for long-term economic development, 
            and rejects the decision of the Scottish Executive to impose amendments 
            to the structure plan which would designate substantial parts of the 
            three counties as areas of search for opencast coal.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2080</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Meeting of 
            the Parliament in Dumfries</strong>—That the Parliament notes the proposal 
            by the Crichton Development Company to accommodate the Parliament 
            in Dumfries in May 2002 to allow the Assembly Hall to be returned 
            to the Church of Scotland for its General Assembly; agrees that such 
            a temporary relocation would offer a significant boost to both the 
            local economy and the morale of the region following the foot-and-mouth 
            disease outbreak, and urges the Parliamentary Bureau to recognise 
            rural south Scotland by siting the Parliament in Dumfries in May 2002.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2079</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Glasgow West 
            Neighbourhood Watch</strong>—That the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow 
            West Neighbourhood Watch on winning the National Neighbourhood Watch 
            Group of the Year award.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2078</strong> <strong>Mike Watson: Protection of 
            Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill</strong>—That the Parliament agrees to the 
            general principles of the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2077#</strong> <strong>Fiona McLeod: Accident at 
            Chaplecross Nuclear Power Station</strong>—That the Parliament notes with 
            alarm the accident which occurred at the Chaplecross nuclear power 
            station on 5 July 2001; is frustrated that, as nuclear energy is largely 
            a reserved matter, it does not have access to a ministerial statement 
            on all actions being undertaken by all the relevant statutory agencies; 
            therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should demand that 
            responsibility for all areas of nuclear energy is devolved to the 
            Parliament, and affirms that an independent Scotland would be a nuclear 
            free nation.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2076</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Scottish 
            Huntington's Association in Fife</strong>—That the Parliament commends 
            the Fife branch of the Scottish Huntington’s Association (SHA) for 
            the work it does in supporting sufferers of Huntington’s Disease in 
            the Kingdom of Fife, including provision of group opportunities to 
            meet with others whose lives are affected by the disease, and also 
            commends the SHA for its advisory service which provides both emotional 
            and practical support for sufferers and carers alike.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2075</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Elimination 
            of Crimes Against Women Committed in the Name of Honour</strong>—That the 
            Parliament declares that crimes against women committed in the name 
            of honour are a human rights violation; fully supports the United 
            Nations General Assembly Resolution 55/66; expresses its concern at 
            the continuing occurrence of such violence in all regions of the world; 
            further expresses concern that some perpetrators assume they have 
            justification for committing these crimes against women in the name 
            of honour; supports a call for adequate punishment of the perpetrators 
            of such crimes; welcomes activities which are aimed at the elimination 
            of crimes against women committed in the name of honour, and calls 
            upon the appropriate human rights group to gather and disseminate 
            statistical information on the occurrence of crimes against women 
            in the name of honour which are committed in the UK.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2074#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Athelstaneford: 
            Birthplace of Scotland's Flag</strong>—That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Scottish Flag Trust on promoting the historic site at Athelstaneford 
            where Scotland’s flag, the St Andrew’s Cross, originated during a 
            9th century battle; further congratulates those local authorities 
            which have ignored a CoSLA protocol adopted from Westminster that 
            the Saltire should only be flown on St Andrew’s day and are flying 
            Scotland’s flag permanently, and calls for Scotland’s flag to be flown 
            at all times from all public buildings.</font></p>

            Athelstaneford: Birthplace of Scotland's Flag</strong>—As an amendment 
            to motion (S1M-2074) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave out from 
            &quot;further congratulates&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the 
            prominent position of the Saltire in the flag of the United Kingdom; 
            welcomes the fact that flags in the nations of the UK are seen as 
            expressions of the identity of partner nations and not as symbols 
            of exclusion or aggression, and congratulates the Scottish Flag Trust 
            and East Lothian Council on the development of an excellent visitor 
            centre to mark the birthplace of the Saltire at Athelstaneford&quot;.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-2073#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Scottish 
            Transport Group Pension Funds Surplus</strong>—That the Parliament notes 
            the recent revelation by the Scottish Executive that the total gross 
            surplus in the Scottish Transport Group Pension Funds is likely to 
            be of the order of £250 million, of which about £150 million may be 
            claimed by the UK Exchequer; recalls that last year about 100 members 
            of the Scottish Parliament signed Dennis Canavan’s motion S1M-1096, 
            calling for urgent action to be taken in order to secure the maximum 
            possible benefit for the pensioners from the Pension Funds surplus, 
            and therefore calls for the entire surplus to be paid to the pensioners 
            as soon as possible.</font></p>
