<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1705&diams; </strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Fuel Costs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the price of diesel is now over &pound;1.30 in the Western Isles and across Scotland&rsquo;s island and remote communities, making it probably the most expensive diesel in the western world; further notes that fuel costs now represent an ever increasing burden in the Western and Northern Isles, not least for businesses and fishermen, some of whom report 80% increases in diesel costs in the last two years; notes that the main company delivering fuel to the islands deposits fuel at differing costs at different ports on the West Coast despite the fact that the same vessel is used; notes the irony of an oil-producing nation putting its motorists, businesses, fishermen and rural businesses in this impossible position, and finally notes the various measures that exist in parts of France, which makes cuts in fuel duty in the remotest areas.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1704</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Falkirk Rugby Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk Rugby Club on winning the national first division championship; notes that the club have made rugby history by winning five consecutive championships in a row; wishes them well in the premiership next season, and pays tribute to the players, staff and support who have contributed to this magnificent achievement.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1703&diams; </strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>The Unforeseeable Outcome of SNH Management Agreements</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that some 150 farmers in Orkney and across Scotland, who entered into management agreements with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) under which they reduced the livestock numbers on their land during the single farm payment scheme reference period, suffer a loss of income after their SNH management agreement and the associated compensation ends as their single farm payment is based on their reduced livestock numbers rather than on the numbers they would have had if they had not entered into an SNH management agreement; further notes that, in September 2007, SNH made a proposal to ministers for payments to the farmers who suffered the loss on income, a proposal which required ministerial agreement before any payment could be made; believes that the SNH proposal offered a practical way of reducing the losses which the farmers suffered and which they could not have foreseen when they entered into the SNH management agreements; expresses its grave concern that ministers have withheld their agreement to the SNH proposal so that the farmers receive no compensation for their losses, and is concerned that this is not only an attack on natural justice but that it will also make farmers wary of entering into further agreements with SNH if they risk suffering unforeseeable losses in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1702</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Cluster Bombs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament joins humanitarian organisations across the world in calling for a full ban on cluster bombs; recognises that cluster bombs cause indiscriminate injury to civilians, often in the months and years after conflicts have ended; notes that at least 10,000 civilian casualties have resulted from the use of cluster bombs, with 60% of those killed and injured being children, and calls for the UK Government to sign up to a full ban on cluster bombs at next month&rsquo;s international summit in Dublin.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1701</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Celebrating 100 Years of the Territorial Army</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with pride the 100th year anniversary of the Territorial Army and pays tribute to all Territorials past and present for their service to their country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1700</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Queen of the South</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Queen of the South and Aberdeen football clubs for a thrilling game of football in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup on 12 April 2008 and further congratulates Queen of the South on reaching the final for the first time in the club&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1699</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>When All Else Fails Use Radio</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming World Amateur Radio Day on 18 April 2008; recognises the hobby as an important communication tool in bringing together people of all nationalities worldwide; acknowledges that amateur radio operatives, also known as &quot;Hams&quot;, have been the leaders in developing many of today&rsquo;s modern electronic and communications marvels; further acknowledges the emergency role amateur radio has played during disasters such as the Lockerbie bombing, Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 tsunami; recognises the comradeship that such a shared hobby develops among people of all ages in local clubs, and warmly congratulates, in particular, the Cockenzie and Port Seton Amateur Radio Club&rsquo;s charity work with the British Heart Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1692*#*</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>How Much is that Doggy in the Window?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the international trade in dog and cat fur leads to the slaughter of around 2 million dogs and cats in Asia each year; further notes that there is considerable public concern about the lack of protection for animals in China, given its role as the main exporter in the dog and cat fur trade; notes that it takes 12 to 15 adult dogs, usually Alsatians, for a dog fur coat, which may be labelled for instance &quot;fox&quot;or &quot;sobaki&quot; and up to 24 cats for a cat fur coat, to be made and that these may also be used as trim on hats and gloves; notes that EU Regulation 1523/2007 banning the sale, production, marketing and import into or export out of the EU of dog and cat fur and products containing these types of fur will not come into effect until the end of 2008 and that, in any event, it is difficult to identify, after processing, the skins without DNA testing, and considers that stringent DNA testing of unclassified furs presented for import should begin without delay and, when the species of the animal is not clearly identified, entry of the item in question should be prohibited, in the south of Scotland and elsewhere.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1681</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>HITRANS Supports Equal Treatment for All Island Ferries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Chairman of HITRANS, Duncan Macintyre, when interviewed by BBC Radio Orkney, stated that HITRANS was keen to see all islands benefiting from the reduced ferry fares which are currently to be granted exclusively to the Western Isles, Coll and Tiree under the two-and-a-half-year pilot of the Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) charging regime; further notes that Mr Macintyre stated that HITRANS&rsquo;s preference was for a straight 40% reduction in ferry fares for all islanders to follow the example of the successful Air Discount Scheme, introduced by the previous administration, which cuts the cost of island residents&rsquo; air travel on all lifeline routes to the islands; believes that the excessive length of the RET pilot scheme seriously discriminates against Orkney, Shetland, the Argyll islands and all other islands excluded from the pilot, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider its plans for the RET pilot and to replace it with an equitable distribution of any funding available to cut ferry fares across all island routes.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1681.1</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>HITRANS Supports Equal Treatment for All Island Ferries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1681) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from &quot;further notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the first step towards this wider progress represented by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision to implement its manifesto promise for an RET pilot in the Western Isles, not only for residents but also for freight and tourist traffic; recognises that all Scotland&rsquo;s island communities need to develop their transport infrastructure if they are to grow economically; acknowledges that this issue is nowhere more urgent than in the Western Isles, which has GDP per head well below that of many other parts of Scotland, and which has seen its population fall by 18% in the last 20 years, at a time when the Highlands and Islands as a whole has seen relative stability in its overall population, and recalls that when in government the Liberal Democrats declined to introduce RET anywhere, as the answer to parliamentary question S2W-15038 by the then Minister for Transport, Nicol Stephen, on 29 March 2005 makes clear.&quot;</p>
