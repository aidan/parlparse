    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-846#</b> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Additional Resources for Grampian
    Police Force</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that Grampian police in the north east of
    Scotland has one of the lowest per capita levels of resources among Scottish police
    forces; acknowledges that the Grampian force has additional responsibilities, including
    the policing of Balmoral and North Sea installations; also notes the alarming crime
    statistics in the Grampian Police force area that cannot be divorced from the low level of
    funding allocated to Grampian police, and believes that the Scottish Executive should
    allocate adequate resources to Grampian Police force for it to carry out its duties. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-845</b> <strong>Mrs Margaret Smith: Food Safety (General Food Hygiene)
    (Butchers' Shops) Amendment (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (SSI 2000/93)</strong>&#151;That the
    Health and Community Care Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Food
    Safety (General Food Hygiene) (Butchers&#146; Shops) Amendment (Scotland) Regulations 2000

    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-844</b> <strong>Richard Lochhead: ITC Report on Grampian Television</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament welcomes the Independent Television Commission&#146;s (ITC) recommendations
    and findings following complaints relating to the Scottish Media Group&#146;s (SMG)
    stewardship of Grampian Television; congratulates the staff on their campaign to safeguard
    the station&#146;s future, especially the two members of staff who were subsequently made
    redundant, and calls upon the SMG to give a positive response to the ITC&#146;s report to
    ensure Grampian Television and regional broadcasting are strengthened and prosper.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-843#</b> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Scottish Aid Agency</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament celebrates and calls for a continuation of the great work of many Scots over
    many years in working in and for developing countries, by exploring with relevant church,
    overseas aid and professional bodies the possibility of setting up a Scottish agency which
    would enable Scots of all ages to use their skills working in developing countries to
    benefit local communities, supplementing the work of existing agencies.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-842#</b> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Funding of Voluntary Projects</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should set up a fund, financed from
    existing budgets and operated in co-operation with local authorities, to enable the
    continuation of local projects providing youth, sports or community activities which make
    a valuable contribution to the Executive&#146;s programmes and face closure or major
    reduction because their funding is about to end.</p>
