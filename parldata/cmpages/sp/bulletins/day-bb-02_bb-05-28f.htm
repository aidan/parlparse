          <p><strong><a name="3156"></a>*S1M-3156</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock: 
            Nominations to the EU Economic and Social Committee</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive's wide-ranging consultation 
            with Scottish civic society to identify nominees for the forthcoming 
            mandate of the Economic and Social Committee of the European Union 
            and endorses the Executive's proposal to nominate Andy Baird (proposed 
            by STUC), Professor Grant Baird (proposed by CBI Scotland), Sandy 
            Boyle (proposed by STUC), Brendan Burns (proposed by the Federation 
            of Small Businesses), Danny Carrigan (proposed by STUC), Campbell 
            Christie (proposed by the Scottish Civic Forum), Hamish Morrison (proposed 
            by the Scottish Fishermens Federation), Bill Ure (proposed by the 
            Scottish Consumer Council) and Dr Grahame Whyte (proposed by the Institute 
            of Directors) to the UK delegation on the Economic and Social Committee 
            of the European Union for the forthcoming mandate from September 2002 
            to September 2006.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong><a name="3155"></a>*S1M-3155</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald: 
            Potential Benefits to the Scottish Economy of the Planned Energy Research 
            Institute and of the Diversification of the Offshore Oil and Gas Industry</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the decision by Scottish Enterprise to work 
            up detailed plans for an Energy Research Institute in Scotland to 
            commercialise the work of Scotland's universities across the energy 
            field; endorses the policy of support for offshore renewable energy 
            developments on the part of the Executive and the Enterprise Networks, 
            and notes the significant potential for the oil and gas industry to 
            diversify into marine renewable energy technology.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Iain Gray<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong><a name="3154"></a>*S1M-3154</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: 
            Scotland's Air Links</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance 
            of air links to, from and within Scotland for social and economic 
            development; notes with concern the current situation within Scotland 
            and, in particular, in the north of Scotland of poor international 
            connections and high internal air fares; further notes with concern 
            the high landing charges imposed both at British Airports Authority 
            and Highlands and Islands Airports Limited airports and calls for 
            action to be taken for these charges to be reduced and the competitiveness 
            of the airports increased, and calls for all aviation matters to be 
            devolved to the Parliament, for the Scottish Executive to establish 
            a route development fund to assist the development of direct routes 
            to and from Scottish airports, for and action to be taken regarding 
            the terms of the Highlands and Islands Strategic Transport Partnership 
            report into the creation of more public service obligations allowing 
            affordable and accessible air links within Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3153</strong> <strong>Fiona McLeod: GM Field Trials</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that the future of Scottish agriculture is 
            in quality produce, meeting consumer demand and reflecting its outstanding 
            environmental reputation and that, in light of scientific research 
            which raises concerns about the environmental and public health effects 
            of GM crops, Scottish Ministers should immediately apply the precautionary 
            principle and use their powers to halt the Scottish field scale trials 
            and restrict future testing to enclosed laboratories.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3152#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Westfield Landfill/Recycling 
            Plant</strong>-That the Parliament notes that since 1975 there have 
            been a number of EC Waste Directives demanding action on waste management 
            and that consecutive governments have failed to make significant improvements 
            particularly with regard to recycling; further notes that Scotland 
            currently has the worst recycling record in Europe with only 4.5% 
            of waste recycled compared to other small European countries, like 
            Switzerland, who have reached 50%; recognises that Scotland sends 
            £50 million per annum to Her Majesty's Treasury in landfill tax; believes 
            that revenue raised from landfill tax should go direct to the Scottish 
            Executive budget to support and develop the introduction of separation 
            at source recycling, waste minimisation and packaging reduction: further 
            believes that mandatory targets must be set for local authorities 
            to achieve 30% to 35% recycling rates for domestic waste by 2010; 
            is concerned that large landfill/recycling plants, such as that proposed 
            for Westfield in Fife, which will draw in waste from all over Scotland, 
            fail to meet the test of proximity, where waste should be dealt with 
            as close to its source as can be achieved, and regrets that, if the 
            Westfield proposals are agreed to, then the scale of proposals will 
            have an adverse impact on the quality of life in the local communities 
            that surround the site, on the health of children and adults resident 
            in the area and will put additional and excessive pressure on the 
            already under-funded roads and bridges infrastructure across Fife.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3151#</strong> <strong>Gordon Jackson: Epilepsy</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes with concern the 25% rate 
            of misdiagnosis of epilepsy, as identified in <em>The Misdiagnosis 
            of Epilepsy: Findings of a population study</em> (Scheepers, Clough 
            and Pickles) and <em>The Misdiagnosis of Epilepsy</em> (Smith, Defalla 
            and Chadwick); recognises and agrees that there is a need for a national 
            framework for epilepsy, as already exists for diabetes, to improve 
            standards of health care, and further notes that England and Wales 
            are working towards such a framework for 2005.</a></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3150.1</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: The Modernising 
            Government Fund</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3150) in the 
            name of Mr Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;, but recognises that the 
            delivery of first class public services also requires support to the 
            staff working in that sector, adequate funding from central government 
            and a commitment to ensure that the services remain in the public 
            sector.&quot; </p>
          <p>Supported by: Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3149.1</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
            Alternatives to Custody</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3149) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;warns against the widespread extension of 
            soft non-custodial sentences simply to empty Scotland's overcrowded 
            prisons without sufficient regard to the protection of the public; 
            notes with concern the plans paraded by the Scottish Executive to 
            send the parents of young offenders to jail, and calls upon the Executive 
            to put in place sufficient resources to make Scotland a safer place 
            in which to live and work.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3149.2</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Alternatives 
            to Custody</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3149) in the name 
            of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and 
            insert &quot;regrets the failure of the Scottish Executive adequately 
            to develop a range of high quality alternatives to custody which fit 
            the changing pattern of offending behaviour across Scotland; recognises 
            the importance of programmes which are well-resourced and available 
            across every jurisdiction in Scotland, and believes that a greater 
            element of restorative justice should be introduced into the Scottish 
            criminal justice system whether dealing with adults or young offenders.&quot;</p>
