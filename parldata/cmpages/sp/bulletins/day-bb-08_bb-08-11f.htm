<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>*S3M-2382</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Economic Situation in Unst</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE)&rsquo;s appraisal of the economic situation in Unst; notes that in 2005 the island was dealt a severe blow when the Ministry of Defence decided to leave RAF Saxa Vord, an early warning radar base that was the centre of the island&rsquo;s economy from 1957; further notes that the outlook at the time was bleak for the 720 residents of the island with a report predicting 172 job losses and gross household income falling by &pound;3.245 million; congratulates the residents of Unst, Shetlands Isles Council, HIE and Military Asset Management on their tremendous work to ensure that island life continued and prospered, and further notes that Military Asset Management has converted part of the base into self-catering accommodation and a restaurant while Foords Chocolates currently operate on the site and advanced plans are in place for the island&rsquo;s Valhalla Brewery to relocate and expand at the site, all of which helps to diversify and strengthen the economy of Scotland&rsquo;s most northerly island.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>*S3M-2381</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Good Luck to Team GB and the Beijing Olympics</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the 2008 Olympiad in Beijing and sends good luck to Team GB; congratulates the 31 Scots on Team GB for the Olympics and the 16 Scots on Team GB for the Paralympics and wishes them well; celebrates the achievements of all the athletes who will compete for Team GB; looks forward to the medals and the personal bests which will inspire others in the future, and welcomes the opportunity provided by the Olympic Games to further build links between the people of China and the rest of the world.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>*S3M-2380</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Police Make Second Largest Drugs Seizure Ever in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Strathclyde Police on making the second largest drugs seizure ever in Scotland by recovering cannabis with a reported street value of &pound;1.2 million in Inverclyde; notes that the police estimated that 1,000 plants were being grown but, since the equipment has been dismantled, four times that amount has been recovered; further notes this haul will dent the illegal drugs industry in the short-term, and commends Strathclyde Police for its dedication to removing drugs from our streets and communities.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>*S3M-2379</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Third Force News</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates <em>Third Force News </em>(TFN), Scotland&rsquo;s weekly voluntary sector newspaper, on reaching its 500th edition and its 10th anniversary; believes that TFN plays a crucial role in keeping the voluntary sector informed and in keeping members of the Parliament and others informed of news and current issues in the sector; further believes that the voluntary sector is crucial to the full breadth of Scottish life; wishes the TFN staff all the best, and looks forward to its 1,000th edition in another 10 years.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>*S3M-2378</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Anniversary of the &quot;8888&quot; Pro-Democracy Demonstration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the twentieth anniversary of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Burma that began on 8 August 1988 and during which an estimated 3,000 people were brutally slaughtered by the ruling military junta; expresses its deep concern about reports that over 2,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated in that country where they face systematic abuse and are denied proper medical care in contravention of their basic human rights; notes that an estimated 900 people have been imprisoned in the past 10 months, including many involved in the September 2007 &quot;Saffron Revolution&quot;, and commends and supports the work of organisations across the United Kingdom, including the Amnesty International Edinburgh St Mark&rsquo;s Group, in highlighting the plight of these prisoners of conscience and calling for their immediate and unconditional release.</p>
