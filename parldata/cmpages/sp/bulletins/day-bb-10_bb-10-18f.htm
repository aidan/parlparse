<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7223 Robin Harper: Statutory Employment Rights for Cultural Coordinators</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that certain local authorities in Scotland are denying culture coordinators their statutory rights to redundancy payments and abrogating other rights under employment law on termination of their contracts; notes that Unison and the Employee Assistance Programme are of the opinion that rights are being denied, and urges the Scottish Government to consult with COSLA as a matter of extreme urgency with a view to resolving this most unfortunate situation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7222 Patrick Harvie: Equal Marriage, Equal Partnership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the commitment by Ed Miliband to equalise marriage law for same-sex couples, the recent decision by the Liberal Democrat party conference to back proposals to allow same-sex marriage and mixed-sex civil partnership, the longstanding support of green parties in the UK for this position and the support that has been expressed by a number of SNP and Conservative politicians; believes that this step is necessary not only to ensure equal legal rights irrespective of sexual orientation but also to convey the equal dignity of relationships and the equal respect with which the state recognises relationships; regrets that civil partnership is portrayed by some in society as a lesser level of commitment or recognition, and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate the practical steps necessary to allow legislation in the next session of the Scottish Parliament to create equal marriage and partnership in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7221 Bill Butler: 2010 Commonwealth Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish team on what it considers to be its tremendous performance in winning 26 medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games; expresses its gratitude to the network of relatives, friends, coaches and sports administrators who supported the participants in their endeavours; thanks Delhi for the hospitality that it afforded to every competitor and visitor from across the Commonwealth; records its appreciation of the Scots involved in what it believes was the truly magnificent spectacle that followed the handover ceremony, and looks forward to extending a warm Scottish welcome to athletes and supporters from around the Commonwealth to Glasgow in 2014.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7220 Richard Baker: Security Industry Authority</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the decision by the UK Government that the work of the Security Industry Authority (SIA) should be subject to a &quot;phased transition to new regulatory regime&quot;; considers that the SIA has made real progress in reducing the level of criminality in the private security industry, encouraging the raising of standards in training and delivery in the industry and leading to an improvement in its public perception, and believes that moves to abolish the SIA threaten this progress; also considers that the SIA has successfully worked with partners in Scotland, including the Scottish Government, local authorities, police and other agencies; believes that the SIA has a key role at a time when regulation of the private security industry will be of crucial importance, in the run up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and urges the Scottish Government to engage in dialogue with the UK Government on this process and keep the Parliament informed of developments as they will affect the security industry in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7219 John Wilson: Launch of Abused Men in Scotland Charity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Abused Men in Scotland (AMIS) charity funded from the National Lottery Awards for All Scotland fund; recognises that AMIS aims to raise awareness of male victims of domestic abuse and highlight the lack of services available to meet their needs and the needs of their children; notes that figures published by AMIS show a 9.4% increase in recorded incidents of male victims of domestic abuse or violence since 2008-09; considers that, despite police statistics indicating a year-on-year increase in reported incidents of male victims of domestic abuse, there remains inadequate service provision designed to meet the needs of male victims throughout Scotland; believes that AMIS, by providing a national telephone helpline and an office in Dunfermline, is a step in the right direction to ensuring that male victims and their children receive the help that they so desperately require, and praises the collaborative approach being used by AMIS, which aims to offer specialist awareness training to organisations that have contact with male victims of domestic abuse and their families.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7216 Jim Hume: West Sound Community Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the winners of the 2010 West Sound Community Awards following a ceremony on Thursday 7 October at Ayr racecourse; notes that these awards, which are in their fourth year, are intended to celebrate and highlight the work of unsung heroes throughout Ayrshire who undertake hard work and whose achievements often go unnoticed; further notes that the winners included eight-year-old Arran Pinto, who has leukaemia, and Gavin Drysdale, who has cerebral palsy and has broken two world records, and praises West Sound FM and the sponsors who continue to make the annual staging of this event possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7215 Cathy Jamieson: Proposal to Abolish Consumer Focus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that, in the wake of the publication of the Postal Services Bill proposing what are considered significant changes to the postal market and post office network, the UK Government is proposing to abolish Consumer Focus, the statutory champion for postal customers in Scotland; acknowledges the key role of Scotland&rsquo;s post office network in both urban and rural communities and considers that the decision to remove the postal service watchdog will remove a strong voice in consumer representation, and calls on the Scottish Government to make representations to the UK Government on behalf of postal service users.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7213 Christina McKelvie: Rescue of Chilean Miners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament shares the joy and relief of Chile and the world at the successful rescue of all 33 miners trapped underground for more than two months in the San Jos&eacute; mine; has been humbled and inspired by what it sees as the extraordinary courage, stoicism and solidarity shown by &quot;los 33&quot; in the face of adversity; is moved by what it believes to be the patient vigil of their loved ones waiting in Camp Hope; pays tribute to everyone involved in mounting what it considers a highly complex and technically advanced rescue operation; recognises that their return to the surface is only the start of the miners&rsquo; recovery and readjustment, and, with the Scottish people, joins the nations of the world in sending good wishes to all the miners and their families.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7212 Gil Paterson on behalf of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee: Report on Draft Revised Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&rsquo;s 6th Report, 2010 (Session 3): <em>Draft Revised Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies in Scotland</em> (SP Paper 491), together with the <em>Official Report</em> of the Parliament&rsquo;s debate on the report, should form the Parliament&rsquo;s response to the consultation by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7211 Gil Paterson: Healthy Competition at last between Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Court of Appeal, which will force BAA to sell off either Glasgow or Edinburgh airport; believes that this decision will help smash what it considers the central belt monopoly held by BAA and be of ultimate benefit to travellers in Scotland by bringing about competition between the central belt airports, which will hopefully result in more direct flights to and from Scotland, cutting out the need for two flights, two landing charges and two sets of flight taxes, which have been a feature of BAA ownership of these airports in Scotland, and further welcomes what it sees as the environmental benefits that this will bring.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7205 Bill Wilson: Media Diversity and Democracy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that meaningful democracy depends on an educated and informed electorate and that an important element in this is a vibrant and diverse media, unafraid of voicing opinions that do not necessarily accord with the opinions of those who wield political or economic power; expresses the wish, therefore, that the UK Government oppose Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s attempt to increase his company&rsquo;s share of BSkyB, and considers that he already has several newspapers and the Fox channel and so the public are adequately acquainted with the Murdoch perspective.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7202 Dr Richard Simpson: Death of Eileen Crofton</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament mourns the death of Dr Eileen Crofton, who it considers, along with her late husband, Dr John Crofton, was a tireless campaigner for tobacco control and for smoke-free public places long before it became legislation; understands that both Eileen and John played a key role in founding ASH Scotland in 1973, with Eileen becoming the first director, and that she remained an active supporter and kept in regular contact; notes that, in 2009, the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland, in partnership with ASH Scotland, presented the inaugural Crofton Award in recognition of the achievement of young people in reducing tobacco and smoking-related harm in Scotland and in honour of Sir John and Lady Eileen Crofton&rsquo;s work over the decades in tobacco control;notes that Eileen Crofton was also very involved in how tobacco impacted on the health of women, set up the ASH women&rsquo;s committee in 1984 and remained its convenor until 1990; further notes that this later developed into the International Network of Women Against Tobacco, and considers that there has been a substantial cultural change in Scotland&rsquo;s attitude to tobacco over the past 40 years and that this is not least due to the efforts of these two notable Scots.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7201 Karen Whitefield: Congratulations to St Edward&rsquo;s Parish Church</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Edward&rsquo;s Parish Church in its Golden Jubilee year; notes that St Edward&rsquo;s parish was established on 14 October 1960 and was first led by the late Canon Tom Barry; observes that, over the last 50 years, he and his six successors have provided their congregation with comfort, leadership and pastoral care; considers that, under the present incumbent, Father Gerry Maguiness, St Edward&rsquo;s continues to make an immense contribution to the spiritual and social life of the local community, and wishes the church well in the remaining months of its Golden Jubilee year.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7199 Margaret Curran: Closure of Lightburn Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed closure of Lightburn Hospital in the east end of Glasgow and the relocation of services to both the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Stobhill Hospital; considers that this proposal will cause difficulties for many people in the wider east end of Glasgow who rely on this local healthcare facility, resulting in lengthy journeys by often unsuitable public transport; believes that local rehabilitation healthcare facilities are important in ensuring a more effective recovery; considers this a reversal of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy presumption against centralisation, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to intervene to prevent the closure and disposal of this hospital.</p>
