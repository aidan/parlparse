          <p><strong>*S2M-1304#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 
            Homeopathic Hospital</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the 
            pioneering work carried out at the in-patient unit of the Centre for 
            Integrative Care at Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital in Glasgow Anniesland; 
            notes that this service offers treatment for people with difficult 
            chronic problems and is based on a multi-disciplinary &quot;whole 
            person care&quot; model; recognises the excellent results achieved 
            and the cost-effectiveness of this approach; welcomes research that 
            clearly shows the substantial relief of suffering effected; believes 
            that this unique example of patient-centred care, education and research 
            deserves to be imitated; views with dismay reports that this service 
            is to be closed by Greater Glasgow NHS Board in order to achieve cost 
            savings; opposes any such proposal, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should support the continuation of appropriate homeopathic 
            care within the NHS.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Bristow Muldoon<strong>*</strong>, Richard Baker<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mr Kenneth Macintosh<strong>*</strong>, Ms Wendy Alexander<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mike Watson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1303</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Erskine 
            Hospital</strong>-That the Parliament commends the dedicated service 
            given by all members of staff at Erskine Hospital to the veterans 
            who reside at the hospital, some of whom were actively engaged in 
            the victorious campaign against fascism some 60 years ago; believes 
            that we all owe a debt of honour to these former members of the armed 
            services, and readily acknowledges that, at the &quot;Erskine&quot;, 
            they are as well looked after as their international compatriots in 
            the very best veterans' villages elsewhere in the Commonwealth.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1302</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>The 
            Turning of the Tide Against Nazism</strong>-That the Parliament wishes 
            to place on record its abiding gratefulness to those fellow Scots 
            who, some 60 years ago along with their compatriots from the allied 
            nations, turned the tide and destroyed the evil of Nazism and fascism 
            in Europe and, in bringing an end to that terrible war, assisted with 
            the new accord within Europe that has eventually, and not without 
            struggle of a different kind, led to the European Union of 25 nations, 
            based upon equality and fraternity that has, as one of its major aims, 
            the elimination of poverty within its member states and elsewhere 
            in the world.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1301</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Ragwort 
            Control</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the danger posed by 
            ragwort to horses, cattle and sheep; acknowledges the distress and 
            suffering caused to livestock by the ingestion of ragwort; recognises 
            the distress and financial burden such poisonings create for livestock 
            owners; welcomes, and recognises the importance of, the Ragwort Control 
            Act 2003 which covers England and Wales, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to introduce a similar measure to the Parliament at the 
            earliest opportunity.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1300#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Zero 
            Tolerance to Fire Deaths</strong>-That the Parliament recommends the 
            promotion of a culture of zero tolerance of all preventable fire deaths, 
            that is&nbsp;deaths, including those resulting from arson attacks, 
            that could be prevented by the adoption by local fire&nbsp;and rescue 
            authorities of effective planning and strategies for prevention, detection 
            and emergency intervention and considers that all fire&nbsp;and rescue 
            authorities in Scotland should work towards this goal through proper 
            strategic integrated risk management planning that combines the most 
            effective mix of prevention, detection and intervention measures aimed 
            at securing zero fire deaths.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1299</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Gulbenkian 
            Museum of the Year Award Prize</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art on winning the 2004 Gulbenkian 
            Prize for Museum of the Year with its outstanding &quot;Landform&quot; 
            landscape structure and applauds the National Galleries of Scotland 
            for&nbsp;&nbsp;its commitment to excellence and&nbsp;exciting and 
            innovative exhibitions and its contribution to the cultural life of 
            Scotland.&nbsp;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1298</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>UNICEF 
            Baby Friendly Award - Oxenward Surgery, Kilwinning</strong>-That the 
            Parliament congratulates Oxenward Surgery in Kilwinning, Ayrshire, 
            on being awarded the prestigious UNICEF &quot;Baby Friendly in the 
            Community&quot; award; notes that the surgery is the first GP practice 
            in Scotland to win the international accolade; is aware that the UNICEF 
            Baby Friendly Initiative was set up as a global programme by UNICEF 
            and the World Health Organisation to improve standards of care provided 
            for all mothers and babies; notes that in the United Kingdom the initiative 
            works with health professionals to ensure that mothers and babies 
            receive high quality support to enable successful breastfeeding; commends 
            Oxenward Surgery for holding the presentation ceremony on 11 May 2004, 
            during National Breastfeeding Awareness Week; recognises the hard 
            work of all staff at Oxenward Surgery in achieving this international 
            recognition, and hopes that many more GP surgeries in Scotland will 
            follow suit and seek to provide quality support services for new mothers 
            and babies.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1297</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            National Gallery of Modern Art and the Gulbenkian Prize</strong>-That
