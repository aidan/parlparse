            of many dedicated artists and professionals throughout Scotland, and 
            fully recognises the importance of culture in defining Scotland's

            of poverty must satisfy the requirements of being relative and comparable, 
            noting that the Scottish Executive appears to place less emphasis 
            on reducing the incidence of poverty than changing its definition; 
            is aware that the Scottish Executive is limited in its ability to 
            eliminate poverty due to the inadequacy of the powers devolved to 
            Scotland, and believes that the most effective way to tackle poverty 
            in Scotland is to ensure that all powers over tax and spending decisions 
            are transferred from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

            a fundamental review of the criminal justice system to establish how

            A9 from Perth to Inverness; recognises that the design of the A9, 
            particularly the frequent switching between single and dual carriageway, 
            contributes to this level of danger; welcomes improvements made to 
            the road design to improve safety, particularly measures already agreed 
            at the Bankfoot and Ballinluig junctions, but recognises that, until 
            the A9 from Perth to Inverness is re-constructed as a dual carriageway 
            with safe junctions, it will continue to present road safety dangers 
            to the local community and the significant number of visitors to the

            of the Titanic disaster and her efforts to tell the truth about the 
            heroic actions of First Officer William McMaster Murdoch of Dalbeattie; 
            records the gratitude of the people of Dalbeattie; supports Ms Stormer 
            in her continuing fight against a wrongful portrayal of Mr Murdoch 
            in James Cameron's film, Titanic, a portrayal that 20th Century Fox 
            eventually admitted was untrue; congratulates Ms Stormer on her latest 
            scholarly book <em>William McMaster Murdoch - a Career at Sea </em>which 
            shows that, but for Mr Murdoch's calmness and courage, even greater 
            loss of life could have occurred on the Titanic, and notes that the 
            sailor from Dalbeattie stayed to the end, going down with the Titanic 
            after giving up his life jacket to another.</p>
