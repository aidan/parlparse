    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-271#</b> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor: Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning
    Compensation for Scallop Industry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the detailed
    report of the Rural Affairs Committee on the impact of amnesic shellfish poisoning but
    believes that retrospective compensation should be forthcoming for scallop fishermen who,
    in complying with the ban, have lost their income and recommends that the Executive act on
    this immediately.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-270#</b> <strong>Brian Adam: East Coast Electrification</strong>&#151;That the

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-269#</b> <strong>George Lyon: Scallop Fishing</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    applauds the patience and good will shown by Scottish scallop fishermen and scallop
    processors who are facing severe financial hardship as a result of the ban on scallop and
    queen scallop fishing which has been in place in Scotland&#146;s Northern and Western
    waters since mid-Summer; is concerned that many fragile rural economies, and the
    communities they support, are on the verge of collapse as a result of the ban; recognises
    that the Scottish scallop fishing industry is in no way responsible for the algae which
    cause Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP), and calls upon the Scottish Executive to support
    the scallop industry through the introduction of a compensation package, a through review
    of current testing and monitoring procedures, and a commitment to work with the industry
    to safeguard its long term future.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-268</b> <strong>Robin Harper: Field Trials of GM Crops</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive not to licence further field trials of

    agriculture and to Scotland&#146;s natural heritage.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-267</b> <strong>Robin Harper: Commercial GM Crops</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive to introduce an open-ended moratorium on the
    planting of genetically modified crops for commercial purposes until they are shown to be
    safe with respect to existing agriculture and Scotland&#146;s natural heritage.</p>
