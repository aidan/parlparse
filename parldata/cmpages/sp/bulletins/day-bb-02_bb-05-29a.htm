            Benefits to the Scottish Economy of the Planned Energy Research Institute 
            and of the Diversification of the Offshore Oil and Gas Industry</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the decision by Scottish Enterprise to work 
            up detailed plans for an Energy Research Institute in Scotland to 
            commercialise the work of Scotland's universities across the energy 
            field; endorses the policy of support for offshore renewable energy 
            developments on the part of the Executive and the Enterprise Networks, 
            and notes the significant potential for the oil and gas industry to 
            diversify into marine renewable energy technology. </p>

                impact of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's recent announcement 
                of a 10% increase in taxation on the North Sea oil and gas industry; 
                is further concerned that this announcement, without any consultation 
                or published assessment of the potential impact it will have on 
                jobs and sustainable investment in the sector, could jeopardise 
                employment levels, the survival of many companies involved in 
                servicing and contracting to the industry, and the future success 
                of a vital Scottish industry which in turn could place at risk 
                any plans for effective and sustainable diversification, and therefore 
                calls for a moratorium on the imposition of this tax until a full 
                assessment is made, and published, of the sectoral and overall 
                economic impact it will have including its impact on investment 
                in diversification.&quot; </p>

                undermined by the 33% increase in corporation tax which will lead

            not resulted in any women being nominated, and invites Ministers, 
            in discussion with the other main political parties, to use their

            in light of scientific research which raises concerns about the environmental 
            and public health effects of GM crops, Scottish Ministers should immediately

                test demonstrates that such a release will cause no harm to human 
                health or the environment and, secondly, that a step by step approach
