          <p><strong>*S1M-3241</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Dog Fouling 
            (Scotland) Bill &#150; Stage I</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees 
            to the general principles of the Dog Fouling (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3240#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Health in Developing 
            Countries</strong>&#151;That the Parliament encourages academic researchers 
            and drug companies in Scotland to give a higher priority to developing 
            medicines which will promote better health and nutrition in developing 
            countries and considers that the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government should introduce inducements to progress along these lines.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3239</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Aberdeen Council Housing 
            Stock</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that over the last four 
            years more than £3 million of public money and tenants&#146; rents 
            has been spent by Aberdeen City Council in investigating stock transfer; 
            further notes that after only a few months the tenants&#146; representatives 
            on the Council Housing Options Working Group (CHOWG) rejected wholesale 
            stock transfer and repeated that rejection in the recent survey, and 
            calls on Aberdeen City Council to endorse the views of the tenants 
            without any further cost to the rents such as an expensive ballot.</p>

            with concern the threat of the permanent closure of Peebles Sheriff 
            Court; further notes that the Minister for Justice is currently considering 
            a report into the expenditure required to make the courthouse fully 
            operational and intends to make his conclusion public soon; further 
            notes that the retention of the sheriff court at Peebles is supported 
            by, <em>inter alia,</em> the Sheriff Principal of Lothian and Borders, 
            the two sheriffs who sit there, the Society of Solicitors in the Shires 
            of Selkirk and Peebles and the Faculty of Solicitors in Roxburghshire, 
            and *considers that* the Scottish Executive, in implementing its commitment
