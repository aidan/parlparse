          <p><strong>*S2M-208</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Holyrood 
            Consensus Day</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            some of the findings of the recently published <em>Scottish Elections 
            Research May-June 2003</em>, commissioned by the Electoral Commission, 
            and, in particular, the cynicism and apathy expressed by a large percentage 
            of the Scottish electorate towards the Parliament and agrees, in response 
            to the opinions expressed, to set aside a &quot;Consensus Day&quot; 
            each year for the Parliament to hold debates on subjects, chosen in 
            the usual manner, during which all MSPs will be freed from the shackles 
            of party constraints and able to vote on issues according to their 
            consciences.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-207</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Closing 
            the Pay Gap - Nursery Nurses' Grading and Pay Dispute</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament expresses concern that the nursery nurses' grading 
            and pay dispute continues and that the employers have not recognised 
            their modest and legitimate claim, one symptomatic of endemic and 
            structural discrimination against women as well as of low pay in the 
            public sector; further expresses its concern that, despite positive 
            comments from the Scottish Executive on "closing the pay gap" and 
            EU funding to address inequalities of pay related to gender, the Executive 
            has been silent on whether it supports this predominantly female workforce 
            in its long-running campaign to "close the pay gap" and gain professional 
            recognition, and therefore calls on the Executive to put "closing 
            the pay gap" into action by supporting nursery nurses in their rightful 
            claim and assisting the employers to meet it by making the necessary 
            funding available.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-206</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>The 
            Parliament's In-house Mail Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the recent announcement that its in-house mail services will 
            be transferred to the responsibility of the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body (SPCB); congratulates all members of the Royal Mail 
            staff for the professional service they have provided to MSPs and 
            staff since 1999, and urges the SPCB to consider improving the terms 
            and conditions of employment for the current Royal Mail staff based 
            in the Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Roseanna Cunningham<strong>*</strong>, Christine May<strong>*</strong>, 
            Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Ms 
            Wendy Alexander<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-205</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Proposed 
            EU Council Regulation on Recovery of Cod Stocks</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the proposal for an EU Council regulation 
            establishing measures for the recovery of cod stocks; expresses disquiet 
            at the leakage of information from the EU commissioner responsible 
            for agriculture, rural development and fisheries, Franz Fischler, 
            which appears to seek to undermine the current recovery measures, 
            and notes with concern the provisional information emanating from 
            the International Council for Exploration of the Sea on the state 
            of cod stocks in the North Sea, and elsewhere, and the possible serious 
            effect that this might have on the future catching effort.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-204</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>School 
            Holidays and Vulnerable Families</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the additional stresses and difficulties faced by vulnerable 
            and disadvantaged families during the school summer holidays owing 
            to increased daily living costs, lack of access to suitable play schemes 
            and other services and costs of leisure activities; recognises the 
            valuable role of agencies that provide play-scheme facilities, and 
            calls for an increase in affordable and accessible summer holiday 
            provision for all families that need it, the introduction of food 
            benefits for children normally in receipt of free school meals, a 
            review of the level of assistance provided through school uniform 
            grants and a review of the length and timing of school holidays.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-203</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes:</strong> <strong>Implementation 
            of Agenda for Change</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes that 
            pay modernisation in the NHS is necessary in order to address continuing 
            problems of low pay and unequal pay, which undermine the spirit of 
            teamwork on which the NHS relies and which cannot be justified in 
            a society that believes in equal pay for work of equal value; recognises 
            that addressing these fundamental issues was the basis of the negotiations 
            surrounding <em>Agenda for Change</em>; welcomes the endorsement of 
            the principles of <em>Agenda for Change </em>by a majority of members 
            of the major health service unions; further welcomes the opportunity 
            for <em>Agenda for Change </em>proposals to be piloted in Early Implementer 
            sites, including three "paper" exercises in the NHS in Scotland; recognises 
            and supports UNISON&#146;s support of a review of the outcome of the 
            Early Implementer exercise in 2004 to ensure that <em>Agenda for Change 
            </em>does, in practice, address the issues and a further ballot of 
            its health service members to approve <em>Agenda for Change </em>as 
            modified in light of the exercise; further recognises that the implementation 
            of the <em>Agenda for Change </em>proposals in Scotland after the 
            Early Implementer exercise and subsequent ballot may require additional 
            negotiation between the NHS and the health service trade unions to 
            take account of particular issues facing NHS staff in Scotland, including 
            the impact of UNISON&#146;s recent low pay deal, which raised the 
            minimum wage for NHS staff to £5.18 per hour, and the need to ensure 
            that no staff will lose financially as a result of <em>Agenda for 
            Change</em>, and calls on the Minister for Health and Community Care 
            and senior management in the NHS to continue engaging in constructive 
            dialogue with the main health service unions in order to ensure that 
            future implementation of <em>Agenda for Change </em>in Scotland incorporates 
            any changes required to reflect both the outcome of the Early Implementer 
            exercise and the particular circumstances of staff in the NHS in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-201</strong> <strong>Mr Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Battle 
            of the Little Bighorn - Monument</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the unveiling of a monument to honour 70 Lakota, Northern 
            Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors who died defending their homeland on 
            this day, 25 June 127 years ago at Greasy Grass, Montana, United States 
            of America, in the battle known as the Battle of the Little Bighorn 
            and congratulates the Government of the United States for eventually 
            providing the balance of funds to match the public donations gathered 
            over the past 20 years to build a suitable memorial.</p>
