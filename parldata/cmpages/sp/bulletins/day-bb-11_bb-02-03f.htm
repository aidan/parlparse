<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7868 Mary Scanlon: The Scottish Football Reminiscence Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the progress made by the Scottish Football Reminiscence Project; notes that this project aims to provide reminiscence therapy to people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other forms of dementia; further notes that this arose after Michael White, Falkirk Football Club&rsquo;s historian, discovered that talking through old football photos and programmes acted as a potent trigger for fans; notes that Aberdeen FC and the Hibernian historical trust assist with this project in north-east Scotland and in Edinburgh; welcomes that these stimuli have opened up discussions about players and games with patients and have greatly reduced levels of anger and frustration in the men and women taking part; further notes that Glasgow Caledonian University provided an academic evaluation of the project&rsquo;s usefulness and concluded that &quot;This kind of reminiscence work could make a major impact&quot; and that, in each instance, memorabilia are catered very specifically toward the individual with everyone attending these reminiscence meetings having their own memory pack that incorporates old programmes, photos and match reports related to their specific team; considers that any initiative that helps those with degenerative illnesses to be a welcome advance for patients and their friends and families, and recognises the scale of the problem, given that there are 72,000 people with dementia in Scotland and around 7,000 people are diagnosed with the illness every year.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7867 Kenneth Gibson: War in Congo</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is aware of the ongoing suffering in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a nation ravaged by the effects of war since the mid-1990s; considers that, despite being regarded as a forgotten conflict, the near constant state of war and chaos over the last three decades has claimed over five and a half million lives and, as such, lays claim to the tragic status of the most deadly conflict since the Second World War; considers that the people of Congo have borne witness to a most horrific series of war, rape, torture, murder and genocide since the mass influx of over one million Hutu refugees in 1994 resulted in a spate of conflicts between Congo and Rwanda; further notes that the series of wars in Congo included the armed forces of eight different African nations, Angola, Burundi, Chad, Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe plus innumerable armed militias and rebel groups, leading many to label it Africa&rsquo;s World War and the Great African War; welcomes the recent UN report on the atrocities committed by both state and non-state forces on both sides; hopes that this report is a step toward bringing the guilty parties to justice and will help Congolese society come to terms with its past and face its contemporary challenges in a manner that prevents the reoccurrence of such atrocities, and calls on the international community to focus its efforts on delivering a lasting peace in Congo.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7866 Fiona Hyslop: The Scottish Public Services Ombudsman Act 2002 Amendment Order 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Communities Committee recommends that the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman Act 2002 Amendment Order 2011 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7865 Fiona Hyslop: The Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Amendment of Specified Authorities) (No.2) Order 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Communities Committee recommends that the Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Amendment of Specified Authorities) (No.2) Order 2011 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
