          <p><strong>*S1M-3126#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Re-opening 
            of Reston Railway Station</strong>-That the Parliament supports the 
            campaign by RAGES for the re-opening of a railway station at Reston 
            in Berwickshire, the former station having closed in 1964; notes that 
            many Borderers currently commute by car to either Berwick or Dunbar 
            to then travel citywards by train; further notes that there is agricultural 
            land available for a new-build station and parking and that for a 
            small sum, in the order of £10,000, a feasibility study into the re-opening 
            of a station at Reston could be undertaken, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should commission such a study now.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3125#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: National Carers' 
            Week, 10-16 June 2002</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 10-16 
            June 2002 has been designated as National Carers' Week and welcomes 
            the opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the crucial role of carers 
            within the Glasgow Pollok constituency, in Glasgow and across Scotland; 
            recognises the central role of carers in providing support for people 
            who are frail or who have a disability which otherwise would cost 
            social and health care services in Scotland in excess of £5 billion 
            and, as shown in recent research by Carers Scotland, in contributing 
            to the broader life of local communities; accepts that the demands 
            of caring can often lead to social exclusion; invites the Scottish 
            Executive and MSPs to ensure that the role of carers is addressed 
            across all Scottish Executive departments and across the responsibilities 
            of the committees of the Parliament, and asks all those with a statutory 
            responsibility to consult and engage with carers so as to do everything 
            in their power to ensure that the expertise, knowledge and commitment 
            of carers are harnessed in the important work of securing social justice 
            for carers and those for whom they care.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Karen Whitefield<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3124#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Closure of Longannet 
            Deep Coal Mine</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the closure of 
            Scotland's last deep coal mine at Longannet in Fife; is deeply disappointed 
            that over 500 mining jobs were lost and that Scotland has also lost 
            its most valuable low sulphur coal reserve; is concerned that the 
            pit flooded at a time when Scottish Coal (Deep Mine) Ltd was experiencing 
            financial and production difficulties and that the reasons for the 
            flooding have not yet been adequately explained; is further concerned 
            that, despite the substantial public investment, in excess of £45 
            million, inadequate steps were taken by Her Majesty's Government to 
            protect the public's investment in the mine, save the jobs or retain 
            this valuable energy resource for the nation, and therefore believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should carry out a full public inquiry 
            to determine how the flooding was allowed to take place that resulted 
            in the mine's closure.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona McLeod<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3123</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Family History Societies 
            Support</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">recognises 
            the excellent work being done by the many volunteer genealogists within 
            the network of family history societies throughout Scotland, despite 
            facing problems of unsuitable accommodation and lack of funding and 
            support, and asks the Scottish Executive to consider how it might 
            best support this network as part of the geneaology tourism niche 
            market strategy.</a></p>
