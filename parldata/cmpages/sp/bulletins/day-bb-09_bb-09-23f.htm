<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4911</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Child Protection</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the <em>Summary of Indicative Quality Indicator Results</em> <em>from HMIE Inspections</em>, published on 17 September 2009, showing that 23% of local authority child protection services in Scotland were evaluated as weak or unsatisfactory; further notes with similar concern the findings of the significant case review and review for chief officers reports into the death of Brandon Muir, revealing gaps and inaccuracies in the sharing of information between agencies concerned in his care and the terrible circumstances of his life as well as death; believes that the situation highlighted by these publications cannot be tolerated in a civilised society; acknowledges and commends the efforts and dedication of staff involved in the safety and care of Scotland&rsquo;s children, often under considerable pressure but believes that these reports confound the comments of the First Minister on 25 June 2009 that we have a very good child protection system in Scotland; recognises the initiative taken by the previous administration in tackling this problem by bringing together a series of actions contained in the Hidden Harm report; calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a report and to make a statement to the Parliament on the progress that it is making in implementing the recommendations of Hidden Harm and also what it is doing to build on those recommendations, and also calls on the Scottish Government to report to the Parliament on the steps it is taking to identify those children who are at risk as a result of living with parents or carers who are alcohol or substance misusers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4910</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Teacher Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the most recent reduction in the number of teachers employed in Scotland revealed by the September 2009 public sector employment figures; further notes that this follows on from the Teachers in Scotland 2008 census, which showed that the number of teachers fell by nearly 1,000 on the previous year, and asks how this can be reconciled with the SNP&rsquo;s manifesto pledge and concordat commitment to maintain teacher numbers in the face of falling school rolls in order to cut class sizes; highlights with concern the <em>Times Educational Supplement Scotland</em> survey, published in August 2009, suggesting that only 15% of this year&rsquo;s newly qualified teachers had secured full-time permanent work at the start of the school term as well as the General Teaching Council Scotland follow up survey suggesting that, even half way through the 2008-09 school year, only around a third of the previous year&rsquo;s probationary teachers had found full-time permanent posts; believes that the Scottish Government has precipitated a teacher jobs crisis, forcing many of the most qualified new teachers in Scotland&rsquo;s history to look elsewhere in the United Kingdom or beyond for suitable employment; believes that this represents an appalling loss of talent to Scotland&rsquo;s education system and a gross betrayal of those enticed to train as teachers as well as those who voted SNP due to its election pledges on schools, and therefore calls on the SNP government to publish detailed plans of how it will deliver on its manifesto and concordat commitments on teacher numbers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4909</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen City Beautiful Scotland Awards Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the result of the Beautiful Scotland Awards 2009, which saw Aberdeen win the City Award and Aberdeen City Council collect the Institute for Sport, Parks and Leisure (ISPAL) Scotland Trophy; congratulates the council and its officials for their hard work and effort in securing these prestigious awards, and wishes Aberdeen every success in the 2010 Britain in Bloom Awards in which it will represent Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4908</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>2009 Greenspace Survey</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the results of the 2009 survey undertaken by Greenspace Scotland that shows that 63% of Scots use their local greenspaces every week, up from 49% five years ago, and that 86% agree that it is important to have a greenspace in their local area; further notes that the most popular uses of greenspaces are walking, relaxation, exercise and play, all of which contribute to an individual&rsquo;s health and wellbeing; believes that this amply demonstrates the importance of greenspaces and the need to maintain and improve them so that everyone has easy access to well managed greenspaces, and urges government at all levels to ensure that the provision of well managed greenspaces is given a high priority along with work to encourage people from all backgrounds and ages to make full use of their local greenspaces.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4906</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Beautiful Scotland Awards Winners 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Cumbernauld Village on its award of a bronze medal certificate in the Urban Community Category of this year&rsquo;s Beautiful Scotland Awards; further congratulates the communities of Condorrat, Caldercruix and Glenboig, which also received bronze medal certificates, and Kilsyth on its award for the best new entry in the same category; notes the hard work and dedication on the part of community bodies and representatives who have applied for the awards and helped decorate and maintain their areas to such an award-winning standard, and encourages local communities to continue developing their sense of civic pride and to keep Scotland and their local areas beautiful for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4903</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Smoking Bans Cut Heart Attacks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to note that studies suggest that heart attacks are cut by almost one third by smoking bans; also notes the findings that this &quot;heart gain&quot; is much greater than earlier studies have suggested and that heart attack rates drop for three years following smoking bans, going from a 17% drop in the first year to 36% after three years; is pleased that Scottish figures bear this study out, with a 17% drop in heart attacks in the 12 months after the smoking ban was implemented, and is delighted that the cumulative effects of the 2006 smoking ban are still being felt.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4901</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>150th Anniversary of St Aloysius Parish in Chapelhall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Aloysius Parish in Chapelhall on the occasion of its 150th anniversary; recognises that the parish has played an important part in the life of the community of Chapelhall over this period of time; pays tribute to the commitment shown to the community by all of the parish priests, from the first, Father James Milne, to the present, Father Michael Walsh; recognises in particular the important part that the parish has played in the education of young people in the community, and wishes the parish well in its year of celebrations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4900</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>No to Savage Cut to Child Benefit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the suggestion by Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg that, as part of a package of savage cuts, child benefit, a universal benefit with a high uptake and paid directly to mothers, be made subject to means-testing and considers that such a savage cut would fall on mothers and children, adding to child poverty and inequality for mothers and that, by such a measure, children and mothers would effectively be made victims of a banking financial crisis for which they were not responsible.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4899</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Students are Overstretched and Overdrawn</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the report by NUS Scotland, <em>Overstretched and Overdrawn</em>, showing that the majority of students are in some form of debt, with over half suffering from commercial debt; notes the finding that students from lower socio-economic backgrounds (NS-SEC classes 4-7) are more likely to be concerned about commercial debt; further notes the finding that 70% of students are being forced to work more than the 10 hours a week limit recommended in the Cubie report while studying full time; expresses concern at evidence showing clear failings in current child care support, and calls on the Scottish Government to use the &pound;30 million considered in the <em>Supporting a Smarter Scotland </em>consultation to increase student loans, bursaries and improve childcare support system for students in Scotland, as called for by NUS Scotland, student associations across Scotland and the main opposition parties.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4898</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Macmillan Cancer Support, World&rsquo;s Biggest Coffee Morning</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Macmillan Cancer Support&rsquo;s annual World&rsquo;s Biggest Coffee Morning event, which will be held at venues across the United Kingdom on and around 25 September 2009; notes that Macmillan is expecting over 4,000 coffee mornings to be held across Scotland, raising around &pound;880,000, with every penny going towards helping people affected by cancer; further notes that every day 822 people in the United Kingdom are told that they have cancer and that charities such as Macmillan provide practical, medical, emotional and financial support while pushing for better cancer care, and urges people to visit <a href="http://www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee" target="_blank">www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee </a>to find the nearest coffee morning&nbsp;that they can attend.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4896</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Patients in Scotland being Required to Pay &pound;900 Prescription Charges for Drugs for Infertility Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses profound concern that NHS patients are being asked if they will pay &pound;900 for drugs to assist with their infertility treatment and that patients in Fife are being told not even to ask to go on the waiting list because by the time they reach the top of the list they will no longer be eligible under the criteria for treatment and regrets that many young couples are to be left with a childless future owing to the lack of action and disregard by the Scottish Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4895</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Stirling University Named Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the University of Stirling on being named by <em>The Sunday Times</em> as Scottish University of the Year 2009-10 and notes that this accolade comes on top of being ranked first in the Research Assessment Exercise 2008 for sports research and for nursing and midwifery research, best in the United Kingdom for a &quot;good place to be&quot; in the International Student Barometer for 2007 and 2008 and first in Scotland for sports facilities and services in <em>The Times Good University Guide 2008</em>.</p>
