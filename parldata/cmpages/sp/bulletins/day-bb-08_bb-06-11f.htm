<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2121</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Bus Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes more effective implementation of regulatory arrangements is needed to improve the quality, affordability and accessibility of bus travel; considers that resources are needed by local authorities and regional transport partnerships to permit them to complete the action points in the Bus Action Plan, vital if more people are to be encouraged to use buses rather than cars; expresses concern about the sharp increase in fares throughout Scotland caused by increasing fuel prices and the SNP government&rsquo;s decision not to increase the Bus Services Operators Grant in line with the rebate provided by the UK Government to bus operators in England and Wales; calls on ministers to promote through-ticketing, to seek a review of the Competition Commission&rsquo;s stance on the level of communication that can occur between public transport operators on issues such as timetabling which would assist greater integration with other forms of public transport and to review penalty clauses in rail and ferry contracts which inhibit multi-modal travel; determines in principle, in the interests of inclusion and social justice, to extend eligibility for concessionary travel to people with learning disabilities and other disabled people in receipt of the lower rate of disability living allowance, and calls on Scottish Ministers not to defer this change until the completion of the three-year review of the National Concessionary Travel Scheme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2120</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Education Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the lack of confidence expressed by parents, teachers, primary and secondary heads, and directors of education in the SNP government&rsquo;s handling of Scottish education; notes with concern the cuts in education provision across Scotland; calls on the First Minister to clarify the cost and timescale for delivery of his class-sizes pledge, made on 5 September 2007, when he promised the Parliament that his class-sizes pledge on primaries 1 to 3 would be met in the lifetime of this parliament; recognises the growing number of teachers coming to the end of their probationary year who are either unable to find a teaching post or who are forced into taking part-time or temporary employment; worries that if this trend is allowed to continue unchecked, it will undermine the internationally recognised success of the teacher induction scheme, and calls for immediate action from Scottish Ministers to address the impending jobs crisis.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2119</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Public Health etc. (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Public Health etc. (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
<p>Groups 1 to 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 minutes <br />

<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2109</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Skills and Training Charter for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the future of any country lies in the skills of its people; welcomes the development of the Skills and Training Charter for Scotland for the engineering construction industry, and wishes to record support for its continued success and development.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2108</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Supporting Men&rsquo;s Health Week 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports National Men&rsquo;s Health Week 2008 which runs from 9 to 15 June; congratulates Men&rsquo;s Health Forum Scotland for raising the profile of men&rsquo;s health; believes that closer attention should be paid to men&rsquo;s health with emphasis on prostate and testicular cancer, alcohol and drug dependency, heart disease, sexual health and diabetes; notes that this year&rsquo;s theme is Men at Work, and urges everyone to get involved in the many events being held up and down the country to raise awareness of men&rsquo;s health issues.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2107</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Welcome U-Turn</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s u-turn on its final demand for over &pound;5 million worth of debt from around 2,500 postgraduate students; believes that postgraduate students have been put through needless grief due to government incompetence; notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s original position was that continuing to allow deferment was not possible due to &quot;accounting procedures&quot;; welcomes the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning&rsquo;s response to political pressure and bad headlines; believes that this demonstrates that where there is political will the Scottish Government can seemingly find a way; further believes that the Scottish Government should therefore similarly u-turn on proposals for a local income tax that will hit over 55,000 full-time students, on changes to means testing for current students that will reduce government support for up to 17,000 students previously assessed as being from single parent families and on &pound;12 million of efficiency savings from the student support budget over the next three years.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2107.1</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Welcome U-Turn</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2107) in the name of Claire Baker, leave out from first &quot;u-turn&quot; to end and insert &quot;decision to close the legislative loophole left by the previous administration which would have required immediate repayment of the graduate endowment by postgraduate students; believes that it was wrong of the previous administration to fail to legislate for the position of postgraduate students faced with the graduate endowment tuition fee; further believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning&rsquo;s actions represent speedy and decisive action by a government committed to the principle of free education; recalls that it was the Labour Party that abolished free higher education in the first place, and urges all parties in the Parliament to support the principle of free education.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2106</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Newlands and People Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates unreservedly Newlands Community Development Trust on securing &pound;1 million from the National Lottery to build a community centre attached to the existing school at Romano Bridge, thus helping secure the future of Newlands Primary School; applauds the community for its determination and inventiveness in its long struggle to resist closure of the local school by Scottish Borders Council; wishes the trust every success in the future, and commends it as a model of people power and an example to communities resisting rural school closure elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2105</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Post Office Closure Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its opposition to the Post Office closure programme, an irrational, haphazardly executed plan to hastily scale back the Royal Mail Group even though it provides social cohesion for many of our communities; recognises that one-third of Prime Minister Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP&rsquo;s cabinet have tried to save branches in their own constituencies, the same Labour ministers who, without foresight, voted in favour of the programme and considers this position to be hypocritical; insists that the UK Government ends this ongoing lack of direction by clarifying its long-term intentions for the postal network and allays the ongoing fear of additional closures yet to come; seeks protection for the universal service obligation, vital for Scotland&rsquo;s large number of rural communities, and a speedy update of the Code of Practice on Post Office Closures; joins the Business and Enterprise Select Committee of the UK Parliament in calling for compulsory attempts at replacing sub-postmasters who retire; joins the committee in noting the lack of co-ordination between regulators and the UK Government with respect to the social impact of withdrawing payment systems from the network; urges the Department for Work and Pensions to award the card account contract, a service of fundamental importance to the whole economy, to Post Office Ltd (POL), as any other decision could devastate the network as the service is used by more than four million customers and represents a vital foothold for sub-postmasters and believes that POL is the best and most accessible provider of this service anyway; supports the Royal Mail, as it tries to regain confidence with the business community, local councils, who are making existing offices more sustainable and attempting to put work their way, and rural churches, who have not been included in the stakeholder information network but are able to contact and represent many of the more vulnerable and excluded members of the community; opposes the relatively short duration of public consultations, effectively making it difficult for many voluntary organisations to participate meaningfully in the decision process, which also falls below the eight-week minimum specified in the UK Cabinet Office best practice guidance; rejects observed proportionality in closures, which exacerbates existing levels of disadvantage, with outreach services often open for only two hours weekly, which is unacceptable for those who, due to inclement weather conditions, may have to wait weeks for an opportunity to collect their pensions, and considers that outreach services that are unable to accept postal packets weighing more than 2kg, which is a considerable inconvenience, has a negative impact on local business and defies the universal service obligation, which extends to packages up to 20kg in weight; appreciates the role played by Postwatch in the pre-consultation stage although seeks greater openness from POL in this stage to enable greater opportunity for changes to be made later on; seeks more limited confidentiality, given the substantial public investment in the network and keen public interest in the outcome; is concerned with POL&rsquo;s execution of the closure programme, noting evidence of intimidation, claims of bad practice, and allegations from local councils that POL ignored information necessary to properly implement the access criteria and determine whether offices were Disability Discrimination compliant; regrets that POL has not been prompt nor definitive in responding to government reports and that POL did not engage properly with local MPs from the outset of the programme; questions the motives behind the closure programme when outlets could simply be developed, thereby creating a real and sustainable solution rather than closing them; further rejects recommendations by Postcomm for the partial privatisation of Royal Mail by reducing the universal service obligation and also rejects the closure of offices with an attached shop that together represent the last remaining outlet in a community, noting that several such closures have taken place; opposes the closure of financially profitable offices, which may have taken place but cannot be confirmed due to POL&rsquo;s lack of financial transparency and low public confidence; agrees with independent reviewers who state that opening up the postal market to competition has led to no significant benefit for consumers while at the same time has hurt the elderly, the infirm, and those without transport, and hopes that UK ministers will appreciate the complex nature of, and wide-ranging benefits arising from, the postal network, which seemingly, as experienced so often under Labour, have been disregarded.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2104</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Nature of Farming Biodiversity Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Patrick Bowden-Smith from the East Neuk of Fife on winning the inaugural Scotland Nature of Farming Award; notes that the RSPB has teamed up with <em>BBC Countryfile Magazine </em>and with Butterfly Conservation and Plantlife to create this new Nature of Farming award which celebrates the fantastic work that our farmers already do for wildlife; recognises that the award is made through a vote by the public on the BBC&rsquo;s Countryfile website and is the largest biodiversity award in the United Kingdom, and notes that it seeks to reward farmers who are taking action for wildlife and to highlight to the general public the work that our farmers do for nature.</p>
<p>Supported by: Helen Eadie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2103</strong> <strong>Christopher Harvie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Balwearie High School, Kirkcaldy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils, staff and community of Balwearie High School, Kirkcaldy, on receiving an outstanding assessment from HM Inspectorate of Education; notes that awards in the sciences were much higher than the national average and across the school the population of pupils who entered higher and further education was significantly above national averages; further notes that, in particular, Balwearie High School is to be commended on the care taken to reach out to groups with learning difficulties, to develop links with Europe and to incorporate the wider civil society in its educational programme, and recognises that this echoes the ideas of a great educationalist in Fife of the 1950s and 1960s, R F Mackenzie of Templehall School, Kirkcaldy, and Braehead School, Buckhaven and assures the county of the adaptability of its educational system to meet environmental challenges and new technologies.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2102.1</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Small Business Bonus Scheme</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2102) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the introduction of the Small Business Bonus Scheme (SBBS) on 1 April 2008; recognises that business rates relief schemes play a part in government support for small business; notes also the schemes initiated by previous administrations but believes that the allocation of a further &pound;315 million, over the period of this spending review, to the implementation of the SBBS does not by itself represent the most effective way of stimulating local economic development or national economic growth, and further believes that government funding targeted on energy efficiency, training and town centre regeneration would benefit both small businesses and their local communities.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2102.2</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>Small Business Bonus Scheme</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2102) in the name of Jim Mather, insert at end &quot;; welcomes the acceleration of the business rate reductions announced during the Parliamentary budget process, and calls on the Scottish Government, local authorities and business organisations to work together to ensure that eligible businesses are aware of and benefit from the reductions.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2102.3</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Small Business Bonus Scheme</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2102) in the name of Jim Mather, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish Government to commission an independent assessment in 2010 of the impact and effectiveness of the current and previous administrations&rsquo; business rate reduction measures.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2077</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Centenary of the Vatersay Raiders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that it is 100 years since the 10 fishermen from Barra and Mingulay, who sought to establish crofts as a way of life on Vatersay, appeared at the Court of Session in Edinburgh accused of breaching an interdict imposed upon them by the absentee landlord, Lady Gordon Cathcart; notes that their two month imprisonment caused an outcry across Scotland, leading the Government to buy Vatersay for crofting; further notes that today the descendants of the raiders still live on Vatersay with a causeway now linking them to the larger island of Barra, built in order to avoid abandonment by the population of Vatersay as befell Mingulay, and notes that it was the Labour-led Scottish Executive that led the way in introducing land reform measures to give communities such as Gigha and South Uist greater control of their land and how it is managed and giving them greater power to shape their own futures, following the example of the Assynt crofters and the people of Eigg and Knoydart.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2077.1</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Centenary of the Vatersay Raiders</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2077) in the name of David Stewart, leave out from &quot;notes that it was&quot; to end and insert &quot;therefore calls for a review of the land reform legislation passed by the Parliament in 2003 to ensure that it works as intended, that it has the full support of government policies to establish sustainable living conditions attractive to families and communities in the 21st century in all parts of Scotland and recognises the right of Scots to live in their own land whether on rented or owner-occupied family holdings.&quot;</p>
