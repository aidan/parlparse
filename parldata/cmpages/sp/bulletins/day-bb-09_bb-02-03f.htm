<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3366</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>Welcome to Conference on Trident and International Law</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Christopher Weeramantry, former vice-president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to Scotland for his address on the legality of nuclear weapons at the conference, Trident and International Law: Scotland&rsquo;s Obligations, which expands on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s and Scotland&rsquo;s responsibilities arising from the 8 July 1996 ICJ advisory opinion that &quot;the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law&quot;, and welcomes the conference&rsquo;s review of the application of international law with regard to the renewal of Trident by the UK Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3365</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>BBC Scotland Young Traditional Musician 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Nairn-based fiddler Ruairidh Macmillan on winning the BBC Scotland Young Traditional Musician of the Year for 2009; praises all six finalists on their skill and talent, and wishes them all every success in keeping the traditional musical heritage of Scotland alive and vibrant.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3364</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>End the Inhumane Long-distance Transportation of Live Horses for Slaughter in Europe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the practice of the long-distance transportation of live horses for slaughter into and across the European Union (EU) involving an estimated 100,000 horses each year; believes that such a practice is indefensible in terms of animal welfare; also believes that existing legislation relating to such transportation and its enforcement are inadequate; supports an early review introducing short finite journey limits and space allowances that reflect the welfare needs of horses and, thereafter, rigorous enforcement by all EU member states of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005, which governs the transport of live vertebrate animals within the EU in connection with an economic activity, and supports the Make a Noise campaign by World Horse Welfare to end the inhumane transportation of horses within the EU.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3363</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Catholic Education Week 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates Catholic Education Week, intended to highlight the significance of education for young people and society as a whole; notes that Catholic Education Week may present an invaluable time for reflection on the importance of education; recognises the contribution of Catholic education in promoting values-based education in schools and setting high standards of academic excellence; considers that the achievements of Catholic education can be recognised throughout the east end of Glasgow, where the standard of education has risen as a result of the influence of Catholic education, and hopes that standards of education in the east end of Glasgow will remain a priority and continue to improve.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3362</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Budget (Scotland) (No.3) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Budget (Scotland) (No.3) Bill.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3361</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Freedom of Dumbarton for Jackie Stewart</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposal that West Dunbartonshire Council should award Dumbarton-born racing legend Sir Jackie Stewart the Freedom of Dumbarton; recognises the immense contribution that the three times world motor racing champion has made to Scottish sport, and believes that this would be a fitting tribute to a &quot;son of the rock&quot; and one of the world&rsquo;s most famous Scots as he approaches his 70th birthday.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3360</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Lighting Up the Inauguration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aggreko plc, the Dumbarton-based generator company that had the honour of providing the power services for the inauguration of the new President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, in Washington DC; recognises that Aggreko plc is a global leader in the rental of power generation equipment and that this is the third time that it has performed such a service at a presidential inauguration; welcomes Aggreko&rsquo;s decision to expand its operation in Dumbarton, and wishes it every future success.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3359</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Sustaining Emergency Services at the Vale of Leven Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the development of the GP-led model of emergency care at the Vale of Leven Hospital; commends local GPs for their efforts in trying to retain as many services as possible locally; further notes, however, that more people will have to travel to Paisley for services including coronary care and treatment for strokes, gastrointestinal bleeds and epileptic seizures; acknowledges that for the model to work effectively and be sustainable in the long term it requires the active support of consultant physicians from the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; understands that concerns have been expressed by all of these physicians in their response to the publication of <em>Vision for the Vale of Leven Hospital</em> to the extent that they do not support the model and believe that &quot;the vision is flawed&quot;, &quot;it provides a two tier service for patients&quot; and they &quot;would not wish any of their relatives cared for under these circumstances&quot;; consequently believes that even if NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde managed to convince these consultant physicians to support the GP-led emergency service at the Vale of Leven Hospital that, given their underlying attitude, there are very serious questions about its sustainability, and therefore calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to consider retaining anaesthetics at the Vale of Leven Hospital and, failing that, to deliver a north of the river solution using the Golden Jubilee Hospital together with the Vale of Leven Hospital to provide services for an enhanced catchment area.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3358</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Nairn Fiddler Wins Young Trad Musician Title</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ruaridh MacMillan of Nairn who has won the title of BBC Scotland&rsquo;s Young Traditional Musician of the Year for 2009 in the final at Celtic Connections on 1 February 2009; recalls that he has shown determination from a young age to excel as a fiddler; welcomes the continuing strength of traditional music throughout Scotland as exhibited by the keen competition, and notes the continuing strength of the entrants to the competition from the Highlands and Islands.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3357&diams; </strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Support for Unpaid Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vital role played by unpaid carers across Scotland in providing essential care and support to people whose lives are seriously affected by illness or disability and the work done to support carers by the Voice of Carers Across Lothian (VOCAL) in Edinburgh and the Coalition of Carers in Scotland; notes that the estimated replacement cost for unpaid carers in Edinburgh has increased by &pound;98.3 million to &pound;554.5 million; is concerned that one in five carers has given up work to provide care, the same proportion suffer poor health, only 40% have had a break from their responsibilities of more than two days and 73% live in fuel poverty, and therefore considers that the contribution made by unpaid carers to the Scottish economy should be recognised by improving the sharing of best practice in the provision of support with other European countries and local authorities across the United Kingdom and by improving the quality of support available for respite care, training, support services and young carers in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3356</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Report of Services to Protect Children and Young People in Inverclyde</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) report on services to protect children and young people in the Inverclyde Council area; notes that the report indicates that there is joint working within and across services, including the voluntary sector, and involvement of children and families in reviewing and developing services; further notes that, of the 18 quality indicators, the Inverclyde Council area achieved 15 very good, two excellent and one good evaluation, and acknowledges the hard work and dedication of all the staff who have helped achieve such a positive report.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3355</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Support Barony Chambers Restoration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports East Dunbartonshire Council&rsquo;s grant funding application to Historic Scotland to help with the restoration of Barony Chambers in Kirkintilloch, built in 1814-15 and which has served as a town hall, council chambers, courthouse, school and jail, being a grade B building of special architectural and historic interest and arguably one of the most important historic monuments in Kirkintilloch.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3354</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Alloway Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the new Alloway Primary School; believes that this will provide a modern and positive learning environment for pupils and much improved teaching environment for staff; congratulates the pupils who provided superb entertainment at the opening ceremony, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that South Ayrshire Council has the necessary funding to ensure that all pupils have the opportunity to be educated in a facility that is of similar quality.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3353</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Sandwick Junior High School Big Energy Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the final of the Big Green Challenge debating competition was held in the Parliament on 30 January 2009, when Sandwick Junior High School, Gairloch High School, Portree High School and Arran High School debated important renewable energy motions; recognises that the hard work all the teams will have put into the competition in researching renewable energy reflects the importance of renewable energy to the Highlands and Islands; congratulates all the teams on their success in reaching the final of this prestigious competition; particularly congratulates Sandwick Junior High School and its team of Joe Christie, Ceidiog Saxelby and Saibh Finlayson for winning the competition, and hopes that they will enjoy their prize, a trip to Iceland, which will include a visit to the Blue Lagoon and to the geothermal area of Geysir.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3333*#*</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Congratulating Project Linus UK</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that Project Linus is a 100% volunteer non-profit organisation that aims to provide a sense of security and comfort to children who are seriously ill, traumatised or otherwise in need, through gifts of new, homemade, washable blankets and quilts created by volunteer blanket makers; congratulates Project Linus on producing 75,000 quilts and blankets in the United Kingdom since April 2000 and specifically commends the Lanarkshire branch, which delivered 748 quilts and blankets in 2008 and has delivered a total of 2,508 since the creation of the group in 2004, and considers involvement with the organisation either by making quilts or donating materials and supplies to be extremely worthwhile and worthy of encouragement.</p>
