            train drivers in England; notes that ScotRail is to receive a further

          <p><strong>S1M-2861</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: School Repairs 
            Fund</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the considerable outstanding 
            repair bill faced by Scottish schools; notes that in some cases schools 
            have been allowed to fall into an unacceptable state of disrepair, 
            simply because local authorities cannot afford the necessary investment 
            for improvement; draws attention to Greenhill Primary School in Coatbridge 
            as an example of a school whose major repair requirements have provoked 
            a crisis, and calls on the Executive to provide an emergency fund 
            so that councils are able to bring schools up to a decent standard 
            so that our children are taught in safe and comfortable surroundings.</p>

            the press reports on the latest revelations concerning Henry McLeish&#146;s 
            constituency office; calls for a full publication by Fife Council 
            of their report and for an independent inquiry into this scandal; 
            further calls for the resignation of Henry McLeish as an MSP while 
            he draws a high pension of £34,000 a year for 13 months&#146; work 
            as First Minister, and calls for an investigation into the awarding 
            of this pension while hundreds of thousands of pensioners barely survive 
            on less than £10,000 per year after a lifetime of work.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2859</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Eurostar: A Return 
            for our Money</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with disappointment 
            the Strategic Rail Authority&#146;s failure to secure a link from 
            Scotland to the continent within its current ten year plan, despite 
            a Court of Session ruling three years ago, and calls on the Executive 
            to support Strathclyde Passenger Transport in securing this link as 
            soon as possible to pass on some of the benefit currently enjoyed 
            by the south east of England, particularly considering that Scotland 
            has paid its fair share toward this project but has received no benefit 
            in return.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2858</strong> <strong>John Scott: Ayr Scottish Eagles</strong>&#151;That

            Ayr Scottish Eagles, Scotland&#146;s only superleague ice hockey team, 
            on their victory in the Blue Square.com Challenge cup final; further 
            congratulates the team on its second place finish in the Sekonda Ice 
            Hockey Superleague and resultant qualification for European competition 
            next season and wishes the team every success in the forthcoming play-off 
            competition; recognises the popularity of ice hockey as a spectator 
            sport in Scotland, and calls on SportScotland to afford a higher priority 
            to the sport in order that clubs may develop the wealth of young talent 
            in the country with a view to participation in future Winter Olympic

            recognises the rights of landfill site operators to use their sites 
            as licensed, but nonetheless notes with concern the intention of some 
            local authorities in Northern Ireland to use Scottish landfill sites 
            for dumping their putrescible waste, and further recognises that in 
            the long term this is likely to impact adversely on Scottish council 
            tax payers, as Scottish landfill resources are used up by non-Scottish 
            local authorities using Scotland as their dumping ground.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2856</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Don't Kill Safiyat 
            Hussain</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls for the quashing of

            Sokoto State, Nigeria on Mrs Safiyat Hussain, a 35-year-old woman 
            and nursing mother, for allegedly committing adultery; notes that 
            this decision will be appealed on 18 March 2002 and that Safiyat Hussain&#146;s 
            defence is that she was raped by a man in her village, that he was 
            acquitted as there was no witnesses to the alleged assault, yet she 
            was found guilty as she was pregnant; believes that Safiyat Hussain 
            should be freed, and calls for her immediate acquittal and freedom.</p>

            in the suggestion that Ayr United Football Club has taken up a lease 
            of Hampden Park given the amount of time spent there these days and 
            urges the Scottish Executive to make a swift and positive decision 
            on the Ayr United football stadium planning application so that Ayr 
            can compete for a place in the Scottish Premier League.</p>

            families from across Scotland; notes that the development of a second

            of the many individuals and organisations who have contributed to 
            the development of this project, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should work in partnership with CHAS, NHS boards, local authorities 
            and the Scottish Partnership Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care 
            to ensure that these services are supported effectively.</p>

            continuing budgetary difficulties and threatened cuts in services, 
            and believes that Ministers should meet representatives of the council 
            with a view to maintaining services, with particular regard to education, 
            voluntary services and key community facilities.</p>

            the Parliament notes research findings by Help the Aged indicating 
            that over 50% of Scots in the 65-74 age group feel that the country 
            treated older people as if they were &quot;on the scrap heap&quot; 
            and &quot;a burden to society&quot;; believes that such treatment 
            is unacceptable and perpetuates ageism in society, which can be seen 
            in both deliberate and inadvertent discrimination in the attitudes 
            of both public and private sector organisations, allied to continued 
            media stereotyping of older people, and therefore considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should identify and address areas of age discrimination 
            in Scottish public life so that older people feel valued and can make 
            a full and positive contribution to society.</p>

            in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that there are 
            750 known deafblind people in Scotland, but that Deafblind Scotland 
            and Sense Scotland estimate that the total figure is more likely to 
            be around 2,500; further notes the introduction of guidance under 
            section 7 of the Local Authorities and Social Services Act 1970 on 
            9 March 2001 in England and Wales, which requires local authorities 
            to be pro-active in their efforts to serve deafblind people and, in 
            particular, to (a) identify and record the number of deafblind people 
            in their area, (b) ensure that an assessment of their needs is carried 
            out, (c) ensure that appropriate services are provided for deafblind 
            people, (d) ensure access to specially trained one-to-one support 
            workers, (e) provide information in formats accessible to deafblind 
            people and (f) ensure that deafblind issues are included as part of 
            one senior manager's responsibilities; recognises that this has represented 
            a major breakthrough for deafblind people in England and Wales, and 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should examine the current provision 
            of services for deafblind people in Scotland and look into ways of

            Edinburgh; recognises the strategic significance of this area for 
            the whole of Scotland and its economy; notes the importance of the 
            proposed new National Planning Policy Guideline in balancing transport, 
            economic and environmental requirements while ensuring the continued 
            protection of the green belt, and, in particular, acknowledges the

            the importance of the role that sub-post offices play in Scottish 
            communities, particularly in rural areas and deprived urban areas; 
            recognises the potential financial consequences for sub-post offices 
            in Scotland of the UK-wide Automated Credit Transfer system for the 
            payment of benefits; notes that &quot;Your Guide&quot; is a comprehensive 
            information service currently being evaluated for sub-post offices 
            in England and Wales; further notes that such a service includes Government 
            General Practitioner and Internet Learning Access Point initiatives, 
            both of which provide members of the public with the ability to interact 
            with departments of Her Majesty&#146;s Government and gain government 
            information in an accessible way; further recognises the potential 
            benefits that such a service could provide in Scotland, in terms of 
            improving openness and public participation with government, as well 
            as potentially providing a timely boost to business levels for sub-post 
            offices at a time when the network is having difficulty in sustaining 
            such levels, and considers that the Scottish Executive should pilot 
            such a scheme in Scotland, with a view to rolling out the service 
            across the country as soon as possible. </p>

            at present owing to the goodwill of Sierra Leonean friends and small

            such drugs in controlling children and the diagnosis and treatment 
            of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and supports the immediate 
            setting up of an independent research project into attention deficit

            Borders Council who require some £3-4 million to avoid swingeing cuts
