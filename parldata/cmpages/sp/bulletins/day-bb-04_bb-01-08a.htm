          <p><strong>S2M-762</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Delivering 
            a Quick, Effective Youth Justice System</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the importance of dealing quickly, firmly and effectively 
            with the minority of young people who offend; acknowledges that progress 
            has been made by local authorities and partners in the statutory and 
            voluntary sectors to encourage rehabilitation, prevent reoffending 
            and tackle and reduce youth crime, but recognises that further work 
            must be done to ensure that the quality of life in our communities 
            continues to improve. </P>

                &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;however notes 
                with concern the contents of the Audit Scotland report, <em>Dealing 
                with Offending by Young People</em>, published in November 2003, 
                that too many children placed on supervision for reasons of offending 
                are not receiving the required level of service and considers 
                that efforts to encourage rehabilitation and prevent re-offending 
                are being undermined as a result; further notes that the shortage 
                of places in secure units constrains the ability of children's 
                hearings to make the most appropriate decisions, and considers 
                that the Scottish Executive must guard against complacency and 
                redouble its efforts to provide both the leadership and resources 
                that will enable its partners in local authorities and the voluntary 
                and statutory sectors to make the progress required to deliver 
                an appreciable reduction in youth crime&quot;. </P>

                to motion (S2M-762) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end; 
                &quot;; in particular considers that at the heart of effective 
                youth justice is the Children's Hearings system; calls, therefore, 
                for the Children's Hearings system to be better resourced with 
                a wider range of disposals in order that hearings can perform 
                a more effective role in relation to youth justice and assist 
                in the wider function of community mediation, and further calls 
                on the Scottish Executive to alleviate the burden on the Children's 
                Hearings system by sending persistent 14 and 15-year-old offenders 
                to youth courts, while keeping 16 and 17-year-olds in adult courts.&quot;

                housing associations gives tenants far more say in the way their 
                housing is run, giving tenants greater rights and responsibilities, 
                and therefore believes that, to improve the standard of housing 
                for everyone in Scotland, it is necessary to step up the process 
                of devolving control of housing from local authorities to community-based 
                housing associations, housing co-operatives or a range of other

                from local authority housing stock since 1997; believes that such 
                ongoing loss is unsustainable, and calls for a replacement of 
                the right to buy scheme with a right to rent discount scheme to 
                reward long-term tenants while protecting local authority and 
                housing association stock and for the implementation of a programme 
                of sustained investment in local authority housebuilding to build 
                at least 10,000 new units a year to reverse the disastrous decline
