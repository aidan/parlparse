<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7617 Kenneth Gibson: Green Gym</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the continued work being done by the Kilbirnie Green Gym volunteers in their ongoing projects in the Garnock valley area of North Ayrshire; recognises what it considers to be the success of the recent completion of the Bridgend Community Centre Gardens project in Kilbirnie; believes that the Green Gym volunteers display a positive attitude towards the values of sustainability, health and wellbeing and community spirit; commends what it sees as the volunteers&rsquo; resourcefulness and success in securing donations as well as utilising recycled materials in order to beautify the local community; welcomes the Green Gym as a project in which people of all ages can increase their activity levels, become fitter, improve social skills and improve their overall health and wellbeing, and wishes the partnership of Healthy North Ayrshire and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers the best of luck as they expand their Green Gym initiative across the Garnock Valley.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7616 Kenneth Gibson: Disability Benefit Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled by the decision of the UK Government to scrap a series of benefits for disabled people including the Independent Living Fund and the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance; recognises that the Independent Living Fund directly supports 3,654 disabled people in Scotland to help them live independently in the community rather than in residential care; further condemns the scrapping of the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance, which also affords disabled people the ability to live independently of carers by providing them with a small budget to help with transportation costs or running their own vehicle; recalls plans by the Labour Party earlier this year to scrap both Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance to pay for the creation of a National Care Service only for those in England and Wales; recognises that independent analysis by the Institute for Social and Economic Research predicted that the removal of Attendance Allowance would result in over 67,000 disabled people in Scotland being forced into poverty, and considers that the unionist parties at Westminster have a track record of picking on the poorest and most vulnerable people in society in an attempt to rectify the negative outcomes of their own financial ineptitude.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7615 Kenneth Gibson: Citizens Advice, Consumer Issues</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes publication of Citizens Advice Scotland&rsquo;s (CAS) report, <em>Advice in Detail - Consumer Issues</em>; recognises the expert advice that it considers CAS provides to the people of Scotland through its 80 branches across the country; notes that a 2009 poll showed that one in five members of the public had visited a Citizens Advice Bureau in the previous three years; believes that during this time of austerity CAS has provided an invaluable service that aided Scots on a number of important issues including 69,097 consumer debt issues, over 24,000 utility and communication issues, almost 18,000 financial product issues and nearly 17,000 consumer goods and services issues in the year 2009-10; further recognises that 98% of people trusted CAS and were satisfied with the service that they received, and judges CAS to be an essential service provider that should receive the continued financial support of the Scottish Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7614 Patrick Harvie: National Day of Protest against Welfare and Housing Benefit Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the National Day of Protest against Welfare and Housing Benefit cuts on Wednesday 15 December 2010 and applauds all of those involved in peaceful protest on this day; believes that Scotland will be hit hard by these changes, since over 84% of Scotland&rsquo;s councils will see households losing &pound;30 a month or more in housing benefit; expresses grave concern that households affected by these changes will become trapped in a spiral of debt and be placed at greater risk of rent arrears, eviction and homelessness; believes that the Scottish Government is simply implementing what it considers the UK Government&rsquo;s unprecedented, unnecessary and ideologically driven cuts agenda without undertaking any concerted action to raise revenue, and therefore urges it to reconsider its own cuts to Scotland&rsquo;s housing and regeneration budget, which has been the single biggest loser in its draft 2011-12 budget.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7613 Murdo Fraser: Perth City Status 2012</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2012 will mark Her Majesty the Queen&rsquo;s diamond jubilee; understands that, as part of the celebrations to mark this, there will be a United Kingdom-wide competition to bestow city status on one settlement and that the closing date for applications is set for 27 May 2011; notes that, although considered to be a historic city, Perth does not share legal city status on a par with Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling; understands that Perth&rsquo;s general public, businesses and civic society all strongly support official city status and believes that it would boost Perth&rsquo;s national standing and the local economy; considers that official city status would reflect Perth as being one of Scotland&rsquo;s leading places for business, education, art, culture and sport, and supports Perth&rsquo;s bid to become a city during Her Majesty the Queen&rsquo;s diamond jubilee.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7612 Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell: Restrictions on Sport and Athletics in Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the contents of the open letter sent to Michel Platini, President of UEFA, on 20 November 2010 from Palestinian footballers, coaches and athletes regarding the current situation in Gaza, where sports and athletics have been disrupted and sporting facilities damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombardments and where Palestinian footballers, sportsmen and women and athletes are reported to have been prevented from participating in events outwith Gaza by Israeli authorities on the grounds that they pose security risks; notes that the letter commends Mr Platini for stating that Israel must choose between allowing Palestinian sport to continue and prosper or be forced to face the consequences for their behaviour, while expressing dismay that this is not currently being permitted; calls on international organisations such as UEFA to apply pressure on Israel to end what it considers to be this oppression, and recognises the work of Scottish Friends of Palestine and other Scotland-based organisations for advocating the rights of Palestinians and raising awareness of their cause and rights.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7611 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Committee Remit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the remit of the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee be amended to&mdash;</p>
<p>To consider and report on (a) matters relating to transport and infrastructure falling within the remit of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth and (b) matters relating to climate change falling within the remit of the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7610 Patrick Harvie: Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions on Grounds of Sexual Orientation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision on 16 November 2010 by the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee of the United Nations to remove a reference to sexual orientation from a resolution on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions; recognises that in many countries lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, as well as transgender people, remain at risk of execution as a result of prejudiced laws and public attitudes; congratulates the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Australia, New Zealand and many European countries for voting to retain the reference to sexual orientation; welcomes the commitment of Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, to restore this reference when the resolution is discussed by the General Assembly, and urges the global community, in opposing all extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions, to recognise that prejudice on grounds of both sexual orientation and transgender identity are being used as justification for what it sees as offensive and unacceptable actions.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7609 Jackie Baillie: Coalition Attack on Disabled People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by the UK Government to withdraw the Independent Living Fund (ILF); understands that the UK Government  plans to phase out the &pound;359 million fund by 2015; notes that the Independent Living Fund supports more than 21,000 severely disabled people by providing, on average, &pound;300 a week; regrets that the UK Government will now not accept any new applications to the ILF; welcomes the comments by Lord Morris, the first person to occupy the post of Minister for Disabled People, who stated that this move would not save money; regards the withdrawal of ILF as an attack on disabled people, and calls on the UK Government to change its mind and continue the ILF.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7608 Patrick Harvie: North Kelvin Meadow Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those at the North Kelvin Meadow Campaign on their It&rsquo;s Your Neighbourhood Award from Beautiful Scotland; notes that this award places the meadow in the Thriving category of project awarded; deplores the present proposals from developers, which it considers would destroy this thriving area, and applauds Beautiful Scotland for recognising the efforts of all those involved in the campaign to make the meadow such a special and beautiful green space that benefits an entire community.</p>
<p>Supported by: Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7607 Nanette Milne: Royal Blind, National Braille Week 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates National Braille Week 2011, which takes place from 4 to 10 January; congratulates Royal Blind on its National Braille Week art exhibition, being held at the Royal Bank of Scotland branch at 36 St Andrew Square, Edinburgh, which showcases visually impaired artists&rsquo; work and celebrates the importance of Braille; considers that blind and visually impaired people play an active and important role in society and contribute positively in all walks of life; further considers that the ability to read and write in Braille opens the door to literacy, intellectual freedom and independence; supports Royal Blind&rsquo;s call for a greater recognition of Braille as essential to enabling opportunity, equality and access for all, and congratulates Royal Blind for the role that it plays in improving the lives of visually impaired and blind people and in providing core services, including the work of the Scottish Braille Press.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7605.1 John Lamont: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7605) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;the progress made&quot; to end and insert &quot;that, while progress is being made across a range of areas in improving community safety, the public must continue to be encouraged to report antisocial behaviour and that where examples of good practice exist these should be replicated as widely as possible.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7605.2 Robert Brown: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7605) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;; believes that local policing is key to community safety; notes the work underway through the Sustainable Policing Project on protecting frontline policing and the delivery of outcomes for communities, and believes that community safety is unlikely to benefit from the establishment of a single Scottish police force.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7605.3 James Kelly: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7605) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;which shifts&quot; to end and insert &quot;; regrets, however, that it has taken 20 months to publish the report and that it will be 2012 before a proper evaluation of the framework is complete;  believes that this demonstrates a complacent attitude on the part of the Scottish Government toward antisocial behaviour; recognises that antisocial behaviour continues to blight the lives of many throughout Scotland, as witnessed by the 240,696 antisocial behaviour offences recorded in the Scottish Policing Performance Framework annual report of 2009-10; regrets that the number of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBO) granted fell from 437 in 2006-07 to 249 in 2009-10 despite the number of complaints increasing, and calls on the Scottish Government to adopt a more proactive attitude in tackling antisocial behaviour and to listen to the views of local people and support a policy of giving community councils and properly constituted residents groups the power to apply to local authorities for an ASBO.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7604.1 Jackson Carlaw: Winter Resilience</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7604) in the name of Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;, and further calls on the Scottish Government to give consideration to a traffic-light style graded system of severe weather warnings.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7604.2 John Swinney: Winter Resilience</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7604) in the name of Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;, and acknowledges the significant efforts made by a wide range of public service workers, voluntary organisations and people across Scotland to maintain essential services, support their neighbours and keep communities moving through the extreme conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Keith Brown<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7604.3 Jeremy Purvis: Winter Resilience</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7604) in the name of Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;; regrets the damaging economic and reputational impact of the severe disruption to Scotland&rsquo;s roads, rail services and airports and the Scottish Government&rsquo;s poor handling of the exceptional weather conditions; recognises that difficulties are ongoing; believes that there are several practical steps that could be taken to help avoid such disruption in the future, including for Transport Scotland to carry out more comprehensive scenario planning, for rail operators to review the preparedness of the network and their communication with passengers and for the Scottish Government to facilitate closer co-operation between trunk road operators, the police service and local authorities in their efforts to keep essential routes open and the public advised, and believes that the Scottish Government should outline the measures that it is taking to rebuild confidence in Scotland&rsquo;s ability to remain open for business under adverse weather conditions.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7433*#* Robert Brown: Fighting Visual Impairment and Age-related Macular Degeneration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of eyesight to a full life; understands that age-related macular degeneration (AMD) accounts for over half of registered blindness; is concerned that the prevalence of AMD is set to grow markedly with the increasing age profile of the population *in Glasgow and the rest of Scotland*; notes that treatment for AMD requires repeat application of appropriate treatments, commonly a regime of eye injections, but that outcomes are good if diagnosed early, and believes that it is vital that NHS boards are able to meet demand for treatment effectively now and in the future.</p>
