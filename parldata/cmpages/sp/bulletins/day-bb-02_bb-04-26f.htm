          <p><strong>*S1M-3038</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Inverness 
            and District Friends of ARMS</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Inverness and District Friends of ARMS group on its successful bid 
            for NHS Highland funding; notes the group's efforts in the delivery 
            of an invaluable physiotherapy service to Inverness and the rest of 
            the Highlands; welcomes the fact that the provision of an MS specialist 
            nurse will be additional to the direct funding; recognises the part 
            played by the MS Society Scotland, and undertakes to keep the issue 
            of specialised, rural health provision at the forefront of national 
            debate.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3037</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson: Motherwell Football 
            Club</strong>-That the Parliament notes with alarm the current crisis 
            at Motherwell Football Club; recognises that it is a symptom of the 
            financial crisis in the professional organisation of Scotland's national 
            game and that the current structure of its organisation is unsustainable; 
            appreciates the importance of Motherwell Football Club to the Scottish 
            game and to the people of Lanarkshire as well as the needs of the 
            employees of the club; acknowledges and further appreciates the many 
            attempts made by the outgoing ownership at Motherwell to invest in 
            the club and the game, but recognises that such investment is unsustainable 
            unless the overall structure of the Scottish professional game is 
            sustainable and viable, and calls for all leaders of Scottish Football 
            to consider a wide-ranging and radical overhaul of the structure of 
            the Scottish game and leagues in order to ensure competitiveness at 
            all levels and the growth of community-based clubs encouraging domestic 
            talent and to ensure that there are opportunities for clubs to grow 
            and progress through the leagues from all levels and, if necessary, 
            to move on to larger, non-domestic leagues if that is to their financial 
            and sporting advantage. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3036</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: A90 Dualling from 
            Tipperty to Balmedie</strong>-That the Parliament notes the dangerously 
            high levels of congestion on the A90 north of Aberdeen, the expected 
            increase in traffic from the proposed new housing developments which 
            will rely on this route and the poor accident record, and calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to upgrade the single carriageway Tipperty 
            to Balmedie stretch of the A90 to dual carriageway.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3035</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: PGCE Secondary 
            Courses in Geography, Drama, Biology and Chemistry at Jordanhill Campus</strong>-That 
            the Parliament deplores the decision of the Scottish Executive to 
            direct the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to limit the 
            recruitment of students at Jordanhill Campus of the University of 
            Strathclyde in the areas of geography, drama, biology and chemistry 
            to not more than 85, having the month before indicated to the University 
            that they should expect to recruit some 175 such students, a decision 
            which has resulted in the University issuing 136 legally binding offers 
            for such courses for which they will now receive funding for only 
            85; notes that the Principal of the University of Strathclyde has 
            described the Executive's decision as "capricious and ill-considered", 
            and calls upon the Executive to review its decision.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3034#</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson: Meares-Irlen 
            Syndrome</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes that 
            Meares-Irlen syndrome affects up to one-third of all young people 
            and, in the worst cases, has a serious impact on their learning in 
            the early years; further notes that, for many children, its effects 
            can be mitigated by colour overlays or lenses but that the facilities 
            within the Scottish health service to diagnose and treat this syndrome 
            are few and far between, and therefore considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should work with the NHS and the education authorities to 
            ensure early diagnosis of this syndrome and to put in place cost-effective 
            methods of treating it. </a></p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3032.1</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Scotland and 
            Europe Day</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3032) in the name 
            of Irene Oldfather, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out from &quot;encourages&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;looks forward to this relevance being enhanced
