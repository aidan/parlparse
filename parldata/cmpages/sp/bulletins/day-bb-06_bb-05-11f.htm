<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4376</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>The Coach House Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the achievement of the 25% recycling target for Scotland and believes that the achievement of this target and the ambition of reaching 30% by 2008 can be achieved only through the empowerment and co-operation of commercial, public, and voluntary organisations; applauds the efforts of the Coach House Trust, which operates a vital scheme in the west end of Glasgow, particularly given the poor overall roll-out of recycling in Glasgow; expresses concern about recent changes in the funding arrangements managed by INCREASE which have resulted in a reduction of the grant available to the Coach House Trust recycling project, thereby threatening the continued viability of the project; regrets that the provision of specialist assistance for smaller, non-commercial schemes through the Community Recycling Network Scotland and the Strategic Waste Fund has become increasingly difficult to access and unreliable for match-funders, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do more to assist the smaller providers directly and so better contribute to a genuine community response to the recycling targets.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4375</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade Town Status for Livingston</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Livingston on obtaining Fairtrade Town status and becoming the second town in West Lothian to achieve this status; recognises the hard work of Livingston Fairtrade Committee, West Lothian Council, civic organisations and churches in achieving this status; notes the growing support for fair trade products in Scotland and the benefits that this will bring to farmers and  communities in developing countries; encourages other towns across the country to consider becoming Fairtrade towns, and also encourages everyone to buy fair trade products.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4374</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Action Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Action Group on gaining the Charter Mark Award for customer service excellence for the second time; notes that this is the Action Group&rsquo;s 30th year of providing high quality care and support to children and adults with learning disabilities and other support needs across Edinburgh and the Lothians; recognises that the essential support provided allows many people to enjoy a good quality of life in the community; notes also that the Action Group has received the Investors in People Award for the third time, and welcomes the continued commitment of the Action Group&rsquo;s 340 staff and volunteers to the provision of such a vital service.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4373</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Local Sports Facilities and Reform of the Law of Trusts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive for its commitment to and investment in both elite and community sports facilities but notes with concern the threat to Dowanhill Lawn Tennis Club in the west end of Glasgow which was set up by way of a public trust to the benefit of the people of Dowanhill; condemns the actions of the club committee, many members of which do not live locally, in refusing membership to local families in order to ease the sale to a developer for the creation of flats; calls on the Executive to consider expanding the powers of the Lord Advocate, or other appropriate body, to protect the beneficiaries of a public trust; notes the current lack of remedies available to beneficiaries who, as in the case of small community groups, are not able to draw on considerable financial resources; calls on the Scottish Law Commission to review the law of trust and ensure that there is an affordable mechanism to challenge breach of trust, and finally requests that Tennis Scotland and <strong>sport</strong>scotland lend their support to the Dowanhill Tennis Action Group&rsquo;s campaign to ensure that the Dowanhill site is preserved for the recreational use for which it was originally bequeathed and not exploited for the financial benefit of the few.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4370.2</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Drugs and Hidden Harm</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4370) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from first &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that in 2002 the current First Minister, formerly minister with responsibility for children, said that the Executive and relevant agencies had three years to get their collective act together on child protection; recognises that child protection issues generally, including the increasing number of cases where drugs misuse is a factor, are complex and need thought-through policy solutions and concerted action for delivery, and calls on the Executive to redouble its efforts to complete implementation of the child protection recommendations contained in the 2002 report, <em>It&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s job to make sure I am alright,</em> which it committed to fulfil but which are still outstanding, and to ensure that it adopts a comprehensive policy approach to proposed legislation for child protection, adoption and fostering and children&rsquo;s hearings which puts the child at centre stage and which addresses support for kinship care, listens to children and to professionals in the field and also addresses support services where current spend on children&rsquo;s services by local authorities on average far exceeds GAE allocation to a disproportionate extent.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4370.3</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Drugs and Hidden Harm</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4370) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &quot;; recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;and to that end guarantees to investigate properly alternative regimes that aim to reduce the harm done by drug abuse and stabilise the lifestyle of persistent drug abusers; acknowledges the important role of kinship carers in helping to safeguard and nurture children who have been affected by substance misuse and recognises this role by financially recompensing them to an agreed national standard, and supports the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to further improvements in the way that agencies protect and support children in these circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4367.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Scottish Enterprise</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4367) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the time has come for Scottish Enterprise to be restructured, refocused and slimmed down, with the savings made being invested in transport infrastructure improvements and reductions in the business rate which would deliver real benefits to all businesses across Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4367.2</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Scottish Enterprise</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4367) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;views&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the important role of Scottish Enterprise in supporting the growth of the Scottish economy; endorses the strategic direction set by ministers for Scottish Enterprise in terms of business growth, regeneration and local development initiatives, training, skills and maximising international opportunities; welcomes the steps taken by the Scottish Executive to secure effective financial management by Scottish Enterprise in the future, in particular the commissioning of the robust report by KPMG and the commitment to the implementation of its recommendations; welcomes the additional non-cash resources to be made available to Scottish Enterprise, and confirms the important role that Scottish Enterprise will play in contributing to the growth of the Scottish economy.&quot;</p>
