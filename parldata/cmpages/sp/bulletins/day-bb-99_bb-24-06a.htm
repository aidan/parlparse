    Services&#151;</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">S1M-67 Mr Alex Salmond: </b>That the Parliament condemns the
    privatisation of health, education, transport and other public services through the
    Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) schemes; notes the
    mounting body of evidence that PFI and PPP, introduced by the Conservative Government and
    continued by the Labour Government, are an inefficient and expensive method of funding
    vital public services which also undermine the pay and conditions of public service staff;
    calls upon the Scottish Ministers to disclose the annual expenditure commitments
    associated with each public project involving private finance, and the rate of return that
    private partners receive for the capital that they commit; urges the Scottish Ministers to
    examine alternatives to such private financing, and calls on the Scottish Ministers to
    bring forward proposals to introduce Scottish Public Service Trusts.</p>
