                        authorities of people in hospital and at home who have 
                        been assessed as needing residential and nursing home 
                        care but for whom no funding is available; recognises 
                        that home care services are inadequate to enable them 
                        to safely stay within their own home; notes that most 
                        of the additional funding announced by the Minister for 
                        Health and Community Care on 5 October 2000 will not be 
                        introduced until April 2001 and therefore calls upon the 
                        Scottish Executive to bring forward proposals as a matter 
                        of urgency to address these issues before the onset of 
                        winter. </font></p>
