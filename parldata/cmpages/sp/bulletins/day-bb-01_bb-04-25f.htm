            <strong>Sarah Boyack: Rural Transport</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes 

            the Executive’s commitment to improving transport in rural Scotland, 

            notes the progress that has been made by investing in lifeline air 

            and ferry services, rail and bus services, community transport, petrol 

            stations and roads that serve remote and rural communities, and recognises 

            the vital role that these record levels of investment play in improving 

            people’s lives in rural Scotland.</font></p>

            Elder: "Freedom from Pain" Campaign</strong>—That the Parliament endorses 

            wholeheartedly the aims of the &quot;Freedom from Pain&quot; campaign 

            by CancerBACUP; applauds the &quot;Freedom from Pain&quot; Charter 

            and urges all MSPs to sign it; supports CancerBACUP’s view that the 

            management of cancer pain in Scotland and in the UK must be improved 

            radically; further supports the view of the proposed Cross Party Group 

            on Chronic Pain that a radical transformation of the plight of patients 

            who are in chronic pain for any reason, including non-malignant disease, 

            must be addressed urgently given that there are 500,000 people in 

            Scotland who suffer chronic pain from all kinds of conditions, including 

            back and arthritic pain, and notes the huge support of health professionals 

            and charities for the proposed Cross Party Group on Chronic Pain and 

            also the support given to CancerBACUP’s &quot;Freedom from Pain&quot;

            serious problem caused to industries and individuals in Scotland through 

            high fuel costs; further notes the additional burden that the foot-and-mouth 

            disease crisis has placed on industries and areas vulnerable to high 

            fuel prices; recognises that notwithstanding the changes in the Budget 

            announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, fuel costs in Scotland 

            remain the highest in the developed world and are set to rise further 

            towards £4.00 a gallon; therefore calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer 

            to reduce immediately fuel taxation by 10 pence per gallon and thereafter 

            to move to a fairer system of taxation and ensure a harmonisation 

            of fuel prices with our European competitors, and calls upon the Scottish 

            Executive and Her Majesty's Government to take action to end the disparity 

            of fuel prices in rural Scotland.</font></p>

            changing global economic circumstances, a sustainable future for Scotland 

            is dependent on a high skills, high value knowledge economy; recognises 

            that significant skills shortages have been allowed to develop in 

            key sectors in the Scottish economy; regrets that, to date, government 

            has neither quantified nor predicted these shortages, far less been 

            able to take action to fill the skills shortfall, and therefore calls 

            upon the Executive to take immediate action to identify and quantify 

            Scotland’s current skills shortages and likely future shortages, tailor 

            investment in skills to meet current and future demands and shortfalls 

            and work closely with industry to assure a demand-led integrated approach 

            to training, further and higher education.&quot; </font></p>
