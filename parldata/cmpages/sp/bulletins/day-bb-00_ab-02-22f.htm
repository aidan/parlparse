    possibly in conjunction with the Finance Committee, into EU funding arrangements,
    particularly regarding structural funding and additionality.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-572</b> <strong>Dennis Canavan: European Union documentation on lifting of
    Indonesian arms embargo</strong>&#151;That the European Committee requests the Clerk to the
    Committee to investigate why the Committee did not receive any EU documentation on the

    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-571</b> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Airdrieonians Football Club</strong>&#151;That

    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-570#</b> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Milk in Schools</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with concern that almost one third of children go to school without
    breakfast; recognises the importance of milk at mid-morning break in providing hungry
    children with calories, protein, essential vitamins and minerals necessary for growth and
    bone density; acknowledges that hungry and nutritionally deprived children can lack
    energy, have low concentration, display lethargy and be difficult to teach and even
    disruptive; believes school based nutrition to be vital for the achievement of rising
    standards in education and commends local authorities such as Edinburgh, Glasgow and South
    Lanarkshire in this regard while encouraging all Councils to provide and promote a choice
    of whole and semi-skimmed milk, ideally with fruit, for all nursery, primary, secondary
    and special school children; recommends discontinuing the practice of exclusive contracts
    for fizzy drinks machines on school premises, and furthermore seeks the assistance of MEPs
    in securing the reinstatement of European Union subsidies for secondary school milk,
    catering milk and cheese and raising of the semi-skimmed milk subsidy to that of whole
    milk.</p>
