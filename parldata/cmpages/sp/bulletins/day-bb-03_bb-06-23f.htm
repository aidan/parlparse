          <p><strong>*S2M-184</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Anniversary 
            of the Battle of Bannockburn</strong>&#151;That the Parliament celebrates 
            the anniversary of the victory at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 
            June 1314 when King Robert the Bruce led his 13,000 troops, who were 
            outnumbered 3 to 1, to victory against Edward II's army of 40,000 
            troops, marking a victory of lasting importance in the destiny of 
            Scotland as an independent nation, and urges the Scottish Executive 
            to ensure that all children of Scotland, whatever their colour, creed 
            or background, learn of this seminal event in their nation&#146;s 
            history, an event that inspired the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320 
            with words affirming the sovereignty of the Scottish people above 
            all else, words that have reverberated through the centuries and across 
            nations and that affirm the democratic supremacy of the people, wherever, 
            or whoever, they are.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-183</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Central Borders 
            Citizens Advice Bureau</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes and 
            congratulates Central Borders Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) on another 
            year of invaluable work on behalf of its clients in dealing with 9,594 
            issues in 2002; applauds the work of its volunteers and its liaison 
            with both Roxburgh and Berwickshire CABs; expresses concern that its 
            fixed level of funding cannot keep apace with rising costs and, in 
            particular, the severe and increasing burden of water charges which 
            has led it to initiate a "Friends of Central Borders CAB" with the 
            intention of raising much-needed funding, and therefore urges the 
            Scottish Executive to examine ways and means of assisting Central 
            Borders CAB, and other bureaux, with increasing costs and, in particular, 
            with savage water charge increases.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-182#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne: Ten Years of Council 
            Tax</strong>&#151;That the Parliament considers the impact of the 
            operation of the council tax following its 10th anniversary; notes 
            with concern the 80% increase in the tax over these 10 years; acknowledges 
            that pensioners&#146; incomes rise more slowly than those of working-age 
            people as pensioners&#146; incomes rise only in line with prices, 
            which grow more slowly than earnings, thereby placing an unfair burden 
            on older people; recognises that the council tax accounts for an average 
            *15%* of pensioners household income compared with 3% for working-age 
            households, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should 
            take action to reduce the financial misery faced by less well-off 
            pensioners.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-181</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Animal Welfare 
            Centres</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
            decision to hand all responsibility for animal welfare to its Environment 
            and Rural Affairs Department; recognises that the Scottish Society 
            for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been calling for such 
            a move since 1999, and believes that this will end confusion and allow 
            animal welfare issues to be dealt with more effectively.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-180</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Greater Glasgow 
            NHS Board Withdrawal of Beta Interferon</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the decision of Greater Glasgow NHS Board to cap 
            the number of sufferers of multiple sclerosis (MS) who will be treated 
            with beta interferon, the drug widely thought to offer respite to 
            MS sufferers and provide them with the best chance of a normal life; 
            further notes the statement by the Scottish Executive on 4 February 
            2002 that &quot;the NHS will pay for the cost of beta interferon and 
            similar drugs for all qualifying patients in Scotland&quot;, and considers 
            that the Executive should make urgent representations to the board 
            and take all possible measures to ensure the necessary resources are 
            put in place to guarantee that all MS sufferers in the board area 
            receive the treatments they require.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-179</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: The Future of 
            the Scottish Legal System</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            the views expressed by Lord Hope, at present a law lord and past President 
            of the Court of Session, that, if the supreme court proposed by the 
            Prime Minister becomes part of the Royal Courts of Justice, it cannot 
            have jurisdiction over Scottish courts which are protected by the 
            Treaty of Union; further notes that Scottish civil cases can be appealed 
            to the House of Lords whilst Scottish criminal appeals cannot be so 
            appealed; calls on the Minister for Justice to engage in consultations 
            with Scottish judges, the legal profession, organisations concerned 
            with advising the public on legal issues and MSPs on the implications 
            of the Prime Minister&#146;s proposals for the Scottish legal system, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the views of the 
            Scottish Parliament, and not the United Kingdom Parliament, on the 
            future of the Scottish legal system are paramount.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-178</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson: Defenders of 
            Human Rights - PREDA</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the outstanding 
            work of the PREDA Foundation, the People&#146;s Recovery Empowerment 
            and Development Assistance Foundation Inc., founded by Father Shay 
            Cullen in 1974 and working for human rights and protecting young people 
            from being exploited by the sex industry in the Philippines; further 
            notes with concern the increasing threats and harassment being experienced 
            by those working to protect sexually abused and exploited children 
            within the Philippines, and calls on the Government of the Philippines 
            to act on behalf of the Defenders of Human Rights and implement Article 
            12.2 of the UN Paris Declaration of 1998.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-177#</strong> <strong>Mr Jeremy Purvis: European Structure 
            Funds and South of Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the importance to the south of Scotland of European structural funds; 
            welcomes the investment of £44 million in projects such as the Ettrick 
            Riverside Centre, Selkirk, the Eastgate Arts Centre, Peebles, the 
            Border Union Showground, Kelso and harbour investment in Eyemouth; 
            appreciates the efforts of agencies working in partnership to deliver 
            a full spend of the allocated funding, and stresses the importance 
            of the continuation of such funding after 2006, whether delivered 
            from Brussels or repatriated.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-176</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Human Rights Abuses 
            in Chechnya and Visit of President Putin</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the ongoing conflict in Chechnya; expresses profound concern 
            at the findings of Amnesty International that human rights abuses, 
            including disappearances, extra-judicial executions and torture, are 
            perpetrated on a daily basis by Russian forces on Chechen civilians, 
            and wishes to communicate this concern in the strongest possible terms 
            to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, during 
            his visit to Edinburgh.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Shona Robison, Shiona Baird, Mr Rob Gibson, Christine 
            Grahame, Tricia Marwick, Mike Pringle, Patrick Harvie, Alex Neil,

          <p> <strong>S2M-175</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: Visit by President 
            Putin and Human Rights Abuses in Chechnya</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, 
            is visiting Scotland as a guest of the Scottish Executive and invites 
            the Executive to raise the issue of the treatment of Chechens who, 
            according to a recent report by Amnesty International, have been subjected 
            to gross violations of their human rights, including torture, rape 
            and executions by the Russian army.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Colin Fox<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-174#</strong> <strong>John Scott: Paediatric Services 
            in Ayrshire</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the considerable 
            concern in Ayrshire regarding the current review of paediatric services 
            in the area; hopes that this review will be brought to a speedy conclusion, 
            and further notes that there is a clear wish on the part of local 
            people for the retention of the two paediatric units at Ayr and Crosshouse 
            hospitals.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-173#</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Ending Alcohol 
            Ban at Sports Grounds</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            ban on the sale of alcohol at Murrayfield Stadium and at football 
            grounds as a result of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980; recognises 
            that this ban was a necessary response to disorderly behaviour at 
            football grounds at that time; further recognises, however, that, 
            as behaviour has improved as a result of the introduction of seated 
            stadia and improved crowd control, this ban has served its purpose 
            and is now having a detrimental effect on the finances of football 
            clubs and Scottish rugby, and therefore believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should lift the ban at Murrayfield and all fully-seated 
            football grounds as part of a liberalisation of licensing law.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-172</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: BBC Frontline Scotland 
            Programme "Stop Chewing the Fat"</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            congratulates the BBC Frontline Scotland on the excellent programme 
            broadcast on 17 June 2003, &quot;Stop Chewing the Fat&quot;; notes 
            that the programme makes a strong case for free, nutritionally balanced 
            school meals in Scotland, based on evidence from Finland, where such 
            meals have been a central part of their successful campaign to improve 
            the nation&#146;s health and have resulted in a 65% reduction in rate 
            of coronary heart disease; notes that 11 of the 12 members of the 
            Scottish Executive&#146;s advisory committee on healthy eating approached 
            by the programme favour the idea of free school meals, and informs 
            MSPs that this programme will be shown in committee room 2 at 10:30 
            am on 24 June 2003 as part of the launch of the free school meals 
            bill to be introduced by Rosie Kane.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-171</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle: Anonymous Electoral 
            Registration</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that, since motion 
            S2M-91 on electoral registration and victims of domestic abuse was 
            lodged, the Electoral Commission has published a report, <em>The Electoral 
            Register Process</em>, which recommends that anonymous registration 
            be introduced for electors who are able to demonstrate that there 
            is a genuine threat to their safety; welcomes the acknowledgement 
            that victims of domestic abuse can be placed at risk if their name 
            appears on the electoral register; further notes that the report has 
            been submitted to the Deputy Prime Minister, and urges Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government to introduce legislative changes as soon as possible to 
            allow the earliest benefit from this proposed anonymous registration 
            process.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-167</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Escalating Costs 
            of the Parliament Building</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls 
            for the inquiry into the escalating costs of the new Parliament building 
            to identify both the politicians and senior public servants responsible 
            for the current crisis; believes that those responsible should be 
            required to resign or be disciplined, including the relevant finance 
            ministers who approved the increased costs; further calls for the 
            bill for the new Parliament building to be sent to Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government, where the original decision and flawed contract was decided, 
            and believes that the people of Scotland should not see their essential 
            public services cut to pay for this white elephant.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-166#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Macmillan/CAB 
            Cancer Patient Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            Macmillan Cancer Relief and the citizens advice bureaux of Lanarkshire 
            on the innovative service that they have developed for cancer patients, 
            providing debt assistance, employment, housing and other benefits 
            to cancer patients and their carers; recognises that this is an excellent 
            example of effective partnership working between voluntary organisations; 
            commends Macmillan Cancer Relief and Airdrie Citizens Advice Bureau 
            on the success of the pilot project in Airdrie; wishes them well as 
            the project is rolled out across Lanarkshire, and recognises the benefits 
            that such a service could provide across Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-165</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Mis-selling 
            of Gas and Electricity</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            recent survey by the Trading Standards Institute that revealed that 
            as many as 1.4 milion households in the UK have suffered bad experiences 
            from energy salespeople; further notes that energy companies such 
            as Scottish Gas have taken over people&#146;s accounts without their 
            permission; believes that mis-selling of gas and electricity is unacceptable, 
            and supports Energywatch&#146;s "Stop Now" campaign, which aims to 
            restore consumer confidence by condemning high-pressure doorstep sales.</p>

            Ferguson&#146;s Shipyard, Port Glasgow, is one of the very best shipyards 
            in Europe and believes that it is of the utmost importance, for both 
            the economy of the lower Clyde and the Scottish shipbuilding industry, 
            that the Scottish Executive does all in its power to ensure that the 
            management and workforce at the yard are given every encouragement 
            to bid for orders that, going by the yard's excellent record, would

            Football Club and Hibernian Football Club on plans to ground share 
            with the possibility of moving to a new stadium at Straiton, Edinburgh; 
            is aware of the historical association of both clubs with their respective 
            grounds in the west and east of the city and the communities that 
            surround them, and calls on both clubs and the City of Edinburgh Council 
            to initiate a full consultation with both sets of fans about their 
            views on the proposals.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-159#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Zoos, Conservation, 
            Education and Research</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the closure of Glasgow Zoo, scheduled for September 2003, 
            with the consequential requirement to re-house the animals and the 
            loss of a dedicated workforce; considers that the demise of Glasgow 
            Zoo raises issues about the role and funding of modern day zoos; further 
            notes that all zoos are now required to carry out a number of charitable 
            functions that require significant resourcing such as animal conservation, 
            education and scientific research, that zoos quite rightly also have 
            to maintain extremely high standards in animal welfare following strict 
            zoo licensing guidelines for the welfare and transaction of animals, 
            that they are regularly involved with organisations such as the Scottish 
            Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and HM Customs and 
            Excise in animal rescues and that they are labour intensive institutions 
            with high feeding, veterinary and infrastructure costs; is concerned 
            that, to fund the foregoing, a zoo in Scotland requires to be commercially 
            successful as it receives little or no central funding and that the 
            needs of animals and visitors are not always compatible, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should investigate central funding for 
            the conservation, research and education work carried out by zoos, 
            for example, at Edinburgh Zoo, where almost half of the animals are 
            in managed conservation and breeding programmes, some of which are 
            on the edge of extinction, such as the Amur tiger and the poison arrow 
            frog, where more than 25,000 schoolchildren per year are taught about 
            the interdependence of all living things and of our responsibility 
            for the biodiversity of the planet and where 40 under-graduate and 
            post-graduate students each year carry out non-invasive research on 
            all aspects of animal biology, nutrition and behaviour with direct 
            benefits to their kin, both in captivity and the wild. <strong><em>

            (MS) who need to seek medical supplies of cannabis to help alleviate

            at their disposal does not include medical cannabis supplies; calls 
            for greater financial resources to be allocated to help search for 
            treatments that alleviate the symptoms of MS; believes that these 
            treatments include the medical use of cannabis and further calls on 
            Her Majesty&#146;s Government to issue an immediate review of the

            University, could soon be seeking asylum in the United Kingdom if 
            they become subject to repression by the Iranian regime, and accords

            the initiative of the Labour Party in Wales in bringing this policy 
            onto the legislative agenda and recommends that Labour Party members 
            of the Parliament look at the Welsh Labour official press briefing 
            which answered the question of why free school meals should be provided 
            by stating &quot;to help tackle poverty and because the costs involved 
            in setting up a bureaucratic system to collect money, account for 
            it, follow payments up if not made, etc. would eat into the potential 
            revenue as to make it not worth collecting. By not confining the scheme 
            to those entitled to free school meals we avoid the problem of stigma
