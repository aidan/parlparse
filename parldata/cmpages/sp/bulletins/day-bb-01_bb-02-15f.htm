            importance of National Tartan Day, held annually in the United States 

            on 6 April, which celebrates the contribution of Scots and Scots-Americans 

            to the creation and prosperity of America and welcomes the opportunities

            Lochhead: Oil and Gas Report</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes the 

            <i>Economic Report 2000</i> published by the Offshore Operators Association; 

            notes that the report indicates increasing confidence in Scotland’s 

            oil and gas industry, and states that capital expenditure from 2001-04 

            is expected to be around £12 billion with £4 billion earmarked for 

            this year alone and that remaining reserves off Scotland’s shores 

            may be up to 30% more than the 28 billion barrels of oil already produced; 

            further notes that Her Majesty’s Treasury has already benefited from 

            £170 billion in taxes since the 1970s and that a further £7.3 billion 

            in tax is expected to be paid for 2001-02; encourages the Scottish 

            Executive to work closely with the industry, particularly the smaller 

            independent and often indigenous companies that are set to further 

            develop the Scottish sector, in order to ensure that the industry 

            continues to play a central role in the Scottish economy, and recognises 

            that, if Scotland were independent, this would open up further opportunities 

            to develop world leading offshore technology and related activity 

            as well as allowing growing oil and gas revenues to assist the Scottish 

            Parliament’s efforts to improve the quality of life for Scotland’s 

            people.</font></p>

            the murderers of the Scottish journalist Malcolm Rennie and his colleagues, 

            killed by the Indonesians on 16 October 1975 during the Indonesian 

            invasion of East Timor; commends the UN for the speed with which they 

            have taken action on this issue, and condemns successive UK and Australian 

            Governments for their failure to pursue this issue, placing commercial 

            and military contracts with the Indonesians above the investigation 

            of war crimes.</font></p>

            (SAC) will suffer absolute cuts in funding from the Scottish Executive 

            of some £1.5 million over the next three years; notes that these cuts 

            will fall on the education and research functions of the college, 

            taking out productive capacity and therefore limiting the SAC’s ability 

            to replace core funding cuts by income generation; recognises that 

            SAC has a key role to play in rural development particularly at a 

            time when the agriculture and fishing industries are in crisis, and 

            calls upon the Scottish Executive to review its perverse decision 

            on SAC funding which will hinder both rural development and lifelong 

            learning objectives in rural Scotland.</font></p>
