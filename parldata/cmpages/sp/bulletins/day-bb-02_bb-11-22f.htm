          <p><strong>*S1M-3624</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Anticoagulation 
            Medication Strips on Prescription</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that Scotland has a significant and growing number of patients who 
            require oral anticoagulation medication to avoid potentially fatal 
            bleeding or clotting; recognises that diagnostic technology enables 
            these patients to self-monitor their blood-clotting times in order 
            to determine the correct dose of anticoagulation medication, at considerable 
            saving to the NHS and convenience to the patient; notes that anticoagulation 
            monitoring strips are available on prescription in England, Wales 
            and Northern Ireland but not yet in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to make such strips available on prescription in Scotland 
            without further delay.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3623#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Glasgow to 
            Barra Air Link Public Service Obligation</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the decision to award a public service obligation 
            order to the Glasgow to Barra air link for one year only; recognises 
            that such orders are normally awarded for three years; further recognises 
            the concern felt in Barra that this constitutes a major threat to 
            the long-term future of the air service which, in turn, could engender 
            more social and economic decline in an area already affected by depopulation, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should reinstate the order 
            for three years.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3622</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: The Cairngorms National 
            Park Elections (Scotland) Order 2003</strong>-That the Rural Development 
            Committee, in consideration of the Cairngorms National Park Elections 
            (Scotland) Order 2003, recommends that the Order be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3621</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: The Cairngorms National 
            Park Designation, Transitional and Consequential Provisions Order 
            2003</strong>-That the Rural Development Committee, in consideration 
            of the Cairngorms National Park Designation, Transitional and Consequential 
            Provisions Order 2003, recommends that the Order be approved. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3620#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Council Tax on 
            Second Homes</strong>-That the Parliament considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should give local authorities the power to charge council 
            tax in full on second homes.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3619#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Security Measures 
            for Holyrood</strong>-That the Parliament considers that the Scottish 
            Parliamentary Corporate Body should abandon its attempt to make the 
            new Parliament building bomb-proof, which has already cost approximately 
            £28 million and threatens to result in much more cost and delay.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3618</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Gaelic Language 
            (Scotland) Bill - Stage I</strong>-That the Parliament agrees to the 
            general principles of the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3617</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson: Health Service 
            Journal Management Awards 2002 - Primary Care Category</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the Ayrshire and Arran Primary Care NHS 
            Trust and East Ayrshire Council on winning the Primary Care Category 
            of the Health Service Journal Management Awards 2002 for their innovative 
            partnership project at Dalmellington and looks forward to further 
            developments of this nature to improve the quality of life of citizens.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3616</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Delays in Security 
            Clearance for Parliamentary Staff</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">is 
            dissatisfied with the long delays frequently occurring in the process 
            of obtaining security clearance for new staff and the lack of accountability 
            of the government department involved in the process and urges the 
            Presiding Officer to take up the matter with the relevant authorities.</a></p>
