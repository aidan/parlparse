          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1484#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Closure and Rationalisation of Maternity Services</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its grave concern at the sustained attacks on maternity services; believes that rationalisation of maternity services with consultations held in isolation and without reference to cross-boundary and pan-Scotland impact continue unabated; notes that claimed benefits of centralisation in relation to morbidity and mortality are unproven; is concerned that the risks associated with reduced access to consultant-led services have not been assessed and no time has been allowed to assess the impact of previous closures before further closures are embarked upon; reiterates concern that there are no minimum standards for staffing establishments of midwives across the service and that models for calculating staff numbers and ratios are outdated and outmoded; notes that expectations of staff by the public and demands of government have increased dramatically over the years which has created more work for all staff providing maternity services despite a declining birth rate, and considers that the Scottish Executive should implement a moratorium on maternity closures and conduct a full, systemic analysis of the provision of maternity services across Scotland that involves the public and all trade union and professional organisations with the aim of establishing agreed minimum staffing establishments in a safe, co-ordinated service that meets the needs of all women and families across the whole of Scotland, maintains the expertise and excellence already established in the provision of these services and finds ways to deliver the right service for properly assessed need that has the confidence of communities, whatever measures are necessary to achieve these objectives.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1483#</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Real Cost of Road Transport</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the real cost of road transport includes the cost of climate change and significant health problems attributable to noise and air pollution and the ever-increasing costs of road maintenance;&nbsp;agrees, therefore, that fuel tax must be progressively increased subject to three conditions: firstly, that there must be overall tax reform that redistributes wealth downwards to prevent unfair impacts on people with low incomes, disabled people and people in remote communities, secondly, that there must be significant investment in public transport alternatives to the car and road freight so that people and businesses have more choice in mode of transport and,&nbsp;thirdly, that there must be incentives to encourage use of less polluting UK-grown biofuels, and believes that such moves would make Scotland more sustainable, safer and less polluted.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1482</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Rule 2.3.1</strong>-That the Parliament agrees the following dates under Rule 2.3.1: 12 - 20 February 2005 (inclusive), 25 March - 10 April 2005 (inclusive), 2 July - 4 September 2005 (inclusive).</P>
          <P>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1481#</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Raffan:</strong> <strong>Urgent Need to Tackle Hepatitis C, Public Health Crisis</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the UK Hepatitis C Resource Centre for Scotland; recognises the urgent need to raise awareness of what the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh described in their UK Hepatitis C Consensus Statement of April 2004 as a &quot;public health crisis&quot; which affects between 45,000 and 65,000 people in Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Executive should acknowledge that, as with HIV/AIDS, this epidemic can only be effectively tackled through central, ring-fenced funding for both treatment and prevention.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong>, Jeremy Purvis<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Mr Andrew Welsh<strong>*</strong>, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Mr John Home Robertson<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1480#</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Alcohol Support</strong>-That the Parliament commends the dedicated work of Albyn House, the Alcohol Advisory and Counselling Service and Bon Accord Befrienders in Aberdeen for providing help, advice and support to people with alcohol-related problems; recognises that alcohol abuse is a serious social problem that blights the lives of a steadily increasing number of people in Scotland; notes that these three organisations will be joining efforts to create Alcohol Support this summer; recognises the social, health and economic benefits that a secure stream of funding to alcohol support groups such as Alcohol Support would have for Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should commend the new service as an exemplar in its field.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1479</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland Local Report, June 2004, NHS Highland Schizophrenia Standards</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland's phase 2 peer review of Highland Primary Care NHS Trust's schizophrenia care standards; notes that, of 29 essential criteria, only three were fully met, and of seven desirable criteria, only one was fully met; further notes with particular concern the report's findings that the trust does not record the number of people who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or for whom one is being considered and that there is not a standard guideline for use consistently across the trust, detailing the procedure to be followed to ensure that an appropriate needs and risk assessment is undertaken at diagnosis and to document the initial plan of care; recognises that schizophrenia is a serious and common medical illness and that many people who have the illness will continue to experience symptoms of varying degrees for many years and will require help and support from a number of different services, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that NHS Highland Primary Care Trust will fulfil its duty of meeting all the care standards.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1478</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>-That the Parliament agrees the following revision to the programme of business for 16 June 2004-</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-1476</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Hate Crime Against Disabled People in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the report, <em>Hate Crime Against Disabled People in Scotland: A Survey Report,</em> produced by Capability Scotland in conjunction with the Disability Rights Commission; deplores the prevalence of hate crime across Scotland towards disabled people; further notes the figures showing 47% of respondents reporting being frightened or attacked because of their disability, that one in five suffered an attack once a week, with women and under 44-year-olds most vulnerable to frequent attacks and that 73% had suffered from verbal attacks; notes as a consequence that 47% avoid certain areas, 38% change their usual routines and 25% are forced to move home; calls on the Scottish Executive to work with the police to improve reporting procedures for disabled people, and further calls on the Executive to campaign to tackle the prejudices that exist in society against people with disabilities.</P>
