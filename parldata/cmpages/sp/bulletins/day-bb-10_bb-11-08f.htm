<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7360 Patricia Ferguson: St Charles&rsquo; Primary School 2nd Eco Flag</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the award of a second Green Flag to St Charles&rsquo; Primary School; congratulates the entire school community on its achievement but particularly the Eco Committee made up of pupils in primaries 2 to 7 who have led the school&rsquo;s efforts, and notes the opportunities that have been gained to encourage outdoor learning and global citizenship throughout the school and the work done to involve the local community in what is considered this important initiative.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7359 Liam McArthur: Ray Jones Receives Ed Rainy Brown Memorial Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Ray Jones, the chief executive of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, received the Ed Rainy Brown Memorial Award at the SAOS 2010 Annual Dinner; further notes that the award is presented annually to an individual in the farming, forestry, aquaculture or associated industries who is considered to have made an exceptional contribution in their specific field; believes that Ray Jones fully merits this recognition of his work, developing the Royal Highland Show so that, with record-breaking attendances, it remains one of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s top agricultural shows; congratulates Ray Jones on the award, and wishes him every success in his new post as chair of Scotland Food and Drink.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7358&diams;
  Jamie Hepburn: Nine Years of Conflict in Afghanistan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 7 October 2010 marked the ninth anniversary of the start of Operation Enduring Freedom by the United States&rsquo; military in Afghanistan and that 20 December 2010 will mark the ninth anniversary of the establishment of the International Security Assistance Force by the United Nations; further notes that this is longer than the duration of World War I and of World War II, and nearly as long as both these wars combined; regrets the loss of life caused by the conflict, including 341 military personnel from the United Kingdom, 2,174 from coalition forces in total and thousands of civilian causalities; considers that there is widespread concern among residents in Central Scotland and across the country at the ongoing loss of life, both military and civilian, in Afghanistan, and believes that greater progress is required to be made on a timely exit strategy.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7348 Jackie Baillie: Argyll and Bute School Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disappointed to note that Argyll and Bute Council is proposing to close four primary schools in the Helensburgh and Lomond area as part of a wider programme of closing 26 schools across the authority over the next year; considers that the resulting amalgamations will cause young children to have long commutes to school, will threaten teaching quality and teaching jobs and will have a negative impact on rural communities; further notes that one of the schools threatened is a special educational needs school; believes that proper account has not been taken of the future demand for education due to the planned increase of capacity at HMNB Clyde; further believes that the financial savings that would be generated by the school closures are outweighed by the cost to children&rsquo;s education and teacher employment and by the impact on these rural communities, and therefore urges Argyll and Bute Council to maintain all four schools, namely Luss Primary School, Kilcreggan Primary School, Rosneath Primary School and Parklands School.</p>
