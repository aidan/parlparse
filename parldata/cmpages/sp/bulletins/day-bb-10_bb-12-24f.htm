<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7663 Charlie Gordon: Proposed Reduction in Coastguard Stations in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament rejects the current proposal of the UK Government to reduce the number of coastguard stations in Scotland as a reckless measure that would put lives at risk.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7662 Cathy Peattie: International Rescue</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates International Rescue on its work throughout the world, saving lives in a wide variety of emergencies and disasters, including the assistance that it recently gave NHS Forth Valley in assisting medical personnel with transport and by clearing snow toenable visits to be made to snowbound patients&rsquo; homes.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>, Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong>, Cathy Jamieson<strong>*</strong>, Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Patricia Ferguson<strong>*</strong>, Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell<strong>*</strong>, Karen Whitefield<strong>*</strong>, Helen Eadie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7661 Stewart Stevenson: Red Van Man Beats White Van Man</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the Royal Mail staff who, despite unprecedented weather conditions across Scotland, continue to ensure delivery of Christmas cards and parcels; in particular recognises the commitment of individual postmen and women who are often completing deliveries on foot where their vans cannot go, in very low temperatures, through deep snow and in consequence are working very long hours, and contrasts this with the many alternative carriers that have given up.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Jamie Hepburn<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Bill Wilson<strong>*</strong>, Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Joe FitzPatrick<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7660 Tom McCabe on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body: Scottish Commission for Public Audit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body&rsquo;s proposal to appoint Stewart Stevenson MSP as a member of the Scottish Commission for Public Audit.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7659 Ken Macintosh: The Town and Country Planning (Tree Preservation Order and Trees in Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Regulations 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Communities Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Town and Country Planning (Tree Preservation Order and Trees in Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Regulations 2010.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7658 Murdo Fraser: Submarine Dismantling Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Ministry of Defence has named Rosyth Royal Dockyard as one of the two potential sites for the Submarine Dismantling Project, along with Devonport Royal Dockyard; notes that the project has been established to dismantle 27 defueled nuclear submarines after they have left service with the Royal Navy; believes that, should Rosyth be awarded the contract, it would bring a massive economic boost to Rosyth, Fife and Scotland; further believes that Rosyth is home to one of the most highly skilled workforces suited for this type of work and that there is a proud history and connection in Fife to the Royal Navy, and hopes that Rosyth is successful in winning the Submarine Dismantling Project.</p>
