<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3203</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Lifeline Tubes Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the successful completion of the Lifeline Tubes service pilot in Cumbernauld, as part of the Living Well in North Lanarkshire project; congratulates NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council on the introduction of this innovative voluntary scheme, designed for anyone who feels vulnerable when living alone; notes that plastic tubes<font color="#0000ff">,</font> containing vital details of any illness or allergy, medication taken and emergency contacts are distributed then stored in the individual&rsquo;s  refrigerator hence providing emergency services with potentially life-saving information in the event of the individual suffering a sudden illness or personal accident, and welcomes the extension of this service throughout North Lanarkshire.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3202</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the intention of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs to close its Peterhead office and to reduce the number of staff in its Aberdeen office; considers that the closure of the Peterhead office and the reduction of service in Aberdeen can only be of detriment to the public; further considers that this will lead to job losses at a time of economic difficulty and will do nothing to assist the local economy of the north east; also considers that Scotland is disproportionately affected by these closures, and calls on the UK Government to reconsider its approach immediately.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3201#</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Alderman Road Community Garden Highly Commended in the People Category of SURF Awards 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its congratulations to the Alderman Road Community Garden, which operates in the Knightswood area of Glasgow, for being highly commended in the People category of the 2008 Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum Awards; extols the work of the project in providing a purposeful working environment for those furthest from the job market, such as people suffering from mental health problems, people with drug or alcohol addiction, long-term unemployed people and asylum seekers, in a range of areas in horticulture, hard and soft landscaping, recycling and retail; recognises the outstanding enterprise of the lead organisation, the Coach House Trust, in the field of mental health and environmental and social justice, and celebrates the enhancement of wellbeing, pride and opportunity in the local community facilitated by the Alderman Road Community Garden and projects like it.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3196</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Hospital Parking Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing&rsquo;s claim to have abolished hospital parking charges, in particular the assertion that they have &quot;no place in a National Health Service&quot; and that &quot;abolishing charges eases the financial burden at a difficult time&quot;; believes that, despite this claim, some NHS boards are already hatching plans to introduce an alternative car parking charge such as that to be implemented at Glasgow&rsquo;s Southern General Hospital, where car park users are to be restricted to a four-hour stay and thereafter subject to a &pound;40 fine and potential criminal conviction, with what seems a distressing and cumbersome procedure being the only means of redress; further believes that such a scheme is incompatible with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s claim to have abolished hospital parking charges and is especially prejudicial to staff, and therefore calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to make clear to all NHS boards across Scotland that alternative plans to impose charges on those with legitimate reasons to be parked in publicly-owned NHS car parks must be abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3195</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Scottish Conservative and Unionist</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with incredulity that the Scottish Conservatives have dropped the term unionist from their title just as the UK party has resumed its use following its electoral agreement with the Ulster Unionists and urges Annabel Goldie to end the confusion by reaffirming that the unionist credentials of the Scottish Tories remain intact.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3168</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Ending the Civil War in Sri Lanka</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Sri Lankan army and government on the capture of Kilinochchi from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) earlier this year after heavy fighting; considers that the LTTE is a terrorist organisation that has carried out indiscriminate attacks on the Sinhalese community, Indian Tamils, Tamil Muslims and moderate Sri Lankan Tamils during the 25 years of its insurgency, a conflict that has cost over 70,000 lives; is aware that in attempting to eradicate the LTTE, which has used suicide bombings, assassinations and intimidation to further its aims, Sri Lankan forces have, regrettably, inflicted civilian casualties; acknowledges that terrorist organisations frequently hide and launch attacks from among vulnerable civilian populations, callously believing, often rightly, that when women and children are unintentionally killed by counter insurgents it will increase sympathy and support for the terrorist cause; urges the LTTE to accept that there is no violent solution to its grievances, and calls on both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Government to end the fighting and needless loss of life with the aim of negotiating a peaceful settlement, which will inevitably require a willingness to compromise on both sides.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3166</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>The Future of the Arts in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the letter circulated on 5 January 2008, with 440 signatories, expressing apprehension about the formation of Creative Scotland and the effects on artists&rsquo; welfare and practice, including the view that the situation regarding Creative Scotland has now reached crisis point; notes that the letter highlights a perceived lack of concern for artists&rsquo; needs and UNESCO declarations on culture and freedom, a lack of meaningful consultation with the arts communities during the transition process, an inadequacy of funding and an impact on artistic independence of proposals that include an exploitation of intellectual property rights and an introduction of loans coupled with a cut in grant aid; recognises that this is the latest in a series of criticisms of the Creative Scotland proposals and believes that this lack of confidence in&nbsp;the formation of Creative Scotland is shared by many others; considers that the proposals for Creative Scotland have failed to convince many people that they offer any significant improvement on the current provision of support for artists and the development of, and entitlement to, culture in Scotland and moreover that many consider that they will have a negative impact on our arts and culture, and believes that the Scottish Government should take on board these criticisms and not proceed further without reviewing its plans, consulting widely and seeking consensus on a positive and constructive way forward for the funding and development of arts and culture in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3158</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Last Train on the Waverley Line</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 40 years ago, on 5 January 1969, the 21.55 from Waverley station to St Pancras was the final journey of the last train on the Waverley line; also notes that its closure was not without a fight, with protesters blocking the line at Newcastleton causing the Night Midland sleeper to be several hours late; regrets that its closure left the Scottish Borders as the only region in mainland Britain without passenger railway stations; notes further that, in June 2000, the Scottish Parliament voted unanimously to restore the line and that the Scottish Government has already provided &pound;1 million to allow preparatory work to begin for construction, and, on this anniversary, reasserts its commitment to reinstatement of the line.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3157</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Cut Power Bills Now</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the forward price of gas for delivery in winter 2009 has plummeted from 109p per therm in July to 63.6p per therm in the last days of 2008, a decline of almost 42%; further notes that the forward price of electricity fell from &pound;94.50 per MWhour to &pound;56.65 over the same period, a decrease of over 40%; is concerned that power companies that were so keen to raise prices rapidly and in full during 2008 are much more reluctant to pass on full price cuts quickly, with consumers expected to wait until February or March for probable price cuts of only 5% or 10%, with 20% cuts at best; acknowledges that the wholesale cost of gas and electricity represents about two thirds of the total cost of supply borne by energy providers, and believes therefore that hard-pressed energy consumers, both domestic and business, should receive full price cuts and swiftly or that energy providers should be compelled by the UK Government to make the cuts.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2937</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Health Boards (Membership and Elections) (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Health Boards (Membership and Elections) (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2932#</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Future of the Bull Hire Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposals to abolish the current Bull Hire Scheme for crofters; is aware of genuinely felt concerns among crofters over this proposal and the potentially more costly and inconvenient options that might replace the scheme; believes that the current Bull Hire Scheme has widespread support within the crofting sector and has played an extremely important part in maintaining the quality of cattle stock in the crofting counties, and further believes that some form of bull hire scheme is in the best interests of crofters and stock quality in the crofting counties.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2790.1</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>GDP&rsquo;s Inadequacy as a Measure of Sustainable Economic Growth</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2790) in the name of Bill Wilson, leave out from first &quot;sustainable&quot; to &quot;growth and&quot; and insert &quot;environmentally-sustainable economic growth; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to a more successful country; further welcomes&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2753#</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the decision taken by Post Office Ltd to remain committed to its original post office branch closure programme across the South of Scotland despite the numerous strong objections made by individuals, businesses and community groups; further deplores the loss in particular of Greenlaw Post Office, which was shown to be a thriving and profitable business; notes with deep concern the detrimental impact that this loss of service provision in Greenlaw will have on the economy of the immediate local community and surrounding area, individuals and small to medium-sized businesses reliant upon a service that is very localised and customised to their specific needs and that provides face-to-face personal support and advice to elderly, disabled and vulnerable people, and considers that urgent action should be taken to retain effective and comprehensive postal services in Greenlaw and the rest of the South of Scotland.</p>
