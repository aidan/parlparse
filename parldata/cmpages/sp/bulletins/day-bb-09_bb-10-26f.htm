<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5050</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Give All Racism in Scottish Football the Boot</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the swift response from Show Racism the Red Card and Glasgow Rangers FC to the racial abuse allegedly suffered by Maurice Edu; notes with disappointment that the relevant incident took place during Show Racism the Red Card&rsquo;s annual Fortnight of Action during which all of Scotland&rsquo;s football clubs combine to deliver an anti-racist message; welcomes the demonstration of their support for the campaign through on-pitch activities in a weekend of action on 24 and 25 October 2009; agrees that racism of any kind is totally unacceptable; urges fans of all Scottish football clubs to challenge all examples of racism in football and society in general; believes that the singing of &quot;the Famine Song&quot; in particular has not been challenged vigorously enough, and calls on anti-racist organisations and football authorities to respond as strongly to any and all future incidents of racism in Scottish football and with the same level of condemnation and action as has been the case on this occasion.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5048</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Parliamentary Salaries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the salaries of MSPs, recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body to be 87.5% of those paid to MPs, may be raised as a consequence of an increase in MP salaries in recompense for the repayment of unreasonable expenses requested by Thomas Legg; believes that this is not an objective method of evaluating parliamentary salaries, which should lie with an independent salaries review body; resolves to refuse any consequential increase in MSP salaries, which it believes to be engineered in the interests of Westminster parties to avoid the embarrassment of MPs refusing to comply with Thomas Legg&rsquo;s requests, and further resolves to break the perceived link with Westminster salaries, to have its members&rsquo; salaries evaluated by the Senior Salaries Review Board, or similar independent body, and to accept such an independently-calculated salary consistent with the Parliament&rsquo;s high standards of transparency and probity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5047</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Pulteneytown Academy, 50 Years Young</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Pulteneytown Academy Primary School in Wick on reaching its 50th birthday; realises that this is a golden milestone for the school and the town; recognises the hard work of the pupils, staff, teachers and head teacher, and wishes them all the best for an equally successful second half century and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5046</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Bad Science at the UK Border Agency</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with dismay that, despite widespread condemnation by the scientific community, the UK Border Agency has announced that it will continue with its nationality-swapping Isotope analysis and DNA-testing process, or so-called Human Provenance Project, intended to establish the race and national origin of people seeking asylum in the United Kingdom and specifically to identify Somali nationals; notes that Sir Alec Jeffreys, the pioneer of DNA fingerprinting, has described the project as &quot;wildly premature, even ignoring the moral and ethical aspects&quot;; further notes that an editorial in <em>Nature</em> magazine describes the project as &quot;scientifically flawed, ethically dubious and potentially damaging to science&quot;; believes that, even if these test results are not used to determine the outcome of individual asylum claims, they are nonetheless invasive, of questionable purpose and open to potential abuse, and calls on the Home Office to cancel the Human Provenance Project forthwith.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5045</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Save the Wyndford Wall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the application on behalf of the Wyndford Residents Association in Maryhill to have the Wyndford Barracks wall listed by Historic Scotland; considers that Wyndford is an urban community of distinct identity and notes that the perimeter wall surrounds the Wyndford housing estate on the site of the former Wyndford Barracks, which opened in 1872 and was home to two proud Scottish regiments, the Royal Scots Greys and the Highland Light Infantry; considers the wall to be a local landmark that links the community to its past and believes that local historic structures should, where possible, be preserved; wishes the Wyndford Residents Association well in its efforts to improve the local environment for future generations, and notes the sense of civic pride that local people hold for the area and the outrage at proposals to demolish the barracks wall.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5044</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Mail Delivery Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision by Procurement Scotland, on behalf of the Scottish Government, to remove business from Royal Mail; believes that this decision will cause further difficulties for Royal Mail in trying to sustain a public delivery service in every part of Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to review this decision to ensure that all such decisions taken are compatible with support for public delivery services in every community in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5042&diams; </strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Fair Treatment for All Investors in Kaupthing, Singer and Friedlander</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that many charities lost large amounts of money when the UK-based subsidiary of the Icelandic bank under the auspices of Kaupthing, Singer and Friedlander was placed in administration by the UK Government in 2008; notes that the Highland Hospice, the only hospice serving adults with incurable life-limiting disease in the Highlands and acknowledged as the centre of specialist palliative care expertise in the region, was one of these depositors; considers that, due to the arbitrary Financial Services Compensation Scheme criteria, some wealthy individuals have been compensated for their loss in full and that, due to a direct intervention by the Prime Minister, the Christie Hospital in Manchester, a registered charity, was fully compensated, but notes that Highland Hospice has not been compensated for its loss, despite a Treasury Committee recommendation for charities to be recompensed, and understands that this is because the UK Government has stated that this would affect the general help provided to the third sector by the Resilience Fund launched earlier this month by the Scottish Government; understands however that Highland Hospice does not meet the criteria of the Resilience Fund, and would therefore welcome both a review of the Resilience Fund&rsquo;s criteria and that the Scottish Government make representations to the UK Government to fairly recompense all charities and enable Highland Hospice to continue to provide invaluable palliative and end-of-life care throughout the Highlands of Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5041</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Charity Ball Raises &pound;3,392 for Parkinson&rsquo;s Research</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Jane Bee, of Carronshore, Falkirk, on organising a hugely successful ball to mark the 40th anniversary of the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society; notes that the ball, held in the Best Western Park Hotel, Falkirk, on 17 October 2009, raised over &pound;3,392 for Parkinson&rsquo;s research and that it was attended by the UK Chief Executive of the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society, and wishes the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society and its fundraisers and supporters every continuing success in their important work to support those affected by the disease and improve understanding of its causes and possible treatments.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5040</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Science and the Parliament 2009, the Science behind Health</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 2009 Science and the Parliament event taking place on 11 November 2009, which will focus on the science behind health; notes the continued commitment of the Royal Society of Chemistry in organising this event that brings together the scientific community in Scotland with policy makers; considers that science can make a major contribution to better health outcomes and the economy through innovation, and congratulates the scientists in Scotland working in the field of health for their many areas of internationally renowned research.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5039</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Grampian Police on Scottish Policing Awards Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Grampian Police on winning nine prizes at the inaugural Scottish Policing Awards held at the Scottish Police College on 20 October 2009; notes that the awards are designed to recognise the work done by police forces across the country and to celebrate exceptional initiatives run by officers and staff; congratulates the force on its success in receiving an outstanding contribution award for the pioneering development of a missing persons profiling toolkit; congratulates the force also on winning five highly commended awards for a number of other high profile initiatives, including cracking down on street-level drug dealers, targeting young antisocial driving and a racism and homophobia awareness-raising project for young people; believes that the force&rsquo;s success at the Scottish Policing Awards reflects its commitment to delivering an outstanding service to the communities of north-east Scotland; believes that the nine awards are testament to the excellent standard of innovation, determination and professionalism demonstrated by Grampian Police staff, all of whom are helping to make a tangible difference to policing in the north east, and pays tribute to the hard work of all involved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5038</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>RNID Report, Who Benefits?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the findings in the report by RNID, <em>Who Benefits?, </em>which show that people who are deaf are missing out on Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and Attendance Allowance because their benefits claims are being rejected unfairly; notes that, while previous research conducted by RNID in 2001 showed that many deaf people were not claiming DLA because they had had their claims turned down, this situation has not improved in the last seven years and, in certain cases, it has worsened; further notes that over half of those questioned who successfully claimed DLA had had a claim turned down previously, yet 91% of appeals by British Sign Language (BSL) users are successful; is dismayed that 74% of respondents said that they found the 54-page DLA form difficult to complete, with 56% of BSL users saying that they could not understand some of the questions and 66% reporting that most of the questions on the form were not relevant to deafness, and that, when examinations were conducted in the claimant&rsquo;s home by a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) health professional, 28% said that they had difficulty communicating with the doctor; believes that more work needs to be done to ensure that the 758,000 people in Scotland who are deaf or hard of hearing are no longer denied access to benefit entitlements, and calls for the guidance used by DWP decision-makers regarding the specific needs of deaf people to be strengthened and met.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5037</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>End Discrimination in Transmission Access Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the intervention of the European Commission over the UK Government&rsquo;s iniquitous transmission charges that are considered to discriminate against producers of renewable energy in remote areas; notes that recent figures estimate that under these charges renewable energy producers in Shetland and Orkney pay over &pound;21 per kilowatt hour to use the system while in some areas of the south of England a similar venture would receive a subsidy of around &pound;7/kW, and considers that these charges are unfair and represent a risk to a viable renewable energy future for Scotland, especially the Highlands and Islands, which in turn jeopardises potential jobs as well as economic and scientific advancement.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5036</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Skillbuild 2009, Congratulations to South Lanarkshire College, East Kilbride</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that South Lanarkshire College successfully hosted the Skillbuild 2009 Competition; offers congratulations to all Scottish winners in their construction categories, including Douglas Robertson and Steven Butler, both students of South Lanarkshire College, who won the bronze medal for carpentry and the silver medal for roof slating and tiling respectively; notes the ongoing success of South Lanarkshire College, and congratulates all those involved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5035</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Plugged in Safely?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of a campaign by the Electrical Safety Council, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s only charity dedicated to electrical safety, to increase awareness of the dangers of purchasing unsafe goods via the internet and, in particular, welcomes the charity&rsquo;s independent safety testing that has established that 100% of chargers bought from a range of online auction sites and retailers would not pass current UK safety standards and could cause a real danger to Scottish consumers if simply plugged in as intended.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5034</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Lloyds TSB Foundation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland to suspend its grant-making activities for the foreseeable future due to the loss of approximately &pound;6 million of income arising from the lack of pre-tax profits by the Lloyds Banking Group; considers that the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland, Scotland&rsquo;s largest independent foundation, has been an enormously important and innovative funding stream for the voluntary sector and that this disappointing decision has serious implications for the charitable economy in Scotland, particularly during the economic downturn; is deeply concerned that charities that depend on Lloyds&rsquo; funding, especially smaller organisations, may have to curtail or even cease operations as a result of this move; further notes the foundation&rsquo;s fears that proposals to amend the terms of its covenant would curtail its independent status, and calls on the Lloyds Banking Group to resolve the position urgently to enable the foundation to continue its work supporting Scottish charities until the Lloyds Banking Group returns to profit.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5033</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>The Bravery of Corporal Scott Cox of the Royal Highland Fusiliers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Royal Highland Fusilier Corporal Scott Cox from Inverclyde who saved the lives of 16 US marines when their Armadillo jeep was disabled by Taliban rockets in Afghanistan by securing, under intense fire and at great personal risk, a tow rope to their vehicle and pulling it to safety; believes that his actions epitomise the bravery of many young men and women serving their country in Afghanistan and Iraq, in both of which Corporal Cox has served, and that, regardless of the rights and wrongs of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s involvement in these countries, the courage and sacrifice of members of the armed forces should never be forgotten and that the risks that they face make it imperative for the UK Government to have, as a minimum, a coherent and workable strategy with clear objectives shaped with great regard for the value of all human lives and that such risks should never be incurred due to inadequate equipment.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5032</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Charities Banking on Lloyds</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Lloyds Banking Group to provide the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland with a funding package that will enable it to continue its valuable grant-making activities in Scotland; notes that, since the establishment of the foundation in 1985, a covenant has dictated that this organisation, alongside three other autonomous foundations that cover the rest of the United Kingdom, receives a share of 1% of the Lloyds Banking Group&rsquo;s pre-tax profits per annum; understands that the Lloyds Banking Group has stated that it will have no profit this year and, as such, will not be providing revenue to the foundations, although the group has offered reduced interim funding subject to changes in the structure of the foundations; supports the proposal from the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland that it receive an advance of funding, repayable over an agreed timeframe, as this will ensure that the covenant remains intact and the foundation continues to operate as a wholly independent organisation; congratulates the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland for dispensing almost &pound;85 million to charities across Scotland since 1985, and calls on the Lloyds Banking Group to reconsider its position.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4641#</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Celebrating the Scottish-Polish Connection</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commemorates the 70th anniversary of the arrival of the Polish navy in Leith on 1 September 1939; notes that the three Polish destroyers Burza (Storm), Grom (Thunder) and Blyskawica (Lightning) saw service alongside the Royal Navy during the Second World War, with Grom being sunk with heavy loss of life on 4 May 1940; recognises that the arrival of the destroyers marked the beginning of a strong wartime Scottish-Polish connection, with several squadrons of the Polish Air Force serving in the country and Polish ships based at a number of Scottish ports, including Rosyth, Greenock, Port Glasgow, Ardrossan, Gourock, Dundee and Scapa Flow; further recognises that the main influx of Poles during the war occurred following the collapse of France in 1940 when some 30,000 Polish troops were evacuated to the United Kingdom and were stationed in Scotland, many of whom settled here; notes that a Polish house was organised in Edinburgh by the British Council to help the Polish community socially and educationally at this time; celebrates not just the wartime links but the long historical connection between Scotland and Poland, which includes upwards of 40,000 Scots migrating to Poland during the 17th century, and applauds the work of many organisations, including the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, for helping to develop awareness of the historical connections, promote cultural understanding and foster strong relations between modern generations of Scots and Poles.</p>
