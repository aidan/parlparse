Year of Mountains</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 2002 was the International 
Year of Mountains; further notes the high ecological value and great socio-economic 
importance of mountains for Scotland; welcomes the figure that 90% of visitors 
associate "beautiful scenery" with Scotland prior to their visit; notes the estimate 
that visits to the countryside for walking are worth £438 million to the Scottish 
economy; further notes the essential health benefits associated with walking anywhere, 
particularly in the hills, and calls on the Scottish Executive to continue to 
protect and promote Scotland's mountains as essential natural heritage, a source 
of wealth for the economy and a destination with significant health benefits for 
visitors.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3774#</STRONG> <STRONG>Robert Brown: Lead Pipes in 
Drinking Water Supplies</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the continued 
presence of lead pipes in both parts of the Scottish Water infrastructure and 
many domestic and business water supplies; notes the serious health hazards associated 
with lead in drinking water; notes the implications for the treatment of water 
supplies by Scottish Water and the unreliable nature of information as to the 
location of such lead pipes, and considers that an urgent review of the issue 
is needed and that action should be taken to ensure the removal of all lead pipes 
from drinking water supplies in Scotland as soon as possible and, specifically, 
to tackle the removal of lead pipes in Glasgow&#146;s older tenement areas.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3773</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Pauline McNeill: Drug Rape</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
Strathclyde Police on responding to increasing public concern over date rape drugs 
and taking the matter seriously and welcomes the force's "Drug Rape - Watch What 
you Drink" campaign over the festive season, which calls on the public to take 
extra care, particularly in relation to alcohol which is involved in over 50% 
of date rape drugging cases.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3766# British Cattle Movement Service</STRONG>

the current international situation and the public concerns that exist and therefore 
agrees to support UN Security Resolution 1441 as unanimously adopted by the UN 
Security Council; agrees that the Government of Iraq must fully comply with all 
the provisions of the resolution; agrees that, if it fails to do so, the UN Security 
Council should meet in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance; 
believes that any decision that Iraq is in &quot;material breach&quot; of resolution 
1441 is for the UN Security Council as a whole to determine and that no military 
action to enforce Resolution 1441 should be taken against Iraq without a mandate 
from the UN Security Council, and further believes that no British forces should 
be committed to any military action against Iraq without a debate in the House 
of Commons and a substantive motion in favour.&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Nora
