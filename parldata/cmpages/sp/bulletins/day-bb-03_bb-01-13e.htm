            offices, the number of cases involving an accused aged under the age

            paragraph 139 of the Audit Scotland report, <em>Dealing with offending 
            by young people</em>, that &quot;a serious problem is the lack of throughcare 
            and aftercare&quot; and &quot;prisoners serving less than four years 
            are not subject to statutory aftercare and may receive no support 
            after leaving prison.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-33092</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to the statement in

            by young people</em>, that &quot;there is no national information about 
            the number of children in residential schools.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-33093</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what data it has on the number of young 
            people in residential and secure units and young offenders institutions 
            that have mental health difficulties and on the staffing provision 
            in such units and institutions, as referred to in paragraph 166 of 
            the Audit Scotland report, <em>Dealing with offending by young people</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-33094</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive in the light of the statement in paragraph 
            190 of the Audit Scotland report, <em>Dealing with offending by young 
            people</em>, that &quot;information about the progress of young people 
            under supervision of local authorities is limited&quot;, what data 
            it has and what action it has taken, or plans to take, to improve 
            the collection and collation of such data.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-33095</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to the statement in 
            paragraph 203 of the Audit Scotland report, <em>Dealing with offending 
            by young people</em>, that "local authorities complain that there are 
            too many separate funding sources, that they appear uncoordinated

          <p><strong>S1W-33096</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to the statement in 
            paragraph 204 of the Audit Scotland report, <em>Dealing with offending 
            by young people</em>, that, because the costs of custody in young offenders 
            institutions are met by the Scottish Prison Service and the local 
            authority meets the costs of secure accommodation which is five times 
            more expensive, &quot;this means that financial incentives and the 
            objective of minimising costs could conflict with the objective of 
            achieving the best results for young people who have offended&quot; 
            and whether it will accept the recommendation in the joint report 
            by the Justice 1 and 2 Committees, <em>Report on the Budget 2003-04</em>, 
            that funding for secure accommodation should come from the justice

            ask the Scottish Executive when it will publish its new national youth 
            justice standards, as referred to by the Minister for Education and 
            Young People on 5 December 2002 in its press release SEED153/2002.</p>
