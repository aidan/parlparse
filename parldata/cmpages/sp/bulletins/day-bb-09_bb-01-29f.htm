<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3331</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Protecting the Independence of the Mental Welfare Commission</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with particular concern the proposal by the Scottish Government to merge the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland with NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and some of the functions of the Care Commission; recognises that the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland is an organisation that is focused on the rights of individuals within the context of mental health legislation while NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is a broader body seeking to raise standards within the NHS in Scotland; agrees that the strength of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland is in its ability to monitor, visit and assist people with mental health problems independent of government and the NHS and that, as such, the findings contained within its reports are highly valued by experts in the field; acknowledges that the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland is not solely concerned with matters pertaining to health and can become involved in issues relating to care in prison, welfare benefits and how the criminal justice system deals with victims with mental disorders, and therefore believes that it is crucial for the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland to be wholly independent and continue to operate with a full remit.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3330</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2009 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3329</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>The Draft Budget (Scotland) Acts 2007 and 2008 Amendment Order 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Finance Committee recommends that the&nbsp;draft Budget (Scotland) Acts 2007 and 2008 Amendment Order 2009 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3328</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Hospital Car Parking Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that proposals by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to limit free car parking to four hours could result in financial penalties being imposed on staff and the public; notes that alternative facilities are often not available; believes that staff having to leave work to move cars after four hours will be disruptive to both staff and patients; also notes that members of the public can require to attend hospital for more that four hours; further believes that these proposals are not consistent with the pledge made by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, and calls for clarification of policy by the cabinet secretary and a commitment by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to revise its policy to avoid financial penalties being imposed on staff or those requiring to attend hospital for longer than four hours.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3327</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Record Growth in Scottish Scouting</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Council of the Scout Association on securing the biggest increase in scout membership for 20 years, particularly in the 14-17 Explorer scout section and in female membership; welcomes the establishment of the 8th Blackford Salaam group as the first Muslim scout group in Scotland; notes the new regional support structure recently launched and applauds the focus on developing scouting in localities where the organisation has been underrepresented, and urges the Scottish Government to support scouting in all relevant ways, including encouraging public and private organisations alike to allow time off work for scout leaders where necessary, and supporting continued investment in the facilities and programmes offered by the national activity centres.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3326</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>National Holocaust Memorial Day, 27 January 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continued relevance of Holocaust Memorial Day, the international day of remembrance for the victims of the Holocaust and of other genocides; further notes that Renfrewshire Council, chosen to host the Scottish National Holocaust Memorial Day, marked the day with, among other things, a series of events under the positive title, One Great Tapestry; A Celebration of Diversity, at which a major theme was &quot;stand up to hatred&quot;; believes that an appreciation of peoples and cultures the world over should be an integral part of the Scottish identity, as suggested by this title, and expresses the hope that Scotland will continue to welcome those fleeing persecution, stand up to hatred and have the courage to condemn all those who infringe human rights.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3325.1</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> <strong>Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3325) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out from &quot;widespread&quot; to end and insert &quot;the consultation on climate change and forestry that has just closed; welcomes the widespread agreement that there must be a significant planting increase to assist the process of combating climate change; is grateful to all those who brought a variety of ideas and views forward, and looks forward to a report to the Parliament on the outcome of the consultation.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3325.2</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3325) in the name of Sarah Boyack, after &quot;future&quot; insert &quot;; recognises with concern that the loss of potentially 100,000 hectares of estate earmarked for this lease option represents 35 to 40% of Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s (FCS) timber income and 25% of its land mass; notes that diminishing FCS income by such a significant proportion could lead to the loss of investment for new leisure and tourism facilities, other woodland initiatives and research and development on renewable energy and could, in the longer term, threaten existing facilities and projects due to a restricted maintenance budget; further notes the potential detrimental impact that giving away full cutting rights could have on sawmills, smaller timber contractors and timber companies that often rely on cutting contracts granted to them by FCS to sustain their businesses; believes that the lease option has been drawn up without considering the impact on rural and remote communities and without considering other land uses and land-use policies in an integrated approach;&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3324.1</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Gaelic Language Plan</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3324) in the name of Linda Fabiani, insert at end &quot;; further welcomes the boost to the language provided by the establishment of BBC Alba, and calls for continued investment in and expansion of Gaelic-medium education.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3322.2</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Transport Priorities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3322) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &quot;lacks&quot; to end and insert &quot;(STPR) focuses on the three STPR priorities of addressing safety on the network, maximising use of the network and making focused investments that deliver national benefits and notes that the STPR is not the only mechanism for the delivery of surface transport infrastructure supported by the Scottish Government which also involves working with regional transport partnerships and councils and that the Scottish Government is engaging with local communities such as Elgin, Inverness and Maybole to deliver solutions to a range of transport infrastructure issues that have important local benefits.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3322.3</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Transport Priorities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3322) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;and, while recognising that the new Forth Replacement Crossing is an overriding priority for Scotland, calls on the Scottish Government to state its priorities by reference to the projects listed in the Strategic Transport Projects Review and others identified by regional transport partnerships and local authorities as having a major regional significance.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3284*#*</strong> <strong>Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Investment in Schools in North Highland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the impact of the quality of a school&rsquo;s environment on the effectiveness of the education of its pupils and believes that the dilapidated state of a number of school buildings in the north Highlands impedes the education of many pupils; recognises Highland Council&rsquo;s lack of financial resources to renovate and build schools, and regrets the lack of a funding mechanism that would allow Highland Council to initiate a much-needed schools refurbishment and new-build programme.</p>
