          <p><strong>*S1M-2961</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Scotland United</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the tenth anniversary of the founding of Scotland 
            United which falls on 11 April 2002; recalls the despair in Scotland 
            at a fourth Tory election victory in England which deepened the democratic 
            deficit; commends those who were prepared to work across parties to 
            demand an opportunity for Scotland to choose its own constitutional 
            future; recognises that such work injected a new urgency into mobilising 
            a mass campaign for change which assisted in the process of establishing 
            this Parliament, and expresses the hope that the principle of co-operation 
            between politicians and the citizens of Scotland will assist in the 
            process of developing this Parliament and creating an effective institution 
            capable of winning Scotland&#146;s respect.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2959</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: "Other Side of 
            Scotland" Tourism Campaign</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
            the &quot;Other Side of Scotland&quot; campaign developed by the area 
            tourist boards in Aberdeen and Grampian, Angus and Dundee and the 
            Kingdom of Fife; recognises the importance of the communities along 
            Scotland&#146;s spectacular east coast and the need to encourage more 
            tourists to visit this area, and commends the partnership approach 
            taken by the area tourist boards involved in the campaign in an effort 
            to achieve this.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2958</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Fire Safety at the 
            Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy</strong>&#151;That the Parliament, in 
            light of the recent decision by the Fife NHS Board to centralise acute 
            services in the Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy, and fears expressed 
            by members of the public in relation to fire safety at the hospital, 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to instigate an investigation by 
            the Health and Safety Authority and the Fife Fire Service of the fire 
            safety precautions and other risks at the Victoria Hospital to ensure 
            that, in the event of any outbreak of fire, there is no risk to patients, 
            visitors and staff, and further calls for any report from such an 
            investigation be made public through the Parliament.</p>

            Council and Renfrewshire Council Boundaries (Braehead) Amendment Order 
            2002</strong>&#151;That the Local Government Committee recommends 
            that nothing further be done under the Glasgow City Council and Renfrewshire 
            Council Boundaries (Braehead) Amendment Order 2002 (SSI 2002/156).</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2956#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Dystonia</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates the Dystonia Society for its efforts 
            in raising awareness of this little-known but severely debilitating 
            neurological disorder which can cause involuntary sustained and painful 
            muscle spasms in various parts of the body; is concerned that, according 
            to the Dystonia Society, there are at least 38,000 sufferers in the 
            UK who sometimes have to wait years for a correct diagnosis due to 
            a lack of awareness on the part of General Practitioners (GPs); is 
            further concerned about the lack of appropriate genetic testing and 
            neurosurgical treatment options in Scotland; calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to ensure that adequate information is given to GPs so that 
            a correct and timeous diagnosis can be made and to provide resources 
            for research into the causes of Dystonia, and calls for the provision 
            of specialist nurses, physiotherapists, counsellors and a regional 
            co-ordinator for Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2955</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Deportation of 
            Eduardo Sanchez</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with grave 
            concern that Julio Eduardo Hoyos Sanchez, a 36-year-old Peruvian freelance 
            artist, is being held in Dungavel detention centre after having been 
            detained on the morning of Monday 25 March 2002 and that an order 
            for his deportation was granted on 19 March; notes that Eduardo Sanchez 
            has lived in Scotland for 11 years and has a 9-year-old son, Yan Shearer, 
            who lives with his mother, Carol Shearer (Eduardo&#146;s former partner) 
            in Orkney; further notes that Yan is seeking action on behalf of his 
            own human rights to stop his father being deported, that the entire 
            Shearer family is opposed to the deportation of Eduardo and that he 
            himself has lodged an appeal against this deportation order, and urges 
            the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice to make immediate 
            representations to the Home Office on behalf of Eduardo with a view 
            to it revoking the deportation order and allowing him to remain in 
            Scotland with his son.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2953#</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Timber Industry</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament acknowledges the value of timber as a primary product 
            within rural Scotland and the 11,000 jobs which are dependent on that 
            industry; recognises the very real difficulties faced by some rural 
            local authorities in maintaining and improving minor roads for timber 
            extraction, and believes that the Scottish Executive should meet COSLA&#146;s 
            Rural Affairs Committee and representatives of the forestry industry 
            to determine a satisfactory way forward, recognising that the placing 
            of weight restriction orders, which effectively landlock large areas 
            of mature timber, is not a realistic solution.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2952</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Criminal Justice 
            (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees to the general 
            principles of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dr Richard Simpson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2951</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Eigg's Ferry 
            Terminal and Pier</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            that the cost of the ferry terminal and pier at Kildonnan in Eigg, 
            approved by the First Minister, will be £260,000 of public money for 
            each of the 30 residents&#146; cars on Eigg; further notes that only 
            the cars of Eigg residents may use the car ferry due to the traffic 
            order that prevents non-residents taking cars to Eigg, and believes 
            that mainland taxpayers, who have contributed so generously to the 
            ferry terminal and pier, should be granted the use of it and that 
            the traffic order which prevents them driving their own vehicles in 
            Eigg should be withdrawn.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2950#</strong> <strong>Fiona McLeod: UN Children's Summit 
            8 - 10 May 2002</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the United 
            Nation&#146;s Special Session on Children 2002 which will take place 
            in New York on 8 - 10 May 2002; commends the recognition accorded 
            by the summit to the need for adults to listen to the views of young 
            people; considers that the Scottish Executive should regularly monitor 
            and report on the implementation of commitments by Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government that arise from the Special Session and relate to Scotland&#146;s 
            children; congratulates Save the Children for organising its &quot;world 
            fit for children&quot; event in Edinburgh to coincide with this summit, 
            and believes that a &quot;Children and Young People&#146;s Summit&quot; 
            should be held annually by the Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2944#</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon: Register of Pensioners' 
            Groups</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the work undertaken 
            by pensioners to create local elderly forums as a means of increasing 
            their democratic participation; recognises that this is inhibited 
            by the inadequate and sparse detail currently held on pensioners&#146; 
            groups in Scotland, and encourages the Scottish Executive to give 
            further consideration to the establishment of a standard local authority 
            register of pensioner groups in order to facilitate a crucial basis 
            of communication with such groups and promote empowerment through 
            easy access to information, which will allow pensioners&#146; issues 
            to be pursued on a much broader basis.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2943</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Welcome to Professor 
            Karen Vousden at the Beatson Institute</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the announcement by Cancer Research UK on 15 March 2002 of 
            a £10 million grant for the Beatson Institute in Glasgow; notes that 
            this support will enable the west of Scotland cancer centre to become 
            a world centre for cancer research; further notes that this commitment 
            to the Beatson Institute is particularly welcome as a clear indication 
            of confidence in the institute, and calls on MSPs of all parties to 
            welcome Professor Karen Vousden as the new director of the Beatson 
            Institute and wish her every success in advancing gene therapy to 
            the benefit of cancer patients throughout Scotland and the world.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2942</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: World's Biggest 
            Burns Supper</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the Lord 
            Provost of Glasgow for successfully hosting the world&#146;s biggest 
            Burns Supper on Friday 25 January 2002 and raising £34,500 to be donated 
            to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, Marie Curie Cancer

          <p> <strong>S1M-2939</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: Inverness 
            and the Highlands' Bid to be the European Capital of Culture 2008</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament wholeheartedly endorses Inverness and the Highlands&#146; 
            bid to become the European Capital of Culture 2008 as Scotland&#146;s 
            only contender for the event; recognises the significant economic 
            benefits that a successful bid could bring to the city, the rest of 
            the Highlands and Scotland as a whole, including its potential to 
            create a major increase in tourist spending and new temporary and 
            permanent jobs; notes Inverness&#146;s recently awarded city status; 
            urges organisations and individuals throughout the Highlands to submit 
            ideas and suggestions to Invernesshighland2008 to support and strengthen 
            the bid; welcomes the £100,000 contributions each from the Scottish 
            Executive, Highlands and Island Enterprise and Highland Council to 
            the campaign, and urges the Scottish Executive to continue its active

          <p> <strong>S1M-2938</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Naval Defence 
            Review and Faslane and Coulport Naval Dockyards</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with regret the announcement by Geoff Hoon MP, 
            Secretary of State for Defence, of the outcome of the naval defence 
            review and his failure to give adequate consideration to representations 
            from trade unions and elected parliamentarians; recognises that the 
            trade unions, whose agreement to changes in conditions at the Faslane 
            and Coulport naval dockyards in previous years has been hailed as 
            a model in industrial relations, proposed further in-house efficiencies 
            and proposed "through life" maintenance plans which would team the 
            repair yards with the companies that build Royal Navy ships in long 
            term maintenance deals but would appear now to have been rejected; 
            further notes that in addition to the privatisation of cleaning, catering 
            and maintenance staff, there will be the possibility of redundancies 
            across the UK with a significant proportion of these anticipated at 
            the Faslane and Coulport dockyards; further recognises that this level 
            of job loss will have a critical effect on the local economy as well 
            as a significant negative impact on the individual employees and their 
            families, the majority of which reside in the Dumbarton parliamentary 
            constituency where employment at the dockyards accounts for approximately 
            one quarter of the full-time employment in the area; is concerned 
            that the area already has one of the highest levels of unemployment 
            in Scotland and that the scale of the job loss will be devastating, 
            and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to take action to mitigate 
            these job losses by providing significant additional financial support 
            for the re-training and re-skilling of those affected, to work closely 
            with the Ministry of Defence to maximise redeployment and to establish 
            a job creation programme for the area and to consider extending the 
            Clyde Corridor initiative to include all areas from Bowling, through 
            Dumbarton and up to Garelochhead in order to assist in the economic 
            regeneration of the area.</p>

            Detention Centre, including references made to a lack of privacy and 
            freedom of movement, effectively creating a prison environment for

            further notes with concern the reported suicide attempt at Dungavel 
            of the Nigerian asylum seeker, Mr Dotun Adeosun, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to liase with the Home Office and to encourage 
            Her Majesty&#146;s Government to accede to requests by human rights 
            groups, such as the Friends of Refugees in Ayrshire, to have wider 
            access to visit and meet asylum seekers at the centre and to provide
