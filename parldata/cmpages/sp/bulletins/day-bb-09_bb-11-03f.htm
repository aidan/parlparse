<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5110</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s National Parks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the contribution that Scotland&rsquo;s two national parks make to sustainable social and economic development and to delivering the Greener Scotland agenda; notes the outcome of the National Parks Strategic Review, and welcomes the proposal to set up a National Parks Strategy group to guide future strategy for Scotland&rsquo;s national parks.</p>
<p>Supported by: Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-5109&diams; </strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Detention of Children at Dungavel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern over figures obtained from the UK Border Agency that show that, between October 2008 and September 2009, 103 children were detained at Dungavel in Scotland; notes that, in the last five years, 889 children from 488 families throughout the United Kingdom have been held for over 28 days, thus requiring UK ministers to personally approve continued detention; considers that these figures show that, despite the welcome commitment and efforts of the previous administration and the current Scottish Government to end the practice of the detention of children at Dungavel, children and families from Glasgow and throughout Scotland are still being subjected to this unacceptable practice, and would welcome further efforts from all political parties in Scotland to ensure that this practice is ended.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5108</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>It&rsquo;s Fun to Save</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the work of members of the Association of Mutual Insurers in developing a UK-wide initiative entitled Fun to Save that encourages four to seven-year-old children to become more financially capable; celebrates the recent launch of the Fun to Save website: <a href="http://www.funtosave.org/Default.aspx" target="_blank">www.funtosave.org</a>, which is the first UK-wide free resource designed to help children learn about the importance of savings and develop healthy attitudes towards money in everyday life; recognises that this is the only website that takes a holistic approach to savings by utilising learning games, by supporting activities for parents and by supporting lesson plans for teachers; notes the involvement of HM Treasury, the UK Government&rsquo;s Department for Children, Families and Schools, the Financial Services Authority and the Personal Financial Education Group in the development of this initiative, and encourages parents and teachers to engage with the Fun to Save website, where learning about the core principles of money and the benefits of saving is both accessible and fun.</p>
<p>Supported by: Claire Baker<strong>*</strong>, Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-5107</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Assurances Sought over Future of RBS Insurance Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that plans for a sell-off of the Royal Bank of Scotland&rsquo;s (RBS) insurance division as part of a wider process of restructuring at the bank may have a direct impact on jobs in the sector in Scotland and particularly in Glasgow, where around 1,600 jobs are based; welcomes ongoing discussions to ensure that both jobs and headquarter functions are maintained in Scotland, and seeks assurances from those involved in the proposed sell-off of the RBS insurance division that any final decision will, as a priority, protect the future of the workforce.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5106</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Teampull na Trionaid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes efforts by the Teampull na Trionaid Conservation Association to preserve Teampull na Trionaid at Carinish on North Uist; notes that this scheduled ancient monument, which is thought to date originally from 1203, is one of the Western Isles&rsquo; most iconic medieval churches and was a seminary and a centre of pilgrimage before falling into disuse by the 1600s; congratulates island residents on their determination to stop further deterioration of the building and to preserve as much as possible of this site, which is integral to island history, and wishes the islanders success in raising the necessary funds to enable rescue work on Teampull na Trionaid to start as soon as possible.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5105</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Caledonian University Leading the Way on Widening Access to Higher Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that access to a university education should be widened to ensure that people from all communities, including those from the most deprived backgrounds, can benefit and should be based on talent and ability and not on social background or ability to pay; notes that this is particularly important in Glasgow, given the recent University and College Union report that placed three Glasgow constituencies, Glasgow north east, south west and east in the poorest performing 7% of constituencies in the United Kingdom, based on adults having a university degree; notes that the matter is compounded by the lack of any qualifications at all by many adults in these areas, most notably in Glasgow east, which ranks 623 out of 629 in terms of qualifications; in this context congratulates Glasgow Caledonian University on being the only Scottish university to receive both the UK Award for Lifelong Learning and the award for Widening Participation Initiative of the Year; acknowledges that this is the second year that Glasgow Caledonian University has been recognised for its excellence in education after receiving the 2008 Award for Outstanding Support for Overseas Students; recognises the great contribution to Glasgow&rsquo;s communities that the university and its Caledonian Club have made, and highlights the students&rsquo; and faculty&rsquo;s continued effort to promote lifelong learning and higher education.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5104</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Hidden Killer Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Health and Safety Executive for its awareness campaign targeting tradesmen across Scotland to beware of the hidden killer of asbestos; notes that the campaign aims to raise awareness of the risks posed by asbestos and how workers can best protect themselves; further notes that official figures show that about 20 tradesmen a week in the United Kingdom die from asbestos-related diseases and that this number is rising, and urges tradesmen everywhere to pay attention to the campaign in order to protect themselves and colleagues from the threat of asbestos-related conditions.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5103</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Celebrating Charles Darwin&rsquo;s On the Origin of Species</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament joins in the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the publication of naturalist Charles Darwin&rsquo;s most famous work, <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life,</em> first published on 24 November 1859; considers that it has made an unsurpassed contribution to the understanding of evolution, natural selection and consequently the tracing of man&rsquo;s primitive beginnings; recognises the strength of the theory of evolution and considers that it has stood the test of time, despite many attempts to disprove it, for over 150 years since its publication, and notes that Darwin&rsquo;s path to prominence started as a medical student at the University of Edinburgh.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5102</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Hawthorn Housing Co-operative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hawthorn Housing Co-operative on the opening of its new offices on 30 October 2009: notes that this is the latest milestone in the life of the Hawthorn Housing Co-operative, which has since 1984 worked to improve the housing stock and environment in its area; recognises the achievements of the chair, Helen Graham, and all past and present members of the management committee for their hard work and commitment to date and the staff for their efforts on behalf of the Hawthorn Housing Co-operative, and wishes them well as they work in partnership with Maryhill Citizens Advice Bureau to improve accessibility to advice on welfare rights and with Cadder Housing Association to introduce an estate caretaking initiative.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5101</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Think Positive, Tackling Mental Ill Health among Students in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 4 November 2009 is National Stress Awareness Day; considers stress to be a contributing factor to mental ill health among students in Scotland; considers that around 160,000 students in Scotland currently at college or university will experience mental ill health; believes that great effort should be taken to improve mental health among students in Scotland, and congratulates NUS Scotland&rsquo;s Think Positive project for its work in raising awareness of student mental ill health among students, university and college staff and the general public.</p>
