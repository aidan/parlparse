    and of provision; welcomes the forthcoming establishment by the Centre for Independent
    Living of the Disabled Persons Housing Service (DPHS) in Glasgow and Renfrewshire
    following the pioneering work of the DPHS in Edinburgh; and believes that the Scottish
    Executive, local authorities and voluntary groups should make the concept of independent
    living a reality for all disabled people, in particular by including a disabled audit in
    the proposed single seller survey, setting needs-related targets for the achievement of
    more barrier free housing, reviewing the building regulations to move to the standard of
    &quot;stayability&quot;, encouraging fuller use for disabled people of housing with major
    disabled adaptations; supporting user-led DPHSs as equal partners in delivering these
    improvements and supporting adequate facilities and support for homeless disabled people.<i><strong>
