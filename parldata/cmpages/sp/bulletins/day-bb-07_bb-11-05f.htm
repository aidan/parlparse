          <p><strong>*S3M-771</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Rocket Shot Syringe Sweet</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the sale of the &quot;rocket shot&quot;, a sweet packaged in a plastic container modelled in the shape of a syringe filled with a variety of different coloured sugar liquid solutions, including red; deplores the irresponsibility on the part of the manufactures and retailers who sell this product which is targeted at children; notes with concern that the sale of such a product is not currently covered by legislation that would allow it to be banned by trading standards, and calls for the product to be withdrawn from sale immediately.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-770</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Stonewall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the actions of Stonewall in stirring up inter-community tensions by awarding the Bishop of Hereford the &quot;Bigot of the Year&quot; award which is considered to be in extreme bad taste; believes that such activities conflict with assurances given by Stonewall&rsquo;s Scottish Director to the Equal Opportunities Committee on 23 October 2007 that Stonewall wished to encourage greater work to be done with faith communities; considers that there is an irony in Stonewall campaigning for an amendment to the UK Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill to make incitement to homophobic hatred an offence while simultaneously insulting Christians in what might be regarded as an incitement of religious hatred, and calls on the Scottish Government to review its relationship with Stonewall in light of this behaviour.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-769</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Dundee Music</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Dundee-based music businesses P3 Music, <em>Clash Magazine</em> and Jack&rsquo;s Hoose which have won awards of &pound;45,000, &pound;40,000 and &pound;20,000 respectively from the Scottish Music Futures Fund; notes that Dundee has a thriving music scene which will benefit greatly from the awards; further notes that the creative industries employ 100,000 people across Scotland and have an annual turnover of &pound;2.5 billion, and supports the aim of the Scottish Music Futures Fund which is to assist those working in the music business to achieve the full economic potential of their businesses.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-767</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Changes to Housing Benefits</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great concern the changes pending in housing benefit in that thousands of tenants in the private-rented sector will have their benefit set at an average within an area, such as Glasgow, and that this will leave many with insufficient funds to meet their rent and notes, with further concern, that the Department for Work and Pensions has plans to extend the scheme to the social-rented sector.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-765&diams; </strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Extra-curricular Outdoor Education for Every School Pupil</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vital contribution that taking part in extra-curricular activities make in developing our young people; notes that extra-curricular programmes help our young people to learn new skills, to enjoy new responsibility, to appreciate the work of other people and to learn about leadership; notes the success of projects such as Crieff High School&rsquo;s Community Awareness Project, and considers that, in an age when too many of our young people are in the headlines for the wrong reasons and when there are increasing concerns about school discipline and the numbers of youngsters involved in incidents of antisocial behaviour, extra-curricular activities in schools and five days outdoor education for every school pupil in Scotland should be supported.</p>

From President Putin to members of the Royal Family, Lothian and Borders has to cope with Capital City duties&quot;, and believes that Edinburgh should be given the resources appropriate to its capital city status.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-725</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Employment Legislation and the Council of Economic Advisers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the recent comments from Sir George Mathewson, chair of  the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), regarding the impact of employment legislation on the Scottish economy; recognises that while there have been significant improvements in workers&rsquo; rights, such as the national minimum wage, new entitlements to paid holidays and increased maternity leave, employment in Scotland is at record levels; is further concerned that, while the World Bank ranks Scotland, in the United Kingdom, as sixth of 178 countries for ease of doing business, the chair of the CEA chooses to attack rights at work, and calls on the CEA to base all of its future advice to the First Minister on independent evidence and to concentrate on real issues facing the Scottish economy, such as skill shortages, low levels of business research and development investment and security of energy supplies.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-721</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Social Work Cuts Force Frail Fife Pensioners to Stay in Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses profound concern that frail and vulnerable patients in Fife who have been clinically assessed as being suitable for return to their own homes or to a residential home are being denied the right to do so as a consequence of the policy change of the SNP and Liberal Democrat-led Fife Council, where a package of &pound;600,000 cuts has been made to the social work budget; further notes that these cuts have resulted in at least one patient dying while in hospital against his will and that despite clinicians saying that he could go home he died before he could do so because of the policy decisions of the council; observes that there has been a dramatic increase since July 2007 in the number of beds being blocked for patients waiting for vital surgery, with the outcome that savings made by Fife Council are being transferred to NHS Fife, resulting in no overall saving for taxpayers who instead now have to cope with the personal tragedies that are impacting on patients, with the additional  possibility that the beds being blocked will reduce capacity as clinicians seek to prepare plans for winter when increases in flu and chest infections can rise to very high levels, depending on a variety of circumstances, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to intervene in the outrageous situation where the savings by the SNP and Liberal Democrat-controlled council has not resulted in net savings to the taxpayer but has instead caused unnecessary misery and anxiety to the patients and relatives concerned.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-718</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>British Heart Foundation Scotland&rsquo;s Heart 2 Heart Appeal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the ongoing British Heart Foundation (BHF) Scotland&rsquo;s Heart 2 Heart appeal to raise &pound;500,000 to provide specialist heart failure nurses for the Highlands and encourages MSPs and the public to do all they can to support it; is aware that heart failure is a serious and debilitating condition, for which there is no cure, affecting around 100,000 people across Scotland; notes that SIGN guideline 95 on the management of chronic heart failure recommends the provision of home-based specialist nurse-led services, which have been shown to reduce unnecessary rehospitalisation for seriously ill patients, as well as cutting premature mortality; believes that every patient experiencing heart failure who requires access to a community-based specialist heart failure nursing service should receive it, and urges NHS boards, the Scottish Government and charities like BHF Scotland to continue to work together on its provision, especially on ensuring that sustainable and viable funding for this crucial service in every part of the country is secured for the future.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-717</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Libraries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hamilton Central Library on its centenary; notes the continued contribution made by it and the numerous libraries founded by Andrew Carnegie in his homeland; believes that the public library system remains indispensable to this day to improving literacy and in extending access to factual information and the arts to all Scots, and notes the boost given by more recent advances in library provision such as the Bookstart initiative and the People&rsquo;s Network.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-716</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Organic Food</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent findings of the EU-funded Quality Low Input Food study that organic food contains fewer of the compounds that are harmful and more of those that are beneficial to health than conventionally cultivated produce; notes that the four-year, &pound;12 million project involved growing fruit and vegetables and rearing cattle on adjacent organic and non-organic sites across Europe and concluded, for example, that 40% more antioxidants could be found in organic fruit and vegetables than in non-organic varieties, while organic milk can contain up to 60% more antioxidants and desirable fatty acids than conventionally produced milk; further notes that the findings of such a large-scale study call into question the current position of the Food Standards Agency that the balance of current scientific evidence does not support the view that organically produced food is more nutritious than other food, and believes that the Scottish Government should step up its support for organic produce in light of this new EU-funded research.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-714</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Reverse Auctions on Social Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the practice of reverse auctions, whereby a ceiling price is put on a commodity and bidders are invited to tender for goods or services at a lower price; notes that this is being used by some of Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities, including South Lanarkshire Council, as a method of obtaining services in relation to social and personal care for people requiring such services, and believes that such a methodology is completely inappropriate for securing services directly impacting on vulnerable people in Scotland&rsquo;s communities, that such tendering methods should not be used and that it is morally repugnant for such a system to be used for the provision of social care services in Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-712</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Disappointment at Labour Group Voting Against Rescue Package for Scotland&rsquo;s Farmers and Crofters</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave disappointment at the disgraceful actions of the Labour group in voting against the motion on 24 October 2007 supporting a &pound;25 million rescue package for Scottish farmers and crofters affected by the foot-and-mouth outbreak; notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s aid package is twice the size of that of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for England while Scotland&rsquo;s industry is half the size; condemns Hilary Benn MP, the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for snubbing NFU Scotland, and believes that the betrayal of London Labour and Scottish Labour alike will not be forgiven by Scotland&rsquo;s farming and crofting communities.</p>
