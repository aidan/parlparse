<p align="center"><strong>Section E &ndash; Written questions lodged on 16 December 2005</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information to the Parliament.</strong></p>
<p><strong>S2W-21828</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the terms of reference were for the report prepared for it by SQW Economic Development Consultants, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21829</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the cost to it was of commissioning SQW Economic Development Consultants to investigate the economic impact of hosting the 2005 G8 summit at Gleneagles.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21830</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the detailed methodology used by SQW Economic Development Consultants was in their investigation of the economic impact of hosting the 2005 G8 summit at Gleneagles by which they measured the advertising value equivalent of the &quot;unprecedented media coverage&quot; of Scotland between 2 and 11 July 2005 as a result of the G8 summit as being worth &pound;66.4 million.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21831</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how the profile provided for Scotland as a result of the &quot;unprecedented media coverage&quot; between 2 and 11 July 2005 as a result of the G8 summit provides a platform to secure greater economic opportunity in the future across many areas, as stated by SQW Economic Development Consultants in their report on the economic impact of hosting the 2005 G8 summit at Gleneagles, and to what areas the report specifically refers.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21832</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what evidence there is that the tourism industry will be assisted by virtue of the 2005 G8 summit having been held at Gleneagles.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21833</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the terms of reference for the report prepared for it by SQW Economic Development Consultants into the economic impact of hosting the 2005 G8 summit at Gleneagles included a requirement to analyse the cost to businesses of repairing the damage to private property as a result of protests at the presence of the summit.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21834</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in its estimate that the Scottish economy benefited by Gleneagles having hosted the 2005 G8 Summit, it has accounted for the costs to repair damage to civic and private property by those protesting at the presence of the summit.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21835</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what evidence there is that there is any veracity in the statement by SQW Economic Development Consultants in their report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at </em>Gleneagles, that &quot;the profile that the Summit has generated for Scotland and the potential economic activity that this might lead to in the future is the real value of this investment&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21836</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what methodology was used by SQW Economic Development Consultants to back their statement that the total value of coverage for Scotland as a result of the 2005 G8 Summit having been held in Gleneagles in the lead-up to the summit over six months was &pound;618 million, as asserted in the report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21837</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how SQW Economic Development Consultants measured coverage of Scotland as a result of the 2005 G8 summit being held in Gleneagles as being either neutral, positive or negative in tone, as set out in the report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21838</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether SQW Economic Development Consultants offset the cost of negative coverage of Scotland against their estimate of the cost of positive coverage of Scotland in relation to Gleneagles hosting the 2005 G8 Summit, which they translated into an advertising equivalent value of &pound;66.4 million between 2 and 11 July 2005 and &pound;618 million in the wider six-month period in the lead up to the summit, as set out in their report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21839</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether, when SQW Economic Development Consultants state in their report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>, that &quot;estimating the wider costs of disruption is beyond the scope of this work&quot;, they were precluded from carrying out an analysis of the cost implications of disruption caused by the summit and costs of repairing damage to civic and private property caused by those in Scotland protesting at the presence of the summit.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21840</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether, when SQW Economic Development Consultants state in their report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>, that &quot;the G8 has a particularly high profile in Scotland&rsquo;s main tourism markets&quot;, they have treated any coverage of the 2005 G8 Summit in these places as being automatically beneficial for the tourist industry.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21841</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it will encourage public agencies and businesses to translate the fact that &quot;the G8 has a particularly high profile in Scotland&rsquo;s main tourism markets&quot; into economic opportunities for Scotland, as set out by SQW Economic Development Consultants in their report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21842</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, where SQW Economic Development Consultants identify increased costs in a number of cases caused by damages to property in their report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>, whether these costs have been included in the estimate within that report of the costs and benefits to the Scottish economy by virtue of this summit.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21843</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the effect would be of the 2005 G8 Summit being held in Gleneagles in terms of the expenditure accrued by it, as opposed to the revenue accrued to the Scottish economy by the summit, if the revenue raised by the Make Poverty History march and Live 8 event were not included in the estimate made by SQW Economic Development Consultants in their report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21844</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to the use of advertising value equivalence by SQW Economic Development Consultants in their report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>, how readily it considers articles in the media about the 2005 G8 Summit being hosted in Gleneagles can be equated with adverts showcasing Scotland as either a tourist destination or as a destination for inward investment.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21845</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how SQW Economic Development Consultants estimated that 37% of those taking part in the Make Poverty History march and 39% of those attending the Live 8 event were from outside Scotland, as set out in their report, <em>Economic Impact of Hosting the 2005 G8 Summit at Gleneagles</em>.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21846</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the average patient list is for a (a) general dental practitioner and (b) salaried dentist.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21847</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions it has had with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government in relation to the European Parliament&rsquo;s Temporary Committee of Inquiry into allegations of CIA activity in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21848</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any information that it will be making available to the European Parliament&rsquo;s Temporary Committee of Inquiry into allegations of CIA activity in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21849</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21304 by Tavish Scott on 15 December 2005, whether companies are always invited to tender or whether applications are also considered from uninvited companies.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21850</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21290 by Tavish Scott on 15 December 2005, what areas have been identifed that will experience an adverse effect on air quality as a result of the upgrade of the A80 to full motorway status.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21851</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21290 by Tavish Scott on 15 December 2005, whether, if it accepts the logic of bypassing Muirhead, Chryston and Moodiesburn with the upgraded A80, it considers it logical to bypass Cumbernauld as part of the upgrade as well and what the reasons are for its position on the issue.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21852</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21286 by Tavish Scott on 15 December 2005, whether this indicates that it has no plans to build roads for which it is responsible around Kilsyth to improve links from the town to the rest of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21853</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21288 by Tavish Scott on 15 December 2005, what the projections are for the volume of traffic per day on the A80 in (a) 2010 and (b) 2025 if the M80 was constructed through the identified Kelvin Valley Route rather than the on-line upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21854</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21289 by Tavish Scott on 15 December 2005, whether it will provide details of the integral demand management measures that might be deployed on the route of the M80 on-line upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21855</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21285 by Tavish Scott on 15 December 2005, whether its use of the word &quot;will&quot; indicates that its plans to undertake an on-line upgrade of the A80 to full motorway status have been finalised, despite the reporter in the inquiry not having yet reported his findings.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21856</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21273 by Tavish Scott on 15 December 2005, whether this indicates that the new Auchenkilns Junction is an integral part of the plan to undertake an on-line upgrade of the A80 to full motorway status.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21857</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21283 by Tavish Scott on 15 December 2005, whether it considers that an on-line upgrade of the A80 to full motorway status provides more room for the construction of a hard shoulder than would be provided by routing the M80 through the identified Kelvin Valley Route.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21858</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21260 by Cathy Jamieson on 15 December 2005, why the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) was asked to respond to this question, given that the information requested did not necessarily pertain to the SPS.</p>

<p><strong>S2W-21863</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21261 by Cathy Jamieson on 15 December 2005, why the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) was asked to respond to this question, given that the information requested did not necessarily pertain to the SPS.</p>

<p><strong>S2W-21866</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21502 by Cathy Jamieson on 14 December 2005, whether the term &quot;otherwise&quot;, as defined by section 43(1) of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989, would cover a person committed for torture.</p>

<p><strong>S2W-21870</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when the levels of Cs-137 contamination from the Chernobyl accident were last measured and what the results were for the Eskdalemuir, Langholm and Lockerbie areas of Dumfries and Galloway.</p>

<p><strong>S2W-21873</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions it has had with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to establish the nature of the business of CIA flights landing at Scottish airports which an official spokesperson for the Prime Minister identified as &quot;normal CIA business, not related to renditions&quot; in a Downing Street press briefing on 12 December 2005.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21874</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has given consideration to the comments of Rosemary Burnett of Amnesty International who was reported in <em>The</em> <em>Herald </em>on 16 December 2005 to have stated &quot;the Scottish Executive should investigate these illegal transfers as a matter of urgency. Not to do so is to aid and abet torture&quot; in respect of the allegations that US agencies have used Scottish airports to refuel for flights in which it is alleged terrorist suspects are being transported against their will and without recourse to legal representation to countries where they may be tortured for the purposes of interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21875</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has given consideration to the allegations of Amnesty International that three US agency chartered flights flew terror suspects from various locations to countries where they faced torture and on the plane&rsquo;s return to America stopped over at Glasgow Prestwick airport to refuel on each occasion, as reported in <em>The Herald</em> on 16 December 2005.</p>

<p><strong>S2W-21877</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much Forestry Commission Scotland has spent on biodiversity work in each forest district of the state forest in the last three years.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21878</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much Forestry Commission Scotland has budgeted for the next three years for biodiversity work in each forest district of the state forest.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-21879&#916;</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when it intends to publish an analysis of comments received in response to the White Paper, <em>Modernising the Planning System</em>. </p>
