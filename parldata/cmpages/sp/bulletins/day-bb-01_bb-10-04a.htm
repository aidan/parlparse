                            rates among young Scots are still rising, and therefore 
                            calls upon the Scottish Executive to cease lodging

                        Scottish Borders Council at its meeting on 1 August 2001 
                        authorised, by a majority vote, further cuts of £1,579,255 
                        to its education budget; notes that £200,000 was previously 
                        cut from the budget for the provision of special education 
                        auxiliaries; is concerned that part of these further cuts 
                        will impact on the provision of transport for children 
                        with special needs and that the intention to vire £525,000 
                        from the Excellence Fund budget to the National Grid for 
                        Learning budget will impact directly on special education

                        early intervention and learning support; believes that 
                        this matter is causing undue distress and uncertainty 
                        to parents of children with special educational needs; 
                        further notes the recommendations in the 3rd Report 2001

                        on Inquiry into Special Educational Needs, in particular,

                        believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that 
                        the provision of education for Borders children with special 
                        needs is not sacrificed to rescue the Borders administration

                        terms in order to secure a fair and inclusive education 
                        for these vulnerable children. </p>
