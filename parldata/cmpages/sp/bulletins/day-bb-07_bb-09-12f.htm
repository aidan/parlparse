          <p><strong>*S3M-451&diams; </strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Local Authority Planners Housing Development on Land Known To Be Subject to Coastal Erosion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its grave concern that local authority planning officials across Scotland appear to be ignoring the measures put in place under the national planning policy framework to stop developers building on land identified as being subject to coastal erosion; compliments Fife Council on having had the foresight to develop a coastal management plan in 1999; notes that across Scotland the public purse is having to fund coastal protection schemes costing many millions of pounds to the taxpayer, following developers leaving the public to inherit a financial responsibility stemming from their appetite to maximise profit, and hopes that the cabinet secretary with responsibility for coastal protection will bring forward legislation as a matter of urgency and call a moratorium on all planning approvals for home building across Scotland where there is the slightest question of coastal erosion having been identified, in light of the ensuing potential for costs to the public purse as well as the major issue for those left to confront the human misery when homes are damaged as a consequence of coastal erosion.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-450</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Sitting of Scottish Youth Parliament in Orkney</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Youth Parliament on its successful sitting, held in Orkney on 8 and 9 September; welcomes the decision of Members of the Scottish Youth Parliament (MSYPs) to hold their latest plenary session in Orkney as a further demonstration of the relevance of the Scottish Youth Parliament&rsquo;s work to all of Scotland; acknowledges the efforts of Orkney Islands Council staff and Orkney&rsquo;s MSYPs, Jenny Drever and Jethro Crocker, in making the sitting such a success; believes that the theme of the sitting, Sustainable Futures<em>, </em>was particularly appropriate given Orkney&rsquo;s growing reputation as a world centre of excellence for marine renewables development, and encourages MSPs to explore ways in which they can work ever more closely with John Loughton, the new Chair of the Scottish Youth Parliament, and with other MSYPs.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-449</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Broadcasting and Football</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scotland men&rsquo;s football team on defeating Lithuania 3-1 in the recent European football championships qualifier; notes the decision of the BBC to show neither the Lithuania nor France fixtures, even on BBC Scotland, in favour of other matches; believes that this is further evidence of the need for broadcasters to reflect the interests of the public they serve, whether in Scotland, Wales, England or Northern Ireland, and calls for the transfer of powers over Scottish broadcasting.</p>

It should be about public good, not private greed&quot;, and expresses the wish that the UK and Scottish governments will seek to manifest these values.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-443.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Skills Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-443) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;and urges&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that all young people should be given the opportunity to access vocational education from the age of 14; calls on the Scottish Government to consider the establishment of skills academies as part of a diverse education system, and, while welcoming the merger of Careers Scotland and learndirect Scotland, calls on the Scottish Government to go further and add the skills functions currently exercised by Scottish Enterprise to the remit of the merged body, in order to form a complete skills agency.&quot;</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-443.3</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Skills Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-443) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;the Scottish Government&rsquo;s&quot; to end and insert &quot;and regrets that the strategy contains no specific targets or indicators of success for improving skills in Scotland, fails to respond to the recommendations of the Leitch Review of Skills and makes no commitment to increased investment in further or higher education; calls on the Scottish Government to amend its strategy to include specific skills targets, including targets for modern apprenticeships and widening access, and details of how it will measure progress towards these targets and commit to report annually to the Parliament on that progress, and further calls on the Scottish Government to commit to providing an additional &pound;168 million for Scottish universities and at least a 3% real terms annual funding increase for Scotland&rsquo;s colleges over the period of the spending review to ensure that the sectors can make an increased contribution to improving skills in Scotland.&quot;</p>
