            Fisheries Council in December 2003 that delivers sustainable fisheries 
            management, sustainable fisheries and sustainable fishing businesses

                policy is repatriated to Scotland.&quot;</p>

                support the view of the vast majority of Scottish fishermen that 
                it is time to end the discredited Common Fisheries Policy and 
                to regain national control of UK waters.&quot;</p>

                to the total fishing capacity of the fleet, the establishment 
                of regeneration areas, tighter controls over industrial fisheries 
                and the widespread adoption of independent observers at sea and 
                in ports as part of a European Union-wide recovery plan, and further 
                believes that annual bartering is a fundamentally inappropriate 
                approach to the sustainable management of fisheries and that multi-annual 
                management planning is essential.&quot;</p>
