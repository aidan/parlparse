            Scotland, Minister of Greenbank Parish Church, Edinburgh </p>

            <strong>Scottish Executive's Priorities</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees that the Executive's priorities across Scotland must be to 
            deliver first class public services that help create a Scotland full 
            of opportunity, where children can reach their full potential, and 
            that in 2002 this will mean working in partnership to improve the 
            health service and the health of all, to achieve high employment and 
            promote educational opportunities, to reduce crime and the fear of 
            crime, to build an integrated transport system which meets the needs 
            of all users and to promote sustainable development across Scotland.

              to create a country in which all children can reach their full potential; 
              recognises that the Parliament has undertaken impressive work but 
              regrets the loss of trust in government caused by the actions of 
              the Executive; calls on the Executive to dramatically improve its 
              performance in delivering public services on health, education, 
              transport and jobs, crime and on the environment, and agrees that 
              only by equipping this Parliament with the powers of a normal independent 
              Parliament will Scotland be able to reach its full potential.&quot;

              that these are worthy objectives, does not believe that the approach

            notes with concern the escalation of the &quot;bus wars&quot; in the 
            city of Edinburgh, a situation which is detrimental to routes, services 
            and passengers and which results in congestion and pollution in some 
            areas, at the same time as routes and services are lost in others, 
            and urges all responsible parties to take appropriate action to address 
            this situation and to allow Scotland's capital city to develop an 
            integrated transport network in the 21st Century. </p>
