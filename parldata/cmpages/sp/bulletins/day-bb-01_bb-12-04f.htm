          <p><strong>*S1M-2513</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Inverness Highland 
            European Capital of Culture 2008 Bid </strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            congratulates all those involved in the Inverness Highland 2008 bid 
            for the title of European Capital of Culture; notes that the Inverness 
            Highland 2008 bid is the only Scottish one, and recognises that a 
            successful bid would bring important social, economic and cultural 
            rewards for Scotland in general and for Inverness and the Highlands 
            in particular.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2512</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Breaking the 
            Organised Child Sex Rings</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            that well organised and financed people are systematically abusing 
            children in the sex trade using games, alcohol and drugs to groom 
            and coerce children into sex rings who are then exploited, degraded 
            and abused by paedophile adults for money and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to resource the police to allow them to set up a task force 
            to combat child abuse in the sex trade, tackle the provision of children 
            for sex and paying for sex with children by adults and target crimes 
            against children on the internet in order to ensure a course of action 
            is followed that will break organised child sex rings and bring the 
            perpetrators of child sex abuse to justice. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2511</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Head of Communications 
            at North Ayrshire Council</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            North Ayrshire Council on appointing Mr Gerry O&#146; Brien as its 
            new head of Communications; notes Mr O&#146; Brien&#146;s previous 
            posts with the Conservative Party and the Conservative Group in the 
            Scottish Parliament; expects that Mr O&#146; Brien will have few ideological 
            problems in helping to implement new Labour policies in North Ayrshire 
            as they are mostly identical to failed Tory policies, and hopes that 
            Mr O&#146; Brien&#146;s efforts are rewarded with the same success 
            as the Tories in recent years, who have all but disappeared from the 
            electoral map in most of Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2510#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Annual St Andrew's 
            Day Cultural Celebration</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            Children in Scotland (<i>Clann an Alba</i>) on the success of its 
            Equal Futures event held on 30 November 2001 in Glasgow; notes that 
            this was attended by schoolchildren from all over Scotland with a 
            view to building racial equality and believes that St Andrew&#146;s 
            Day should be designated as an annual day of celebration of Scotland&#146;s 
            cultural diversity, with consideration given to public holiday status 
            so that everyone in Scotland can participate. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenny 
            MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Andrew Wilson<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mr Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2509</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Ministerial 
            Responsibility for Education and Schools</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that the principal day-to-day responsibility for education and 
            schools now lies with the Deputy Minister for Education and Young 
            People and not with the Minister for Education and Young People; regrets 
            that this change in responsibilities was not announced to the Parliament 
            before the vote on the appointment of Ministers, which is contrary 
            to the principles of openness and accountability on which the Parliament 
            was founded; expresses concern that there will now be no Minister 
            in the Cabinet who has hands-on responsibility for the major devolved 
            area of responsibility that covers schools and the investment that 
            education of young people makes in our society, and calls on the First 
            Minister to bring this issue to the Parliament for full debate.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2508</strong> <strong>Fiona McLeod: GM Cross Contamination</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the Mexican Government&#146;s ban on all 
            genetically modified material; is distressed that cross-contamination 
            from GM crops banned eight years ago is having a direct effect on 
            current crops; believes that the only answer is a moratorium on GM 
            field trials, and calls on the Scottish Executive to reverse its decision 
            to carry out field trials at Munlochy and other sites in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2507</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: School Education 
            (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that 
            the School Education (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Nicol Stephen<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2506</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Land Reform 
            (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees to the general 
            principles of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2505</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Aggregates Tax: 
            Lack of Scottish Exemptions</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            special exemptions from the aggregates tax are to be granted to Northern 
            Ireland following HM Treasury's pre-budget report; believes that the 
            imposition of the tax on Scotland from 1 April 2002 will be damaging 
            to the Scottish economy, especially in rural areas and will not result 
            in any environmental gain but will lead to the closure of some smaller 
            quarries, will place a greater burden of traffic on our roads and 
            will place a particular burden upon local authorities which could 
            lead to higher council taxes and/or cuts in building and roads repairs 
            programmes; further believes that the failure of the Scottish Executive 
            to accept in any way the widespread concerns on the impact of the 
            aggregates tax and its total refusal to stand up to Her Majesty's 
            Government on this issue contrasts poorly with the united approach 
            pursued by politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly and that, 
            had the coalition parties campaigned against this tax instead of refusing 
            to voice any word of criticism, Scotland too may have received valuable 
            exemptions, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to state 
            exactly what, if anything, it plans to do in relation to the imposition 
            of this tax on Scotland and to estimate what the cost to the economy 
            will be from it. </p>
