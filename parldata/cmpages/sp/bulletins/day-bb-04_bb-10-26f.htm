          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1882</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Tackling Drugs Misuse: Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s integrated approach to reducing the supply of drugs and protecting communities from drug-related offending, improving education and information for young people about the risks from drugs and increasing the range and effectiveness of local drug treatment and rehabilitation services to help people to become free from drug dependence.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1881</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Energy Efficiency Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Energy Efficiency Week between 25 and 31 October 2004&nbsp;and recognises the report, <em>Forecasting The Future</em>, published by the Energy Saving Trust to launch the week; notes with concern the report&rsquo;s findings that climate change could result in &pound;200 billion of property and infrastructure damage from flooding and coastal erosion in the United Kingdom by 2050; notes with concern that <em>Key Scottish Environment Statistics 2004,</em> published by the Scottish Executive, shows that Scotland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change are again increasing; notes with concern the lack of a specific Scottish target for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; regards energy efficiency as an essential way of reducing emissions that contribute to climate&nbsp;change, and&nbsp;recognises that measures, such as improving the energy efficiency of Scotland&rsquo;s housing stock, will also reduce the impact of fuel poverty but &nbsp;also that any improvements in energy efficiency in the home are being undermined by transport policies that promote ever greater car use and more and more air travel and that support for action on energy efficiency by any group or political party must be matched by calls for abandoning road-building projects such as the M74 and the Aberdeen&nbsp;bypass and abandoning support for expanding air travel that will lead to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1880#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Vote for Trade Justice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the mass lobby of the Scottish Parliament in support of the Vote for Trade Justice campaign between 12 and 2 pm on 27 October 2004; further notes that each Member of the Scottish Parliament has been challenged to cast their vote for trade justice in a giant trade justice ballot box; also notes that Elaine C Smith will chair an open-air rally in support of trade justice, and believes that members should support the reform of unjust and unfair trade rules, for which the trade justice campaign calls, through this and other actions.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1879</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (Orkney) (No.4) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (Orkney) (No.4) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/417) be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1878</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.11) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.11) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/418) be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1877#</strong> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> <strong>Launch of the Gretna-Lockerbie-Annan Economic Regeneration Prospectus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch earlier this year of the prospectus published by the Corridor Regeneration Strategy Steering Group outlining key objectives and a number of themes to stimulate economic growth in Gretna, Lockerbie and Annan to address the impact on the area of the cessation of power production at Chapelcross; notes that the regeneration strategy, with its four principal themes of wealth, diversity, inspiration and inclusion, recognises not only the challenges that the Gretna-Lockerbie-Annan corridor now faces, but also the opportunities to be seized; congratulates the steering group on its genuine joined-up and cross-party working to date, and believes that the Scottish Executive should provide all the support that it can to the steering group&rsquo;s work and to the regeneration of the Gretna-Lockerbie-Annan corridor.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1858*#*</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Direct Payments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates those local authorities that actively promote direct payments for people in their area; notes that, since 1 June 2003, local authorities have had a statutory duty to provide direct payments; believes that the use of direct payments can encourage choice and independence, provide flexibility to respond to changing needs and enable tailor-made packages of care to be put in place; acknowledges the positive policy framework established by the Scottish Executive but recognises, however, that there are sometimes substantial differences in approach and implementation from one local authority to the next, and therefore *considers that* the Executive *should* encourage and monitor the uptake of direct payments.</p>
