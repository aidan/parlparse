            Campbell: United States Government Rejection of UN Chemical Warfare 
            Accord</strong>—That the Parliament congratulates the 54 countries, including 
            the United Kingdom, who on 25 July 2001 backed a draft protocol aimed 
            at enforcing the 1972 United Nations Treaty banning the use of chemical 
            and biological weapons; notes with regret the decision of the United 
            States Government to reject the accord which is the result of seven 
            years of international negotiations, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government 
            to continue attempts to persuade the United States Government to reverse 
            its decision.</font></p>

            Adam: Market Measures and Welfare Disposal Scheme for Lambs and Ewes</strong>—That 
            the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to implement market measures, 
            including a welfare disposal scheme, for lambs and ewes.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2090</strong> <strong>Brian

            Parliament applauds the pioneering medical imaging work of Professor 
            John Mallard and his team at the University of Aberdeen; recognises 
            the importance of this work in the development of MRI scanners and 
            other medical diagnostic techniques, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body to honour this work and that of other scientists in 
            Scotland in the new Parliament building.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2089</strong> <strong>Mr 
            Keith Harding: Record Council House Rent Arrears in Scotland</strong>—That 
            the Parliament notes with dismay that the annual amount of council 
            house rent arrears in Scotland has risen from £40 million in 1997 
            to £60 million last year; further notes that if collection levels 
            had been maintained at 1997 levels an extra £40 million would have 
            been available for projects such as improvement and homelessness programmes 
            or for even lower rents over the past three years, and believes that 
            this position is a damming indictment of the appalling management 
            of council finances exhibited particularly by Labour administrations.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2088#</strong> <strong>Irene 
            McGugan: Waste Incinerators</strong>—That the Parliament notes with concern 
            that at least five large new incinerators are being planned for siting 
            around Scotland, despite the growing evidence that they may frequently 
            emit a cocktail of toxic chemicals which breach legal pollution limits 
            and raise health concerns; further notes that the defect ridden Baldovie 
            incinerator in Dundee reported 18 separate breaches of safety limits 
            within a five week period earlier this year, which more than justifies 
            the concerns of communities in Aberdeen about the planned Altens incinerator; 
            is concerned that although 60% of the waste produced in Scotland is 
            biodegradable, only 6.6% of it was recycled last year, thereby placing 
            Scotland at the bottom of the European recycling league; commends 
            the first area waste plan in Scotland which opts for the recycling 
            of waste rather than the burning of it, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should implement policies which promote a resource efficient, 
            recycling society.</font></p>

            McLeod: UN Children's Summit: 19-21 September 2001</strong>—That the Parliament 
            welcomes the United Nations Special Session on Children 2001 which 
            will take place in New York from 19 to 21 September 2001; commends 
            the recognition that this accords to the need for adults to listen 
            to the views of young people; congratulates Save the Children for 
            organising their &quot;world fit for children&quot; event in Edinburgh 
            to coincide with this summit; notes the recent publication of the 
            Education, Culture and Sport Committee’s consultation paper, <i>Improving 
            Consultation with Children and Young People in Relevant Aspects of 
            Policy-Making and Legislation in Scotland</i>, and believes that a 
            &quot;Children and Young people’s summit&quot; should be held by the 
            Parliament annually.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2086</strong> <strong>Fiona

            welcomes the recently established &quot;e-mission 55 – Business for 
            Climate&quot; initiative; commends the 90-plus companies who have 
            grouped together under this collective to call on governments around 
            the world to finalise the Kyoto Protocol; congratulates them for exceeding 
            their original target of 55, and urges Scottish businesses to sign 
            up to this initiative.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2085</strong> <strong>Mr

            Development) (Scotland) Amendment (No.2) Order 2001 (SSI 2001/266) 
            which requires planning permission for mobile telecommunications masts; 
            notes with concern the lack of any specific controls relating to ecclesiastical 
            buildings and their exemption from the Order, and considers that the 
            Parliament should be given the opportunity to debate this issue and 
            other aspects of the Order.</font></p>
