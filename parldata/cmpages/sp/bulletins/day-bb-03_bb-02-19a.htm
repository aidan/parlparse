          <p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Debate on Fisheries-</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3914</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Fisheries</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the Executive's commitment of up to £50 million 
            in aid to assist fishermen, on-shore fisheries businesses and fishing 
            communities throughout Scotland as a very substantial response to 
            the outcome of the EU Fisheries Council in December 2002; welcomes 
            the result of quota negotiations in the nephrops fishery and the progress 
            made in reforms to the Common Fisheries Policy at that Council; endorses 
            the need for sustainable economic development of Scotland's fishing 
            industry and communities; recognises this can best be achieved through 
            healthier fish stocks; acknowledges this implies further restructuring 
            of the white fish sector; welcomes the provision of up to £40 million 
            for further decommissioning; welcomes the provision of up to £10 million 
            in transitional support to facilitate rational economic planning and 
            adjustment by those who wish to remain in the sector; notes that such 
            transitional support will be conditional upon, for example, non-diversification 
            into other valuable fisheries, such as the west coast and North Sea 
            nephrops fisheries, and supports the Executive in its negotiations 
            to secure a more economically realistic EU legal framework initially 
            through amendment to the current interim EU regulation and thereafter 
            through a successor regime.</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3914.1</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Fisheries</strong>-As 
              an amendment to motion (S1M-3914) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave 
              out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;condemns 
              the deal supported by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, 
              Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at December's 
              EU Fisheries Council; agrees with the Minister for Environment and 
              Rural Development that the deal is &quot;inequitable, unfair and 
              even crude&quot;; rejects the scale of the decommissioning element 
              of the Scottish Executive's subsequent aid package and calls on 
              ministers to agree with industry representatives a recovery plan 
              that includes appropriate assistance for the catching, processing 
              and service sectors and ensures as far as possible that the industry 
              remains intact; believes that Her Majesty's Government and the European 
              Commission should provide funding towards such a recovery plan; 
              demands that the Executive and Her Majesty's Government renegotiate 
              immediately the days at sea and quota cuts with a view to replacing 
              these measures at the earliest opportunity with a management regime 
              that promotes sustainability and protects the future of our fishing 
              communities; urges ministers to ensure that Scotland's quota allocations 
              only benefit active fishermen in Scotland, and recognises that the 
              Common Fisheries Policy must be replaced by a policy that returns 
              genuine control of our fishing grounds to the Parliament.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3914.2</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor: Fisheries</strong>-As

              out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises 
              that the results of the EU Fisheries Council in December were disastrous 
              for Scotland; notes the severity of the crisis now facing the Scottish 
              fishing industry; believes that the effects of the conservation 
              measures already taken by Scottish fishermen have not been taken 
              into full consideration; further notes the Scottish Executive's 
              £50 million aid package but questions the balance of allocation 
              between decommissioning and transitional funding, and notes that 
              the Common Fisheries Policy of collective management has been disastrous 
              for the Scottish fishing industry and must be replaced and that 
              only a move to national and local control will bring sustainability 
              to the Scottish fishing industry in the future.&quot;</a></p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3864</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Location 
            of a New Hospital for Forth Valley</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the announcement by the Forth Valley NHS Board that its favoured location 
            for a new single-site hospital for Forth Valley is the Royal Scottish 
            National hospital site at Larbert; further notes that the board is 
            to undertake further work including a feasibility study and transport 
            impact assessment before submitting its outline business case to the 
            Scottish Executive this summer; recognises that the Scottish Executive 
            and the Minister for Health and Community Care retain the ultimate 
            say over the location of the proposed new hospital for the area, and 
            believes that the Executive should consider any case for a new hospital 
            in the context of the accessibility of the hospital to the public 
            and the consequential arrangements for community health care throughout 
            the Forth Valley NHS Board area. </p>
