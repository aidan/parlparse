            Stevenson: Primary Health Care in Rural Scotland</strong>—That the Parliament 
            expresses grave concern over the increasing centralisation of many 
            health care services, currently provided efficiently and effectively 
            within the primary care sector, into large central units primarily 
            concerned with expensive acute care provision; notes the uncertainty 
            surrounding Chalmers Hospital in Banff as an example of the threat 
            to such services, and believes that the Executive should review policy 
            direction to NHS boards in order to emphasise that community facilities 
            must always be the preferred option.</font></p>
