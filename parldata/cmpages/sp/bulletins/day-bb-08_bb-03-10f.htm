<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1523</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>The Plight of Burma&rsquo;s Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great concern a recent report in <em>The Irrawaddy News </em>on the poor treatment of Burmese detainees, many of them children, in Mae Sot, Thailand; recognises the plight of millions of Burmese children, who have long been subjected to starvation and maltreatment by the country&rsquo;s cruel military dictatorship; laments the misfortune of those children who have attempted to escape this miserable life only to end up in situations like those described in the report, and in accord with the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child affirms the right of every child to have his or her basic needs fulfilled.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1522</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Biggar - Scotland&rsquo;s Third Transition Town</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Biggar on becoming Scotland&rsquo;s third official &quot;transition town&quot;, joining Portobello and Dunbar; notes that the &quot;transition town&quot; network of towns, cities and islands across the world have recognised the urgent need to prepare for and mitigate the impact of peak oil and climate change in the near future; welcomes the community-based nature of the movement; believes that transition towns provide an important model for the approach of wider society to climate change, and encourages as many towns and communities in Scotland as possible to consider adopting the transition town approach.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1481</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Tax Havens and Relative Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the recent call by Germany for an EU-wide debate on tax havens; notes that the super-rich use European tax havens, such as the Channel Islands, to avoid paying billions of Euros to members of the European Union; holds that tax avoidance and evasion is inimical to tackling relative poverty and that, in developed countries, relative poverty is at least as detrimental to health, happiness and longevity as is absolute poverty; notes that the funds released by eliminating tax avoidance and evasion could significantly reduce relative poverty and that relative poverty and child poverty, as noted by motion S3M-1474, is a major problem in Scotland; considers, however, that the abuse of tax havens is global; therefore welcomes Barack Obama&rsquo;s proposed Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, and calls on governments worldwide to examine their relationships with businesses that expatriate profits through the use of tax havens.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1480</strong> <strong>Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Damian&rsquo;s Law</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled that innocent individuals continue to be murdered in random unprovoked knife attacks in Scotland; shares the anger of the communities of Greenock and elsewhere that a number of these offences are committed by offenders with previous convictions for knife crime; regrets that, despite law reform and concerted efforts by the Scottish Executive, police and others, too many individuals still carry a weapon as a matter of course; agrees that knife-carriers need to be taught that their actions have consequences before they rob someone of their life, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to examine the imposition of mandatory custodial sentences for unlawful possession of knives and other bladed weapons as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1479</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Milton of Campsie Athlete to Carry Olympic Torch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kirsty McWilliam of Milton of Campsie who has been given the honour of taking part in a prestigious Olympic ceremony; notes that Kirsty will be participating in the Olympic Torch Relay, which spans 22 cities and five continents, ahead of the Olympic Games in Beijing in August 2008; recognises that 17-year-old Kirsty is the under-19 British Triathlon Champion and won a bronze medal at last summer&rsquo;s European championships, and notes that she is currently ranked third in Europe and seventh in the world.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1478</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Venezuelan Oil Assets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision on 7 February 2008 by a court in England to grant an injunction to US multinational oil company ExxonMobil, freezing the US $12 billion assets held by the Venezuelan oil company PDVSA in England and Wales; further notes that the action was in response to the policy of the Venezuelan Government to take back majority control of its own oil resources, that the Venezuelan Government was given no notice of the case and was not afforded any opportunity to be represented at the hearing; believes that the action by ExxonMobil contravenes the right of the democratically elected government of Venezuela to exercise sovereignty over its natural resources, a right that properly belongs to all countries of the world; supports Venezuela&rsquo;s national sovereignty, including the right to determine its own policy in relation to its oil and natural resources, and calls on government at all levels in the United Kingdom to support efforts to have the dispute resolved by the World Bank&rsquo;s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1476</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Rail Services in Airdrie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Jamie Hepburn MSP&rsquo;s call for rail improvements in Central Scotland, including a better rail service for Airdrie; notes that the Airdrie to Bathgate rail link was agreed by the previous administration and included the provision of a railway station at Plains; condemns the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision not to proceed with a station at Plains, despite the massive difference that it would make to the local community and local economy, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider this matter urgently to ensure that the people of Plains in Airdrie have a direct link to the new Airdrie to Bathgate rail link.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1476.1</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Rail Services in Airdrie</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1476) in the name of Karen Whitefield, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the link, reaffirmed by the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change in the Parliament on 21 February 2008; notes that the Scottish Government is investing record levels in the rail network in Scotland, including progressing the Airdrie-Bathgate rail link, and has made the same commitment to new stations as the previous administration; notes that there have been cost overruns and delays in other transport infrastructure projects commissioned by the previous administration; calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that options for additional stops and further improvement in the Airdrie to Bathgate line are left open for future development, and considers that the text of motion S3M-1476 is at best political opportunism and at worst an attempt at misrepresentation of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on this issue.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1474</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Affairs Committee: Report on Child Poverty in Scotland (HC 277)</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent report on child poverty in Scotland by Westminster&rsquo;s Scottish Affairs Committee which shows that Scotland is doing better than the United Kingdom as a whole at reducing child poverty; notes, however, that the rate of reduction in child poverty may be slowing and that recent reductions in child poverty rates may not have fully benefited children in the most severe poverty; notes the recommendation that the position of young single adults should be improved and, accordingly, that age-based discrimination in the tax and benefits system should end; notes that a significant proportion of children living in poverty come from households where at least one parent is working and the committee&rsquo;s consequent recommendation that the problems of low pay, job retention and career advancement be tackled; further notes the committee&rsquo;s emphasis on the importance of suitable and affordable childcare, especially with respect to disabled children, as well as its emphasis on the importance of the contribution to society made by full-time carers; also notes its criticism of the complexity of the tax credit system; supports its call for the UK and Scottish governments (where relevant) to do more to simplify the benefits system, to improve awareness of entitlements and to constantly review the effectiveness of programmes designed to tackle child poverty, and, especially, calls for poverty-reduction programmes to be focussed mainly on those in the deepest poverty and on families with disabled members.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1399.1</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to City of Edinburgh Council on an Excellent Budget</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1399) in the name of Mike Pringle, leave out from &quot;congratulates&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes with grave concern the recent budget of the SNP/Liberal Democrat City of Edinburgh Council which will have a negative impact on services for children and young people across the city; particularly deplores the 1.5% cut from devolved schools&rsquo; budgets resulting in at least a &pound;10,000 reduction per average primary school, &pound;10,000 reduction per average special school and &pound;50,000 reduction per average secondary school; further deplores the council&rsquo;s award-winning youth services being reduced by &pound;357,000, Community Learning and Development being cut by the full-year equivalent of &pound;850,000, and all school meals being increased by an inflation-busting 10p, and believes that the SNP/Liberal Democrat council budget will thus result in the loss of much-needed local services for young people in both schools and the wider community throughout Edinburgh.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1323*#*</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Increasing Access to Insulin Pumps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the considerable benefits that insulin pumps have for diabetics to help them to manage their condition; notes with concern the current restrictive criteria for eligibility for use of insulin pumps which have contributed to insulin pump usage in Scotland being among the lowest in Western Europe, with only around 0.75% of people with Type 1 diabetes using pumps in Scotland compared with 15 to 20% in the United States of America and Germany; is concerned at the extreme regional disparity in uptake of insulin pumps across NHS boards, with only two patients receiving insulin pump therapy in NHS Ayrshire and Arran compared with 42 in NHS Tayside in the most recent figures, despite all NHS boards having received funding for access to insulin pumps; supports the campaign of Diabetes UK to increase access to insulin pumps and welcomes the review being undertaken currently by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the eligibility for use of pumps in the NHS, and *believes that further steps should be taken to ensure* that new NICE guidance that seeks to relax access criteria is adopted swiftly in Scotland, to support all NHS boards to increase access to insulin pumps for patients with diabetes and to enable more training for health practitioners to support patients in moving to the use of pumps where it is clearly of benefit in the management of their diabetes.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1000#</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Make Scotland&rsquo;s Roads Safer - Reduce the Drink Driving Limit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the British Medical Association&rsquo;s (BMA) Christmas card campaign calling for a reduction in the drink driving limit; notes that there is clear evidence that shows that drivers who exceed 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood are significantly impaired; further notes with regret that in the Highlands and Islands there are 27% more accidents caused by drunk drivers than the national average; joins the BMA in considering that more pressure should be exerted on the UK Government to lower the drink driving limit from 80mg per 100ml of blood to 50mg; supports the implementation of random testing, which would undoubtedly act as a further deterrent to drink driving, and notes that these measures will make Scotland&rsquo;s roads safer and could save as many as 65 lives a year on UK roads.</p>
