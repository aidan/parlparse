          <p><strong>*S1M-2930</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Inverness Air Links 
            - Public Service Obligation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the huge significance of direct links between Inverness Airport and 
            London hub airports to the economic and social well-being of the Highlands 
            and Islands, particularly in relation to tourism, exports, the business 
            economy and employment; notes that the peripherality of Inverness 
            and the dependence of the Highlands on air transport are unusual in 
            UK terms and that other transport links from the north of Scotland 
            cannot provide an adequate substitute for the established air links; 
            believes that the absence of a fast alternative adds weight to the 
            case for the imposition of a Public Service Obligation (PSO) which 
            would allow the ring-fencing of the Gatwick slots, which is necessary 
            for the continued operation of the service; further believes that 
            early implementation of a PSO is crucial, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to press further the case for a PSO with the Department 
            for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and press for that 
            Department to approach the European Commission on this matter as was 
            done by the previous Minister for Transport and Planning.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2929 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Substitution on Committees</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            agrees that Cathy Peattie be the nominated committee substitute for 
            the Labour Party on the Education, Culture and Sport Committee as 
            permitted under Rule 6.3A. </p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2928 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary

            <dir>

          <dir> 
            <dir> 
              <p>the Pig Industry Restructuring (Capital Grant) (Scotland) Scheme 
                2002 (SSI 2002/43); and</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2926#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Teenage Cancer 
            Trust - Beatson Oncology Unit</strong>&#151;That the Parliament pledges 
            its support to the campaign to raise £750,000 for the first ever specialist 
            teenage cancer ward to be set up in Scotland by the Teenage Cancer 
            Trust at the Beatson Oncology Unit in Glasgow.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2925</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Ethical Threads</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the introduction of the &quot;Ethical Threads&quot; 
            branding; notes that tee-shirts carrying the brand are sourced from 
            ethically sound companies and co-operatives that employ good labour 
            practices, provide safe and hygienic working conditions and pay workers 
            a living wage; further notes that the vast majority of tee-shirts 
            currently sold in the music merchandising sector are produced by sweatshop 
            labour, and therefore calls on the musical artists and promotion companies 
            of Scotland to adopt the Ethical Threads trademark as a means of insisting 
            that sweatshop exploitation plays no further part in the music merchandising 
            business.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2924</strong> <strong>Ian Jenkins: Bill McLaren</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates Bill McLaren on his remarkable career 
            in broadcasting as the unmistakable voice of rugby football, a career 
            spanning fifty years in the course of which he has become recognised 
            as a much admired ambassador for rugby, for Scotland and for the Borders.</p>
