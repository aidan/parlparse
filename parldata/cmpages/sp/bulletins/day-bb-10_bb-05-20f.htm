<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section </a>the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6369 Jack McConnell: Why Women Can&rsquo;t Wait</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises what it considers to be the vital, yet unrecognised, role that women play in the fight against hunger; believes that poor women hold the key to tackling hunger and malnutrition because they are largely responsible for buying, selling, cooking and growing food in the developing world, yet they remain largely overlooked by current agricultural policies; recognises that there are over a billion people going to bed hungry each night, the majority of whom are women; commends Concern Worldwide for its Woman Can&rsquo;t Wait campaign, which seeks to highlight this important issue with world leaders in advance of the UN Millennium Development Goals summit in September 2010, and encourages people to sign up to the Woman Can&rsquo;t Wait campaign in order to send a strong message to decision makers that urgent action on hunger is needed, these remarkable women can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6368 Christine Grahame: Brain Injury Awareness Week, 17 to 24 May</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that each year more than 13,000 Scots develop an acquired brain injury through trauma, stroke, hypoxia, hypoglycaemia and infections affecting the brain; recognises the importance of specialist care in tackling the effects of acquired brain injury, promoting survival and enabling people to recover afterwards; believes that everyone with an acquired brain injury should be able to access the best possible care, and supports the work of the Scottish Head Injury Forum<strong>, </strong>a coalition of individuals, charities and health and social care professionals that is working towards agreed standards of care, better access to information and help with patient and carer choices and decision making in a complex care system.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6367 Christine Grahame: Heritage Award for Johnstons</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Johnstons of Elgin on winning the Heritage Award at the Fashion and Textile Export Awards on 13 May 2010 and notes that the company&rsquo;s knitwear factory in Hawick continues to be at the heart of its business, which not only employs Borderers but 700 people across Scotland, workers who are highly skilled craftsmen and women, many from the same family, ensuring that skills are passed on through the generations and represented from start to finish in the contemporary cashmere product of today.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6366&diams;

<p><strong>*S3M-6357 Joe FitzPatrick: Computer Games Tax Relief</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that although the UK Government is planning to present an emergency budget in the coming weeks, it has not yet stated a position on granting the tax relief for the UK&rsquo;s computer games&rsquo; development industry that it considers necessary to enable the industry to be on a level playing field with competitors around the world; considers that this industry is vitally important to the UK economy and particularly the city of Dundee, where it employs approximately 3,000 people; understands that the current UK tax regime puts British companies in this industry at a competitive disadvantage compared to those in countries such as France, Canada, Japan and South Korea where it believes governments are more welcoming; considers that the cost of granting such tax relief would be extremely small in comparison to the return on the investment and would play a key role in economic recovery; encourages discussions with major stakeholders such as TIGA (The Independent Game Developers Association) regarding the resolution of this issue, and invites the newly appointed Minister for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt, to visit Dundee to note first hand the impact that the industry has on the city and the UK.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6355 John Wilson: Scottish Agricultural Wages Board Increases Agricultural Wage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board for its decision to increase the minimum wage rate of those working in the agricultural sector; notes that, as a result of this decision, those in their initial 26 weeks of employment would receive a 2.8% increase while those employed in agriculture for more than 26 weeks would see an increase of 3%; recognises that this is substantially greater than the proposed increase of only 2.2% in the national minimum wage for those in other areas of the economy, and considers that this greater increase will have a significant effect on those in the agricultural industry during this period of economic uncertainty.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6352 Robert Brown: Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by Scotland&rsquo;s Commissioner for Children and Young People of the report, <em>Perspectives of Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison; </em>notes with concern the finding that each year in Scotland as many as 16,500 children will experience the imprisonment of a parent, more than will experience parental divorce; further notes the findings that children of imprisoned parents are at a higher risk of developing behavioural, mental health and general health problems and are more likely to engage in future criminal behaviour themselves than their counterparts; recognises that children are often the innocent and overlooked victims of these criminal events and considers that they do not currently receive the necessary support to deal with such trauma; urges the Scottish Government to put in place an effective framework of support and intervention for vulnerable children affected by parental imprisonment, and encourages the Scottish Government to invest in these children now instead of storing up social problems for the future.</p>

<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-6350.3 Robert Brown: Protection for Workers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6350) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end &quot;; recognises that attacks on public sector workers are treated with gravity under existing law, and believes that effective prosecution through the courts of such offences and the further development of non-legislative measures, including evidence sharing and partnership working, are an appropriate response to violence against workers delivering a public service.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6349.1 Charlie Gordon: High Speed Rail Link</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6349) in the name of Stewart Stevenson, leave out from first &quot;and&quot; to end and insert &quot;, the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee  and Network Rail, among others, which have developed the case for high-speed rail in the United Kingdom during the last year; notes the strong economic and environmental case for extending high-speed rail to Scotland; notes the opportunity to engage with the new Westminster administration to secure Scotland&rsquo;s place in a UK high-speed rail network, and supports work to bring high-speed rail to Scotland at the earliest opportunity,   as well as supporting interim steps to reduce rail journey times between Scotland and London&quot;.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6349.4 Patrick Harvie: High Speed Rail Link</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6349) in the name of Stewart Stevenson, leave out from second &quot;and&quot; to end and insert &quot;case for extending high-speed rail to Scotland; notes that the environmental case for high speed rail is dependent on a reduction in aviation capacity, which neither the UK nor the Scottish Government has explicitly endorsed, as well as on the promotion of other low-carbon transport modes; considers that demand management also has a role to play in reducing the environmental impact of transport; notes the opportunity to engage with the new Westminster administration to secure a sustainable approach to transport demand as well as Scotland&rsquo;s place in a UK high-speed rail network, and supports work to bring high-speed rail to Scotland and to cut the number of domestic flights at the earliest opportunity.&quot;</p>
