<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#sec">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4954</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Upgrading Edinburgh Sports Pavilions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the campaigning initiative of Hutchison Vale FC young footballers for increased funding for Edinburgh sports pavilions; notes that the City of Edinburgh Council has earmarked &pound;4 million to replace three crumbling pavilions; recognises that more major investment is required to ensure that this is no longer seen as a &quot;Cinderella service&quot;, and believes that, at a time when it is vitally important that young people are encouraged to take up competitive sport, it is unacceptable that changing facilities are squalid and not fit for purpose.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4953</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>International Week Against Pain - 16 to 22 October 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all organisations supporting people who live with constant chronic pain conditions; welcomes the various worldwide events taking place during International Week Against Pain; agrees that pain relief is a human right, as identified by the World Health Organisation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the recommendations of the McEwen report are implemented across Scotland without further delay.</p>
<p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4952</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>French Lower House Approves Armenia Genocide Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the lower house of the French Parliament approved a Bill on 12 October 2006 making it a crime to deny that the Ottoman Turkish authorities committed genocide against the Armenians during the First World War; congratulates the lower house of the French Parliament on making this form of Holocaust-denial illegal, despite protests from the current authorities of the Republic of Turkey, and notes reports that the Republic of Turkey has practised and continues to practise severe repression against ethnic minorities such as the Kurds, against religious minorities such as Alevi Muslims and against socialists and other political opponents.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4951</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Stirling Tenants for Rejecting Stock Transfer Plans</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the vote by tenants of Stirling Council to reject housing stock transfer proposals; believes that the overwhelming result of 69% to 31% represents a knock-out blow for the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s flagship policy of housing stock transfer, which many consider to be privatisation by the back door, following as it does the similar vote by Edinburgh tenants last year; congratulates the &quot;no&quot; campaign on its ability to counteract the expensive propaganda and ultimately wasted public money spent promoting privatisation, and believes that it is now incumbent on the Executive to realise that the writing is on the wall for housing stock transfer, that tenants across Scotland reject it and demand instead to see meaningful investment in publicly owned, affordable to all, social housing for rent to ensure that everyone has a home fit for the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4950</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>UK Residents Detained in Guantanamo Bay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the continuing refusal of the UK Government to demand the release of Omar Deghayes, Jamil el-Banna and Bisher al-Rawi, who have been detained in Guantanamo Bay since 2002; notes that Mr el-Banna and Mr Deghayes have previously been accepted into the United Kingdom as refugees at risk of persecution or torture in their home countries; believes that this country owes a duty of care to those it has provided with refuge, and urges the UK Government to act to uphold the human rights of all those detained in Guantanamo Bay and, in particular, those whose normal place of residence is the United Kingdom.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4949</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Human Rights in Mexico</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its grave concern about the situation in Oaxaca, Mexico; notes that, according to Amnesty International, there have been reports of arbitrary arrests, threats, beatings and intimidation of protestors who are calling for the resignation of Oaxaca&rsquo;s governor, that attacks on the protestors have resulted in at least six deaths and that other activists have &quot;disappeared&quot;, and urges Mexico&rsquo;s federal government to desist from repressive actions against the people of Oaxaca and to ensure that the human rights of all protestors are respected, including the right to demonstrate peacefully and not to be arbitrarily detained or subject to threats, harassment or ill-treatment, and that all measures taken to address the crisis in Oaxaca fully respect international human rights law and do not contribute to a worsening pattern of human rights violations in Mexico.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4948</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Attacks on Fire Engine Crews</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the recent stone-throwing attack on a fire fighter in Ayrshire and the rising number of such attacks in the Strathclyde area and calls for more funding and resources to be made available by the Scottish Executive to local fire services to allow more work with local schools and youth groups to highlight the invaluable work performed by fire fighters and to build bridges between emergency service workers and local youths.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4947</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Strike by Passport Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the 24-hour strike by Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) members at passport offices across Britain, including the one in Glasgow, on Friday 13 October, in pursuit of a 4.4% wage claim; regrets both the unfortunate disruption that will caused to the general public and that the action is necessary, but believes the union is entitled to feel aggrieved that some two months after the agreed settlement date for the pay negotiations no offer has yet been made, and believes that this effective pay freeze is part of a wider attack on the public sector where workers pay and conditions and pension rights are being diminished and that continuous privatisation eats away at the quality of service to the public.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4946</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>North Korean Nuclear Missiles and Non-Proliferation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes the test firing of a nuclear weapon by the North Korean Government represents a severe blow to the world&rsquo;s nuclear non-proliferation programme; notes that this test now takes the number of countries with nuclear weapons to nine: Russia with 16,000 weapons, the United States of America with 10,300 weapons, China with 410 weapons, France with 350 weapons, the United Kingdom with 200 weapons, India with 100 weapons, Israel with 100 weapons, Pakistan with 100 weapons and North Korea with 13 weapons; also notes that this test could accelerate similar test programmes underway in Iran, Japan, Brazil and South Korea; believes that the recent sabre-rattling by George Bush against North Korea and the presence of 37,000 US troops amassed on its border stoked fears in Pyongyang of another US invasion and, therefore, inexorably propelled their weapons testing programme; calls for greater understanding of North Korea and greater engagement with this enigmatic regime and the pressing needs of its people, and calls for the UK Government to press the case for all nine countries with nuclear weapons to sign up to, and honour, the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4945</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Behic Asci and Friends</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Turkey&rsquo;s authorities place many of the country&rsquo;s prisoners in solitary confinement; is concerned to note that such prisoners are particularly vulnerable to abuse by guards and that, since December 2000, 128 prisoners and their supporters have been killed by state forces or have died on hunger strike while opposing solitary confinement; notes that Behic Asci, a lawyer in Istanbul, Gulcan Goruroglu, a woman in the city of Adana, and Sevgi Saymaz, a woman inmate in Usak Prison, are on hunger strike opposing solitary confinement in Turkey&rsquo;s prisons; further notes that they are in danger of death like so many before them because the Turkish authorities have refused to give up their use of solitary confinement, and calls on the Turkish authorities to end these practices so as to prevent further deaths among prisoners and their supporters outside the prisons.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4944</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Camanachd Chooses Life</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that in Scotland men are at greater risk of taking their own lives and that they have difficulty in accessing mental health services, especially in rural areas and therefore congratulates the Camanachd Association and all 53 shinty clubs affiliated to it for their initiative in working with NHS Highland and the Choose Life campaign to help to raise awareness of helplines and other assistance available to people at risk of suicide.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4943</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>End Mental Health Discrimination in Employment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the discrimination suffered by those with mental health problems; notes that whilst 75% of all working-age adults are in work, only 20% of those with mental health problems are in work; further notes that one-third of those with mental health problems say they have been sacked or forced to resign because of their condition, with another 40% saying that they have been denied employment because of their history of psychiatric treatment; is concerned that despite the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, a recent survey showed that 63% of employers would not recruit people with mental health problems, and, given the scale of the problem, calls on the Scottish Executive to adopt the voluntary code for employers issued by the Westminster Government and to incorporate it into the conditions of service for public sector workers throughout Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4942</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Lothian Alliance Against Depression: Anti-stigma Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that, partially because of the stigma surrounding mental illness, as many as 75% of people suffering from depression do not seek help from their GP; therefore welcomes the launch of the &quot;Mother, father, son, daughter&quot; anti-stigma campaign by Lothian Alliance Against Depression, and congratulates Depression Alliance Scotland, the University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian for the initiative.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4941</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>ID Cards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Home Office has released figures stating that the cost of introducing ID cards will be &pound;5.4 billion over the next 10 years; further notes that there is widespread concern about such cards on the grounds of civil liberties, and considers that the &pound;5.4 billion would be better spent on reducing the massive levels of poverty and inequality in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4940</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Eejits</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Itchy Coo publications on the success of its book, <em>Eejits</em>, a best selling Scots translation of Roald Dahl&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s classic, <em>The Twits</em>, and on the work of its development officer, Matthew Fitt, who translated<em> Eejits</em>, who made over 500 school visits in the last four years to encourage pupils to recognise how much Scots language they know and use; deplores the status of the Scots tongue whereby few pupils when asked can name their own language as Scots, Doric or Lallans and not slang, and encourages the Scottish Arts Council and its successor body to continue the important funding of Itchy Coo and its work to promote Scots and, additionally, to encourage the recognition and use of Scots in public as well as private life by official bodies so that they prepare voluntarily Scots language development plans alongside the Gaelic language plans they have to prepare under the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4939</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Adult Obesity Highest in Europe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, according to government data released on 10 October 2006, some 24% of people in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are obese, compared with 8% in Italy, 9% in France and about 12% in Ireland, Germany and Spain; is concerned that obesity costs the NHS about &pound;170 million per annum and that a &quot;north-south divide&quot; persists with regard to obesity; believes that the Campaign For Free School Meals and the encouragement of better diets in general play a vital part in combating obesity, and further believes that less talk and more action by the Scottish Executive is needed to reduce the obesity statistics in Scotland.</p>
