<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;
  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../..//business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>S2M-5249</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Strategic Approach to Race Equality</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that racial inequalities and discrimination are iniquitous and hamper the development of nations; believes that a more strategic approach to promoting race equality is necessary if we are to achieve the vision of a fair and equal Scotland where everyone can maximise their potential; considers that we require a more accurate and up-to-date measure of Scotland&rsquo;s ethnic diversity and improved ethnicity data in order to inform planning and policy-making and to track progress towards achieving race equality; believes that the forthcoming race equality strategy and action plan should include ambitious targets, and, given the positive impact that equality in the labour market can have, not only on individuals but on businesses, communities and overall economic growth, believes that equality and diversity are valid measures of economic progress.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5246</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson on behalf of the Justice 2 Committee:</strong> <strong>Civil Appeals (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament does not agree to the general principles of the Civil Appeals (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5245</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Rendition Flights Inquiry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the preliminary report of Claudio Fava, Rapporteur to the European Parliament&rsquo;s temporary committee investigating CIA activity in Europe, has found that EU member states, including the United Kingdom, have failed to fully co-operate with his investigation, failed to carry out independent investigations of their own and failed to hold their own security services to account for their role in facilitating renditions; agrees with Amnesty International&rsquo;s conclusion that the report is a damning indictment of the UK&rsquo;s complicity in CIA renditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to stop ignoring the issue and to set in train a full, independent investigation into all aspects of rendition involving Scottish airports.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5244</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Subversion of Democracy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the undemocratic and underhand gerrymandering attempts of the Labour Party to subvert the democratic system of single transferable vote (STV) for local government elections; acknowledges that attempts to manipulate party names into blocks on the ballot paper would undermine the basic democratic principles of STV; recognises that this manipulation on the part of the Labour Party is a cynical electoral ploy to subvert the democratic process of the election and is due to the falling support for Labour councillors in local government, and therefore rejects utterly this underhand attempt to subvert the basic principles of democracy.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>S2M-5243</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with Civil Service PCS Members</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the government continues to drive down pay in the civil service while pursuing an ideologically driven policy of job cuts, outsourcing and privatisation which undermines the job security of civil service staff and wishes to express its support for, and solidarity with, PCS trade union members currently being balloted on a national civil service strike in resistance to these policies.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5242</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Obscene Profiteering by Scottish Power Shareholders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, as ordinary people across Scotland are struggling to meet increased gas and electricity prices, shareholders of Scottish Power, which increased gas and electricity prices by 15% and 8%, are being handsomely rewarded as a result of the &pound;11.6 billion takeover bid from Spanish company Iberdrola, and that, with Scottish Power&rsquo;s pre-tax profits soaring to &pound;1875.8 million, its shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank, and believes that the only alternative to the greater and greater monopoly of world energy resources being concentrated into the hands of fewer and fewer global companies is to return gas and electricity companies to public ownership, giving the power to government to control energy prices for low-income families and ending the orgy of greed and obscene profiteering by shareholders which is now being witnessed.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5241</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> <strong>Launch of the White Ribbon Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the setting-up of the White Ribbon Scotland Campaign; commends Amnesty International and the Men&rsquo;s Health Forum Scotland for launching this campaign; urges men in Scotland to get involved in campaigning to end violence against women; sees violence against women as a human rights abuse and an issue for all of society to tackle, and believes that the terms of discourse need to be changed so that violence against women is no longer seen as a &quot;women&rsquo;s issue&quot; but as an issue for all society.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5235&diams; </strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Scottish Power Takeover</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should issue a statement setting out its position in response to Iberdrola&rsquo;s proposed takeover of Scottish Power; expresses concern that Scotland&rsquo;s fourth-largest company may pass into foreign ownership without real debate about the effect this will have on jobs at the Glasgow headquarters, energy prices and the Scottish economy, and therefore believes that a Parliamentary debate on the issue should take place at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5234</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>NHS QIS - Clinical Standards for COPD Now - Don&rsquo;t Delay Until 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the recent statement by Dr David R Steel, Chief Executive of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) at its board meeting on 26 October 2006 that a commitment to clinical standards for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Scotland will not be forthcoming until after Audit Scotland reports back on its study of management of adults with long-term conditions including COPD, which is not due until May 2007 and also until the Department of Health&rsquo;s National Service Framework for England is published in May 2008; notes that NHS QIS is a Scottish body, initially formed through the amalgamation of a number of organisations that worked on improving the quality of healthcare in Scotland: the Clinical Resource and Audit Group, the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland, the Health Technology Board for Scotland, the Nursing and Midwifery Practice Development Unit and the Scottish Health Advisory Service; therefore calls on NHS QIS to develop clinical standards for COPD as soon as possible, thus ensuring its independent status and determining its own work  programme which takes full account of NHS Scotland&rsquo;s priorities; notes that one person dies of COPD every two hours, that it is the third most common reason for an acute hospital admission and that it costs NHS Scotland an estimated &pound;138 million a year; notes that these are dreadful indicators that something must be done urgently to set clinical standards and should not wait until after 2008 as recommended by NHS QIS, and calls on NHS QIS to reconsider implementing a commitment to clinical standards for COPD at its next board meeting on 14 December 2006.</p>
