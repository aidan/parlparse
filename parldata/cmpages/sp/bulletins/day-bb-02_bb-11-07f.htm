Grahame: The First Police Force</STRONG>-That the Parliament notes that established, 
co-ordinated and paid police forces were first established in Scotland from 1800 
onwards, some 29 years before the Peelers in London; further notes that in 1800 
a Bill was promoted by Glasgow Town Council seeking powers to establish a regular 
police force in the city that, once enacted, led to a parade of the Glasgow Police 
Force for duty in the Laigh Kirk Session house; notes that police forces followed 
in Edinburgh in 1805, Paisley in 1806, Greenock in 1810, Aberdeen 1818 and Dundee 
in 1824; notes that John Graham, a Glasgow merchant, became the first Superintendent 
of Police in 1862 and that, contrary to British history books, therefore, Sir 
Robert Peel in London was not the founder of modern policing, and urges the Scottish 
Parliamentary Corporate Body to commemorate this fact and the loss of many police 
officers' lives in the line of duty over these centuries in a suitable manner 
in the new Scottish Parliament building.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3555</STRONG> <STRONG>Michael 
Russell: The "Scottish Six" and the Prime Minister</STRONG>-That the Parliament 
notes with astonishment the remarks of the former director-general of the BBC, 
Mr John Birt, in the <em>Sunday Herald</em> on 20 October 2002 that he conspired 
with the Prime Minister in 1998 in order to stop the development of a "Scottish 
Six" main evening BBC television news bulletin, produced and edited in Scotland 
rather than in London, that he did so because he feared that it would lead to 
&quot;the collapse of the union&quot; and that according to him the Prime Minister 
&quot;was quick, as ever, to grasp the case, 'Let's fight,' he said&quot;; further 
notes Mr Birt's words that a &quot;plan of action&quot; was agreed to stop the 
"Scottish Six", involving senior BBC personnel, Gordon Brown MP and Peter Mandelson 
MP amongst others; believes that such a conspiracy fatally undermines the BBC's 
status as an &quot;independent corporation&quot;, as set out in the Corporation's 
Royal Charter; welcomes the assurance of the BBC's current director-general, Mr 
Greg Dyke, that the issues of a "Scottish Six" in the forthcoming BBC review of 
news and current affairs output in Scotland &quot;will be considered on their 
editorial, not their political merits&quot;, and believes that the conclusive 
broadcasting arguments in favour of a "Scottish Six" are reflected in the fact 
that it is supported by the Broadcasting Council for Scotland, BBC Scotland management 
and journalists and 69% of the Scottish people.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3554</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Andrew Wilson: Accounts Commission Report on Trading Standards Departments</STRONG>-That 
the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Accounts Commission of <em>Made 
to measure? An overview of trading standards in Scotland</em>, which assesses the 
performance of the 32 trading standards departments across Scotland; notes that 
this valuable and socially important service spends £19 million each year on providing 
regulatory and enforcement services to the business community and advice to consumers 
in Scotland; expresses its concern, however, at some of the findings of the report 
that suggest that there are "wide variations" in the levels of services delivered 
to consumers and businesses across Scotland with at least one quarter of trading 
standards departments not meeting the minimum standards of service they are required 
to meet; further notes the wide variations in the designation of premises liable 
for inspection by trading standards services which suggests "that similar types 
of premises are being under- or over-inspected, resulting in available resources 
not being used to best effect and traders not being treated consistently", and 
calls on the Scottish Executive to take action to ensure greater consistency in 
enforcement activity by trading standards services across Scotland consistent 
with best practice, as manifested in the enforcement concordat, in the interests 
of both consumers and the business community.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3553</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Education Standards in Cuba</STRONG>-That the Parliament 
notes the comments of a Wiltshire County Council spokeswoman in relation to primary 
school education in Cuba when she said &quot;Cuba has a 97% literacy rate which 
is better than ours in many areas of the country&quot;; further notes the result 
of research by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which found Cuba to be a &quot;beacon 
of education best practice&quot;, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive 
to arrange a fact-finding visit similar to that currently under way by 10 teachers 
from across Wiltshire County Council, paid for by the British Council Teachers' 
International Professional Development Programme, to exchange ideas and learn 
from the positive education experience promoted in Cuba.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3543.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tricia Marwick: Quality of Life</STRONG>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3543) 
in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, insert at end &quot;, but notes COSLA's concerns 
over the funding of core services.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3543.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr 
Keith Harding: Quality of Life</STRONG>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3543) in 
the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;notably&quot; to end and insert 
&quot;but regrets that measures being taken are likely to prove ineffective unless 
a much more robust approach is taken to issues of disorder, vandalism and violence 
which afflict far too many of them.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3543.3</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy 
Sheridan: Quality of Life</STRONG>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3543) in the 
name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes 
that the quality of life in Scotland's communities would be best improved by abolishing 
the regressive council tax and introducing a Scottish Service Tax, which would 
redistribute income to the less well-off and fund local services more effectively.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3542 
British Energy Finances</STRONG> (lodged on 5 November 2002) Tommy Sheridan<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3541.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Alex Fergusson: Forestry in Scotland</STRONG>-As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3541) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from 
&quot;and believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;but condemns the Scottish Executive's 
failure to address the practical problems which face the Scottish forestry industry, 
particularly with regard to transport; further notes that the Executive has failed 
to set and promote robust planting targets or to plan for the impending doubling 
of timber output over the next 10 to 15 years, and urges the Executive to give 
greater priority to the issues which so concern what is now the third biggest 
industry in Scotland.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3541.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Fergus 
Ewing: Forestry in Scotland</STRONG>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3541) in the 
name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;but 
believes that the Scottish Executive has failed to acknowledge the significant 
contribution to the Scottish economy of the timber and forest products industry 
and, in particular, in respect of the existing devolved functions of the Executive, 
further believes that it has failed to recognise the importance of the urgent 
need to improve the road network used for forestry extraction, of an effective 
policy of procurement to encourage the Scottish national industry interest, of 
effective promotion of biomass to assist in the achievement of more economic means 
of supplying energy from renewable sources and of the encouragement and active 
promotion of the use of wood as a building material.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3540#
