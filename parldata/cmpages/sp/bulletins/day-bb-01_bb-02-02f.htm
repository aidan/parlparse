            <strong>Irene McGugan: Robert Fergusson</strong>—That the Parliament recognises 
            the significant contribution of the 18<sup>th</sup> century poet Robert 
            Fergusson to Scotland’s literary heritage; notes that he continued 
            the revival of writing in the tongue of Lowland Scotland, which Allan 
            Ramsay (1684-1758) began in the years following the Treaty of Union; 
            notes that this revival in turn was taken up by Robert Burns, who 
            had all but given up writing poetry until he read Fergusson’s work 
            and found it inspirational and that in 1768, after his visit to Edinburgh, 
            Burns commissioned a headstone for Fergusson’s hitherto unmarked grave 
            in Canongate Kirkyard, a material symbol of his gratitude to the young 
            makar; further notes that later Robert Louis Stevenson gave instructions 
            that the stone should be repaired and re-inscribed because of the 
            debt he also felt he owed to Fergusson, and commends the &quot;Friends 
            of Robert Fergusson&quot; for their efforts to raise funds for the 
            erection of a &quot;people friendly&quot; statue in Edinburgh’s Royal 
            Mile to commemorate this poet whose importance to Scottish literature, 
            and particularly to poetry in Scots, cannot be overstated.</font></p>

            <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Deprivation in Rural Areas</strong>—That the Parliament 
            recognises the problems faced by Scotland’s rural communities as highlighted 
            by the Rural Development Committee in its report <i>The Impact of 
            Changing Employment</i> <i>Patterns in Rural Scotland</i>; acknowledges 
            that work is already under way to address these rural concerns; welcomes 
            the recent measures by the Scottish Executive to combat poverty and 
            deprivation in the Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley area by the increase 
            in funding for the East Ayrshire Coalfield Area and Girvan Social 
            Inclusion Partnerships; notes that further work requires to be done 
            to create sustainable jobs in the area, and urges the Executive to 
            continue working towards the elimination of poverty and deprivation 
            in all of Scotland’s rural communities.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Criminal Justice and Police Bill</strong>—That the Parliament 
            notes the provisions on information disclosure for criminal proceedings 
            and powers of seizure contained in Parts II and III of the Criminal 
            Justice and Police Bill currently before the UK Parliament; recognises 
            the practical value of consistency across the United Kingdom for information 
            disclosure for criminal investigation, and for powers of seizure as 
            they relate to certain United Kingdom bodies and local authority officials, 
            and agrees that the relevant provisions to achieve this end in this 
            Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament; further notes that 
            the Bill allows certain warrants issued in England and Wales to be 
            executed in Scotland, recognises the importance of mutual execution 
            of warrants for law enforcement, and agrees that the relevant provision 
            to achieve this end in this Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament.</font></p>

            the Scottish Executive should take forward the lessons of the Millennium 
            Project 2000 which taught the basics of British Sign Language (BSL) 
            and Deaf Awareness to schoolchildren; invites the Scottish Executive 
            to investigate the introduction of BSL to the school curriculum; and 
            further believes that Her Majesty’s Government should give official 
            recognition to BSL under the terms of the European Charter on Minority

            aphasia, the loss of the use of language as a result of a stroke or 
            head injury; recognises that a better understanding of this condition 
            is needed at all levels; calls for more research on aphasia, and urges 
            the Scottish Executive to provide guidance to all health boards in
