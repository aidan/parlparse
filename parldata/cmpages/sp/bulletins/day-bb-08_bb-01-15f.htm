<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1131</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>OECD Report into Scottish Education: the Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&rsquo;s (OECD) <em>Reviews of Policies for National Education: Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland</em> and its findings; notes the many positive aspects of our school education system highlighted by the OECD, and agrees that this report is an invaluable international evidence base on which to debate and develop Scotland&rsquo;s educational polices for the future, recognising the significant challenges identified by the OECD.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1130</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Environmental Protection (Transfers at Sea) Bill 2007-08</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with interest the Private Members&rsquo; Bill, proposed by Mark Lazarowicz MP at Westminster; congratulates Mr Lazarowicz on raising this issue and obtaining cross-party support for the proposal; observes that the regulations proposed by this Bill are those called for by many MSPs during the Parliament&rsquo;s debate on the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Amendment (No. 2) (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (SSI 2007/80) on 28 June 2007, and calls on as many MPs as possible, as well as the UK Government, to support this Bill.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1129</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Sixth Anniversary of Detention Camp at Guantanamo Bay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 11 January 2008 marked the sixth anniversary of the opening of the detention camp at the Guantanamo Bay site in Cuba by the United States authorities; notes that Amnesty International organised a peaceful protest outside the US consulate in Edinburgh on that date to mark this anniversary; notes that Amnesty International organised a collection of signatures of 1,200 parliamentarians across the world who believe that this camp should be closed and that the 53 members of the Scottish Parliament among that number represent the highest proportion of any Parliament in the world; believes that the camp at Guantanamo Bay represents a fundamental breach of the human rights and civil liberties of the hundreds of detainees held there without charge or attempt to bring them to trial; further believes that this breach of human rights and civil liberties gives lie to the pretence that the so-called &quot;war on terror&quot; is about protecting human rights and civil liberties and means that the US Government is in violation of established international law; congratulates Amnesty International for its efforts at raising awareness about these issues, and calls on the US Government to shut down the detention camp at the Guantanamo Bay site with immediate effect.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1128</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Car Parking at the Vale of Leven Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde decided in July 2007 to impose car parking charges in hospitals across its area; further notes the conclusions of the review group established by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to investigate the effect of the car park charging policy; considers that all management options should be exhausted before moving from providing free car parking; acknowledges that one of the stated reasons for introducing car parking charges is to discourage commuters who use hospital car parks but do not attend the hospital; nevertheless strongly believes that the Vale of Leven Hospital should be exempt from car parking charges because it is not affected by this problem of commuters using car parking inappropriately; recognises that car parking charges would be an unfair burden on low-paid staff, patients and visitors alike, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to exempt the Vale of Leven Hospital from the car parking charges scheme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1127</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Disappointment at Royal Mail&rsquo;s Stamps Refusal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its disappointment that the Royal Mail has decided not to issue short notice commemorative stamps to celebrate the achievement of Glasgow winning the bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games; believes that this would have been a fitting tribute to all those involved in the successful bid; asks the Royal Mail to reconsider its decision; notes that the Royal Mail considers special stamps for 2014, the year of the Commonwealth Games itself, as potentially interesting and that this has been included on the 2014 advance list with a decision to be taken in late 2012, and urges the Royal Mail to ensure that special stamps are issued for Glasgow&rsquo;s 2014 Commonwealth Games.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1126</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Deprivation and Health</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the relationship between deprivation and poor health is acknowledged by many bodies, including ASH Scotland, Have a Heart Paisley, NHS Scotland, the British Heart Foundation and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; deplores the level of poverty in the United Kingdom despite its high GDP as noted, for example, by motions S3M-60, S3M-724, S3M-995<strong>, </strong>S3M-1005 and S3M-1094; is of the opinion that unless significant progress is made in reducing wealth inequalities then strategies to reduce health inequalities will have limited impact; believes, therefore, that a failure to significantly reduce wealth inequalities can only have three possible explanations: incompetence, ignorance of the relationship between deprivation and health, or the deliberate condemnation of many thousands of people to premature death, and, in light of the foregoing, urges the UK Government urgently to reassess its priorities and specifically to reconsider the use to which it puts oil revenues, its planned expenditure on nuclear weaponry and identity cards and its policy on tax loopholes for the super-rich.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1125</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Keeping Health Services Local</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is dismayed at the decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to transfer emergency medical services from the Vale of Leven Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; considers that the board has ignored the views of the local community, local clinicians and the Independent Scrutiny Panel, led by Professor Mackay; further believes that the board&rsquo;s attempts to usurp the consultation process with the immediate transfer of services ride roughshod over any public engagement; notes that the final decision on service change lies with the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that health services, including the medical assessment unit, are maintained locally.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1124</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Death of Sir Edmund Hillary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Sir Edmund Hillary; remembers his pioneering achievement as being the first man to climb to the summit of Mount Everest alongside Tenzing Norgay on 29 May 1953; notes that this ascent, and other expeditions in Nepal and to the South Pole, have inspired many generations of mountaineers, including many Scots; further notes Sir Edmund&rsquo;s work with the ethnic Sherpas of Nepal and his Himalayan Trust which has helped build infrastructure in Nepal, and, while sending condolences to his family, expresses a hope that this mountaineering legend will continue to inspire people throughout the world for many years to come.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1093</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Energy Sector Social Tariffs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the rise in cost of wholesale supplies to the energy market will result in large increases in domestic prices, which will place an unacceptable burden on the poorest and most vulnerable members of society, and believes that the forthcoming UK Energy Bill should include provision to commit energy companies to introducing social tariffs to protect people who are concerned that they will be unable to heat their homes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1093.1</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Energy Sector Social Tariffs</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1093) in the name of Sandra White, insert at end &quot;regrets that the commitment made by the Minister for Communities and Sport to meet Scottish Power to end the practice of backcharging of prepayment meter customers in Scotland has not had any effect; notes that Scottish Power has ended backcharging for customers in other areas of the United Kingdom; considers this to be unfair to Scottish customers who are vulnerable and continue to be in debt through no fault of their own, and calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent steps to urge Scottish Power to think again.&quot;</p>
