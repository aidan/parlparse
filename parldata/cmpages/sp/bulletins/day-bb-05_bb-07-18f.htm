That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-3102</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Human Rights in Western Sahara</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern recent reports of demonstrations and arrests in the occupied territory of the Western Sahara, while noting with particular concern credible reports of disappearances and torture of Saharawi students, activists and human rights workers by Moroccan security forces; condemns these actions by Morocco and calls on the Scottish Executive to do likewise; calls on MINURSO to investigate and report on the recent turmoil and to reinvigorate efforts to find a solution to the Western Sahara dispute, and further calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government, under the United Kingdom&rsquo;s responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to propose at the UN Security Council a deadline for Morocco to accept the Baker Plan, which was fully endorsed by the Security Council in 2003 under resolution 1495 (2003) and has since been rejected by Morocco. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-3101</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Way Out West</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the achievement of young people from West Dunbartonshire&rsquo;s high schools who participated in song writing workshops resulting in the production of &ldquo;Way out West&rdquo;; notes that funding for the project came from a number of agencies including West Dunbartonshire Community Safety Partnership as part of the Local Action Fund; believes that, given the necessary resources, the energies of young people can be positively directed and enhance their local communities, and supports continued investment in youth services and programmes provided by the Scottish Executive in such forms as local action funds. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-3100</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: The Red Cross in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the sterling contribution by the Red Cross acting under its seven founding principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality, both abroad and here in Scotland where it provides services in key areas such as emergency response and assisting the vulnerable; notes that in 2004 and, in particular, on 11 May 2004 with the explosion at the plastics factory at Maryhill, Glasgow, its volunteers assisted at the site for 70 hours following the explosion with other agencies, dealing with very distressed people, comforting relatives and treating minor injuries; further notes that its medical loan service provided equipment such as wheelchairs and walking frames to some 6,500 people and that its transport and escort service made nearly 30,000 journeys in 2004; applauds its network of 4,500 volunteers Scotland-wide and its 350 staff, and, in these challenging times, is mindful that it is a member of the International Red Cross Movement and Red Crescent Movement in which all societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other worldwide. </p>
