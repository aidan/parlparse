<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4922</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Equal Pay not Lower Pay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses profound concern that the Scottish Executive has included no plans in its draft budget to assist local authorities to meet their obligations in respect of single status and equal pay; is appalled that Falkirk Council has issued a 90-day notice to its staff to impose changes and detriment to their terms and conditions by making them redundant on 17 December 2006 and re-engaging them on 18 December in opposition to, and over the heads of, the trade unions and their members; believes that the council should withdraw its 90-day notice and join the trade unions to demand that the Executive pays up to meet its existing duty to do all it can to achieve equal pay; believes that equal pay should be achieved by levelling up, not down; acknowledges that women have struggled to achieve as much pay as men, not for men to be paid as little as them, and calls on the Executive to amend its budget proposals to include plans and resources that will deliver equal pay in conjunction with local authorities and with the agreement of trade unions and their members.</p>
<p>Supported by: Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4921</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4920</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Scottish Commissioner for Human Rights Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Scottish Commissioner for Human Rights Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson<strong>*</strong>, Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4919</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Tourist Boards (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Tourist Boards (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4918</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Youth Hostels Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Youth Hostels Association on continuing to play an important role in the tourism economy of Scotland; notes the improvement in its financial position for 2005 as well as the increase in the number of people using its facilities; further notes the ongoing development of use of facilities for programmes involving children from disadvantaged backgrounds as well as partnerships with organisations such as the National Trust for Scotland, the Forestry Commission, the Mountain Bothies Association, the Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award Scheme, the Girl Guides and the Boys&rsquo; Brigade, and wishes the association well as it develops its facilities in rural areas, cities and towns across Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4901.1</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Duty to its Senior Citizens</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4901) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;is therefore&quot; to end and insert &quot;and that the Scottish Executive should immediately take action to increase the income of every pensioner household in Scotland in a legal manner which is entirely compliant with the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 and thereby follow up on that excellent social experiment by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown MP, in 2005 which should result in the first drop in winter-related deaths in Scotland in recent years.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4901.2</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Duty to its Senior Citizens</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4901) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;and that they&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that Scotland&rsquo;s primary duty to its senior citizens is to lift them out of the poverty and deprivation that so many endure and that the effect of Conservative policies of the 1980s and 1990s, in particular the introduction of the hated council tax and the abandonment of the link between pensions increases and the increase in average earnings, has meant that their standard of living has significantly fallen; therefore calls for the abolition of the council tax, under which many pensioners pay up to 25% of their overall income on one bill, and its replacement with a system based on ability to pay, where the poor and low-paid are exempt and the tax obligation increases as income increases, and further believes that the restoration of the link between average earnings and pensions would ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s senior citizens do not continue to fall behind the rest of the population and secure the right to live in dignity in retirement.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4901.3</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Duty to its Senior Citizens</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4901) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;is therefore&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses concern, therefore, that free personal care is not being delivered equitably, with waiting lists being operated in some regions, and believes that the Scottish Executive must take immediate action to eradicate these practices; also believes that pensioner poverty cannot be tackled without the abolition of the council tax and its substitution by the fairer system of a local income tax; is alarmed at the devastating fuel cost increases which must lead to increasing vulnerability of our older people to cold-related illnesses and early mortality, and, while welcoming legislation to end age discrimination, calls on the Executive to inquiry into elder abuse.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4901.4</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Duty to its Senior Citizens</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4901) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from first &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the enormous contribution that our senior citizens make to Scottish society; supports action to challenge ageism, widen opportunities for older people and ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect; acknowledges the improvement to older people&rsquo;s quality of life through groundbreaking policies such as free personal and nursing care, free bus travel and the central heating programme, and welcomes the continuing commitment of the Scottish Executive to recognising, valuing and supporting Scotland&rsquo;s older people through the development of its Strategy for a Scotland with an Ageing Population.&quot;</p>
