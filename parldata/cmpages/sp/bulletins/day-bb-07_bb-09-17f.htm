          <p><strong>*S3M-483&diams; </strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Time for a Fresh Debate on Organ Donation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the ongoing work that British Medical Association Scotland is doing to raise awareness of organ donation; recognises that the number of people on the active and temporarily suspended transplant waiting list in Scotland rose by almost 20% from 695 in September 2005 to its highest level of 818 in July 2007 and yet only 50 organs were donated in Scotland last year and that at 10 June 2007 there were 135 people in the NHS Lothian area registered with UK Transplant as waiting for an organ; recognises that the current opt-in system of organ donation is unable to meet the increasing demands placed upon it; acknowledges the need for a full and proper public debate to establish the level of support that exists for a move to a system of presumed consent that will both inform future proposals in this area and raise awareness of the desperate need for organ donors, and considers that moves to turn the tremendous level of public and, increasingly, professional support that exists for organ donation into something meaningful should be supported by implementing a system of presumed consent.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-374#</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>ICL Factory Explosion - Call For Public Inquiry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, three years and three months after the factory explosion that claimed the lives of nine workers, badly injured many more and devastated the community of Maryhill, the companies involved, ICL Plastics and ICL Tech Limited, have pled guilty to breaches of health and safety legislation; recognises the dignified and responsible way in which the families of those involved in this tragedy have conducted themselves throughout this difficult time; notes the support and assistance given by the STUC and the families&rsquo; lawyers throughout, and further notes the call by the families and their supporters for a wide-reaching public inquiry into the circumstances of this case and looks to the Lord Advocate to facilitate such an inquiry.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-97#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Beauly Denny Public Inquiry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the conduct of the public inquiry into the proposed Beauly to Denny 400kV electricity transmission line; notes that there is a lack of confidence from many objectors in the current handling of the inquiry and that objectors have raised concerns with Inquiry Reporters but that these concerns have been dismissed; further notes with concern that many objectors&rsquo; submissions have been ruled inadmissible; believes that serious issues are not being fully considered due to the strict adherence to the inquiry timetable, and further believes that the current conduct of the public inquiry will prevent a fully democratic inquiry and does nothing to reassure the 17,000 objectors that this is a fair process.</p>
