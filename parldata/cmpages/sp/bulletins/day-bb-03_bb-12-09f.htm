          <p><strong>*S2M-715</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Fisheries 
            2004</strong>-That the Parliament supports the Scottish Executive 
            in its efforts to negotiate the best possible outcome from the EU 
            Fisheries Council in December 2003 that delivers sustainable fisheries 
            management, sustainable fisheries and sustainable fishing businesses 
            based on total allowable catches and effort controls that are both 
            fair and effective.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-714</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Australian 
            Government's Treatment of Refugees</strong>-That the Parliament condemns 
            the actions of the Australian government in refusing to grant sanctuary 
            to refugees arriving there and in jeopardising the lives of such refugees 
            by preventing them from reaching Australia, forcibly removing them, 
            detaining them in prisons for indefinite periods of time and failing 
            to grant residence when their refugee status has been recognised.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-713#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Sustainability 
            in Higher Education</strong>-That the Parliament, on the occasion 
            of the conference on sense and sustainability in Scottish higher education, 
            organised by the Higher Education Partnership for Sustainability in 
            Scotland (HEPS), commends the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council 
            (SHEFC) on its promotion of sustainable development in the sector, 
            including its support for HEPS, led by University of Aberdeen, Heriot 
            Watt University, University of St. Andrews and University of Stirling 
            and their support for the Scottish Universities' Network for Sustainability 
            comprising the University of Aberdeen, University of Abertay Dundee, 
            Bell College, University of Dundee, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh 
            College of Art, University of Glasgow, Glasgow Caledonian University, 
            Glasgow College of Art, Heriot Watt University, Napier University, 
            Open University in Scotland, University of Paisley, Queen Margaret 
            University College, The Robert Gordon University, Royal Scottish Academy 
            of Music and Drama, University of St Andrews, University of Stirling, 
            University of Strathclyde; also commends the UHI Millennium Institute 
            and Forum for the Future for their contribution; further commends 
            these organisations and universities for their pro-active agenda and 
            the progress they have made so far in mainstreaming sustainability 
            good practice into the management, research, and curriculum of the 
            higher education sector; recognises the importance of these developments 
            for the economy, environment, and future of Scotland, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should request SHEFC, the Scottish Further 
            Education Funding Council and Scottish Enterprise to require sustainability 
            reporting and monitoring as a condition for funding and grant aid.</P>
