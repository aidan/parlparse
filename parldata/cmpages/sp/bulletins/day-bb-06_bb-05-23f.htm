<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4434#</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle:</strong> <strong>Fife&rsquo;s Coastline</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that Fife has some of the most beautiful coastline in Scotland; further recognises that the Scottish Executive has made efforts to clean up our coasts and seas, particularly through the Scottish Coastal Forum; recognises that the local tourism industry depends on Fife having clean beaches and seas; understands that there is much work still to be done and that some of our coastline is still littered with rubbish and other pollution, and considers that the Executive and other relevant public agencies should redouble their efforts in cleaning up the coastline and seas for our own quality of life, for tourism, for wildlife and for future generations.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4433</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Montenegro</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the people of Montenegro on voting for independence in their recent referendum; notes that Montenegro can now take its place among the other nations of the world as a sovereign state able to determine its own destiny free from interference and able to drive social and economic policies tailored to Montenegrins, and notes that Montenegro has successfully managed to re-establish its independence through peaceful and democratic means and that such democratic independence movements are an inspiration to all those who wish to see their own nation reclaim its independence and freedom.</p>
<p>Supported by: Brian Adam<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4432</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Local Food is Miles Better</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the tonnage of food air freighted around the world has risen by 140% since 1992 and that, although air transport only accounts for 1% of food miles, 11% of food miles&rsquo; carbon dioxide emissions are down to air transport; further notes that there has been a 23% rise in food transported by HGV since 1978 and that the average distance travelled has increased by 50%, and supports <em>Farmers Weekly&rsquo;s </em>Local Food Is Miles Better campaign, which aims to cut food miles and pollution and to support local food producers.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4431</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Independence for Montenegro</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its warmest congratulations to the people of Montenegro for voting to secede from Serbia and recognises that independence is the most normal state of affairs in every corner of our world.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4430</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Academic Pay Dispute</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the important contribution of Scotland&rsquo;s universities to the nation&rsquo;s economy and well-being; deplores the unnecessary delays caused by the university principals&rsquo; and vice-chancellors&rsquo; prolonged refusal to negotiate in respect of academic pay; reminds them that the recent increase of funding was partly granted in expectation that they were about to restore some of the lost value of academic pay, and urges them to seek a just settlement with great urgency in order to prevent further damage to students about to graduate and to ensure the future quality of teaching and research.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4429</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Action on Ticket Touting</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign initiated by DF Concerts to prohibit the unauthorised resale of tickets for concerts and events; notes that ticket touting is extremely prevalent and that many unofficial outlets are guilty of huge mark-ups on a ticket&rsquo;s face value, for example at events like T in the Park or major UK tours; condemns the exploitation of concert goers and music fans; notes that there is a particular effect upon young people who are often more likely to be persuaded into paying prices which they may not be able to afford; further notes the disgraceful actions of Get Me Tickets Ltd whose recent sale of non-existent tickets resulted in 200 young people being stranded outside a venue; supports the work of the Secretaries of State for Culture, Media and Sport and for Trade and Industry who aim to protect the public from this exploitation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to investigate how it can better support legitimate events promoters and work with the UK Government to protect Scotland&rsquo;s events and concert goers.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4428</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>The Energy Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the argument for new nuclear build in the United Kingdom has not been made; notes that, even with an accelerated planning system, new nuclear power stations could not contribute either to plugging the &quot;energy gap&quot; or to carbon reductions by 2020 when existing electricity generating capacity is run down and carbon emissions have to be curbed; further notes that existing Scottish electricity generation is provided 22% by gas, 26% by coal, 35% by nuclear and 13% by renewables but that around 17% of electricity generated in Scotland is exported; further notes that massive investment in new infrastructure across the UK is providing for a diversity of gas supply from many countries including Norway, with Russian gas only contributing around 1%, and that new clean coal technologies are now available; also notes that the supply of wind power is growing faster than predicted and that in Germany wind power capacity is already equivalent to UK nuclear capacity; further believes that new nuclear build would be inconsistent with environmental sustainability, adding to the legacy of highly toxic nuclear waste and the huge public cost of decommissioning and storage; urges the Scottish Executive to see the bigger picture in which electricity accounts for just 19% of total energy consumed in Scotland and carbon emissions by sector were last recorded as 17% transport, 11% domestic, 12% business and 37% energy supply, and further urges the Executive to recognise the enormous potential for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by energy efficiency and conservation, greater use of combined heat and power and rapid investment in the full range of renewable technologies, including microgeneration and biomass.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4427</strong> <strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Auchinleck Talbot</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Auchinleck Talbot on winning the OVD Scottish Junior Cup Final 2006; also encourages Bathgate Thistle as the runners-up who contributed to an excellent match, and believes that junior football has a strong role to play in encouraging the young people in our smaller Scottish towns to be physically active and involved in the local community.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4423#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Scottish Maritime Museum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of maintaining and promoting Scotland&rsquo;s maritime heritage; commends the work of the Scottish Maritime Museum in furthering this aim; notes that the Scottish Maritime Museum has premises in Irvine, Dumbarton and Braehead; recognises that the museum at Irvine Harbourside is currently home to the puffer Spartan and the SY Carola; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to the museum and, in particular, notes that the Executive has provided additional grant funding to allow the Irvine museum to maintain the collection for the last three financial years; notes that the Irvine museum, incorporating the Puffer coffee shop, attracted 25,248 visitors in 2005 and in the same year 701 educational group visits took place; commends the museum for its work in involving the local community of Irvine through organising events for North Ayrshire residents, such as the recent &quot;Show Scotland&quot; event which allowed 807 local people to visit the museum free of charge and the recently launched Fablevision project, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, which brings together disadvantaged young people from Irvine to research and document the history of the puffer Spartan, culminating in the production of a short film; notes that the museum has also been very active in providing opportunities for long-term unemployed people and that the museum currently has six unemployed New Deal placements; regrets that long-term funding for the museum has yet to be secured, thereby limiting the opportunities for the museum to access lottery and other funding opportunities; agrees that the Scottish Maritime Museum at Irvine makes a valuable contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s cultural heritage and to the North Ayrshire economy, and considers that long-term funding should be offered to secure its future.</p>
