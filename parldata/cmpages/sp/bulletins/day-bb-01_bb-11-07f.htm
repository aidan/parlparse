          <p> <strong>*S1M-2412</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Conduct of

            set out in the Report of the Consultative Steering Group and the Scottish 
            Ministerial Code which require Ministers to be as open as possible 
            with the Parliament and the public about their decisions and actions 
            and to be accountable for them to the Scottish people; regrets that 
            the First Minister has failed to observe the spirit of these principles 
            in respect of the misuse of public funds in relation to the use of 
            his Parliamentary constituency office in Glenrothes; views with profound 
            concern the belated disclosure of the financial transactions related 
            to said office involving receipt of rentals by Henry McLeish of £36,122 
            which sums were retained by him and not accounted for by him to the 
            Fees Office of the House of Commons; believes that said sum should 
            be paid back in full by the First Minister; deplores the lack of candour 
            and transparency exhibited by the First Minister in relation to this 
            matter, which has lost him the confidence of the people of Scotland, 
            and calls upon him to resign.</p>

            under its aegis or preferably as a distinct part of a full UK inquiry, 
            into the impact of, preparations for and handling of the foot-and-mouth

            in Regeneration and notes that Dundee was the only winning project 
            from Scotland; further congratulates the Dundee Partnership who were 
            involved in the work leading up to this award, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to build on this work through its review of the cities by 
            recognising the crucial role which Dundee plays in the Scottish economy 
            as a regional economic centre and by taking positive steps to assist 
            the city in combating the negative impact of de-population.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2407</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Alexander

            Alexander Stoddart of Paisley and, in particular, on the occasion 
            of Princeton University in the United States of America unveiling 
            his magnificent new statue of the Paisley minister, the Reverend John 
            Witherspoon, who became a founding father of the United States and 
            helped to frame the American Declaration of Independence; congratulates 
            Mr Stoddart on his dual Witherspoon statue now in Paisley and on his 
            other superb works which grace parts of Scotland; is grateful to Princeton 
            University, which started as a college with its most important early 
            presidency held by the Reverend Witherspoon, for its vision in helping 
            to support the best of sculpture from Scotland, and hopes that Scottish 
            organisations may show equal vision in commissioning great works from 
            exceptional artists who, like Mr Stoddart, strive to remain in Scotland.</p>

            in the Case of the Murder of Surjit Singh Chhokar</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
            to motion (S1M-2406) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, <a name="AmendmentText">insert 
            at end &quot;; but further notes the serious concerns raised by both 
            reports about the lack of resourcing of both the Crown Office and 
            the Procurator Fiscal Service and the effect that has had on their 
            ability to operate effectively; is concerned at the apparent confusion 
            regarding the definition and existence of institutional racism emerging 
            from the different conclusions of the two reports; deplores the personal 
            attacks on named individuals contained within the Jandoo Report which 
            seriously detracted from the important issues being investigated, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive to establish a full public inquiry 
            into the handling of the case, in order to restore public confidence 
            in our prosecution services.&quot;</a></p>
