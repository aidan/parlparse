<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the<a href="#end"> end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00162 Lewis Macdonald: Housing Adaptations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the withdrawal of recent guidance from the Scottish Government requiring housing providers, such as housing associations and co-operatives, to fund the first &pound;1,000 of every housing adaptation; notes with regret that this applies only to the current financial year, and calls on the Scottish Government to listen to concerns expressed by carers, to carry out a review and consultation on future funding of adaptations and to commit to fully funding adaptations pending the outcome of that review.</p>

<p>Supported by: Claudia Beamish, Humza Yousaf</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00158 Neil Findlay: Royal Regiment for Scotland Receives Freedom of West Lothian</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Regiment for Scotland on receiving the Freedom of West Lothian; commends the regiment for its bravery under trying circumstances, and respectfully notes its sacrifice under those difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>Supported by: Patricia Ferguson, Jackie Baillie, Claudia Beamish, John Park</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00155&#9830; Rob Gibson: Germany Exits Nuclear Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the German Government to take its nuclear power plants offline by 2022, thus joining Switzerland, which recently announced its intention to be nuclear free by 2034; considers that this implies the provision of electricity from more renewable sources and compliments the German Government on its ambition, and considers that the Scottish Government target of 100% electricity produced from renewable sources is entirely achievable and can help reindustrialise many parts of Scotland, including renewable energy hubs in Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00154 Mary Scanlon: Congratulations to the SSFRA</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Senior Football Referees&rsquo; Association (SSFRA) for raising &pound;8,370 for the Tartan Army Children&rsquo;s Charity at its first ever Scottish Cup Final Gala Dinner held to congratulate the team of referees appointed to the Scottish Cup Final and to present the referee, Calum Murray, with what is considered the prestigious Jack Mowat Trophy; notes that this event was attended by referees from every association in Scotland; welcomes the decision of the SSFRA to nominate the Tartan Army Children&rsquo;s Charity as its designated charity for the evening; further notes that the money raised will be used to allow Scottish children to attend their first Scotland match and receive a Scotland top and buy Christmas presents later in the year; praises all referees in Scotland who made this event a success, and wishes the often criticised men and women referees a successful 2011-12 season.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00153 Jackie Baillie: Finding Employment in West Dunbartonshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the recent report by the TUC indicating that West Dunbartonshire has the lowest success rate in the United Kingdom for finding employment; notes that the TUC looked at the proportion of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JSA) claimants to Jobcentre Plus vacancies in every local authority and that West Dunbartonshire came out worst with over 40 JSA claimants chasing every vacancy; understands that, when a similar survey was carried out in 2005, West Dunbartonshire was ranked 38th; considers that thisshows a marked decline in employment opportunities in the area; expresses further concern at the news that the Department of Work and Pensions has announced that it is closing its Clydebank call centre with the loss of 130 jobs; believes that this will further damage employment prospects in West Dunbartonshire; calls on the Department of Work and Pensions to reverse its decision, and urges the Scottish Government to take urgent action to address what it sees as the growing problem of unemployment in West Dunbartonshire.</p>
<p>Supported by: Patricia Ferguson, James Kelly, Neil Findlay, Mary Fee</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00152 Patrick Harvie: Prison Visiting Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent Scottish Government consultation on independent monitoring of prisons, which raised questions about the continued operation of prison visiting committees; recognises that a review of visiting committees took place as recently as 2005 and that recommendations at that time were for a continued role for visiting committees and a number of changes to improve their impact and consistency; considers that visiting committees have a valuable role in providing independent scrutiny of conditions in prisons and examining complaints and concerns raised about the treatment of prisoners; places particular value on the frequency of unannounced visits to prisons, which are not a feature of the inspection carried out by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Prisons; believes that the role of visiting committees should continue in a manner that complements the inspection regime, rather than being incorporated into it, and thanks the hundreds of visiting committee members for their thousands of hours of unpaid effort and for their commitment to their work.</p>
<p>Supported by: Tavish Scott</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00151&#9830; Jamie Hepburn: North Lanarkshire Car Parking Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed car parking charges by North Lanarkshire Council for various town centre locations and railway station park and ride sites; considers that these charges will have a negative effect on residents and businesses in locations such as Kilsyth town centre and across North Lanarkshire, as well as discouraging use of rail as a mode of transport from stations such as Croy, Cumbernauld and Greenfaulds and throughout the local authority area, and believes that the proposals, which have been approved by North Lanarkshire Council&rsquo;s Planning and Transportation Committee and are now out to public consultation, are ill-considered.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00150 Kevin Stewart: North Sea Oil Production Concerns</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its grave concerns regarding the findings of the report by the UK Department of Energy that there has been the biggest decrease in North Sea oil production since quarterly records began; understands that industry leaders and experts have continually warned that the recent tax increase on oil and gas production announced in the UK budget would threaten major projects; notes that Oil and Gas UK members suggest that 60 out of 240 potential projects have less of a chance of coming to fruition since the budget, and calls on the UK Government to urgently review its decision to increase the supplementary tax on North Sea oil production from 20% to 32%.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00149 Kevin Stewart: Stop North Sea Air Passenger Duty Extension</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the motion put forward by Aberdeen City Councillor Kate Dean and backed unanimously by the council&rsquo;s Enterprise, Planning and Infrastructure Committee, calling on the UK Government to exempt helicopter flights to and from North Sea installations from any possible extension of air passenger duty; understands that this proposal would create an extra &pound;180 million annual tax burden for the oil and gas industry and would have a major impact on jobs and investment, and calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to abandon any plans he has to implement what it considers this daft proposal.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00148 Patrick Harvie: Supporting Jubilee Scotland&rsquo;s Call for Debt Arbitration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern what it considers to be the current lack of adequate mechanisms for addressing crisis cases of sovereign debt; supports Jubilee Scotland&rsquo;s belief that arbitration should be encouraged as an effective method for resolving sovereign debt disputes and that, in particular, it should be promoted as a means of settling cases of unjust or unpayable poor country debt; is of the view that, under the Arbitration (Scotland) Act 2010, Scotland possesses a modern and robust framework in which parties can seek arbitration; believes that this framework can be applied to discussions of sovereign debt just as it can to commercial and consumer disputes, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government and Scotland&rsquo;s legal community to promote Scotland internationally as a seat of arbitration in such cases.</p>
<p>Supported by: Gil Paterson, Jackie Baillie, John Finnie, John Park</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00146 Bob Doris: Glasgow Wind Turbines Come out Top in USA</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow-based Gaia Wind Ltd, which has received the top A rating for its Gaia-Wind 133-11kW turbine product in what is considered the prestigious HomePower survey in the USA; notes that Gaia-Wind beat off stiff competition from the other top 24 comparable turbines available in the US market to be voted number one; believes, following the company&rsquo;s recent &pound;5 million investment in its Port Dundas site in Glasgow with the initial creation of 50 jobs, that Gaia-Wind is now in pole position to expand its share of the small-turbine market, bringing further jobs to the area, and wishes the company well with its ambitious expansion plans over the next few years.</p>
