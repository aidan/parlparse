          <p><strong>*S1M-2430</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Funding of Further 
            Education Colleges</strong>-That the Parliament notes the increasing 
            number of industrial disputes affecting Scotland's further education 
            colleges; believes that these disputes are overwhelmingly the result 
            of a flawed funding system arising from colleges being removed from 
            local authority control, thus compelling colleges to adopt aggressive 
            cuts packages in order to satisfy their banks at the expense of proper 
            further education provision; further believes that our further education 
            colleges are tremendous assets to the local communities they serve 
            and to Scotland as a whole, and, in recognition of their value to 
            Scotland, resolves to investigate the re-incorporation of Scotland's 
            colleges under local authority control with democratic and accountable 
            management to ensure secure, long-term funding dictated by educational 
            priorities and not commercial concerns.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2429</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan: Future of Air 
            Links to Brussels</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the news that Sabena has filed for bankruptcy and the uncertainties 
            over direct flights from Scotland to Brussels; recognises the importance 
            of these links to Scotland's economic, cultural and political life, 
            and urges the Scottish Executive to work with Her Majesty's Government 
            to safeguard Scotland's links to the heart of Europe. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2428#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: 2002, Autism 
            Awareness Year</strong>-That the Parliament joins with the Scottish 
            Society for Autism, the National Autistic Society, Autism Alliance 
            Scotland, the Learning Disabilities Trust, the British Institute for 
            Brain Injured Children and all other autism organisations across Scotland 
            in declaring 2002 as Autism Awareness Year; recognises the everyday 
            challenges faced by children and adults on the autistic spectrum, 
            and their families, in gaining appropriate support from the statutory 
            services, and further recognises and congratulates those voluntary 
            organisations, including the East Renfrewshire Autism Support Group, 
            which work tirelessly to support all of those affected by autistic 
            spectrum disorders. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2427#</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: Maggie's 
            Cancer Centre Charity</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">recognises, 
            welcomes and supports the Maggie's Cancer Centre charity, founded 
            by Maggie Keswick Jencks in 1996, for its work in providing extra 
            medical care, support and assistance to cancer sufferers, their families 
            and friends and which seeks to ensure that cancer sufferers are as 
            healthy in mind and body as possible, by enabling them to participate 
            actively in the treatment of their disease and to share their experiences 
            with other sufferers; considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            actively promote the development of Maggie's Centres throughout Scotland, 
            and wishes the campaign to develop a Maggie's Centre in Kirkcaldy 
            every success.</a></p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2418#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Bicycle Helmets</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that the majority of deaths in cycling accidents 
            occur as a result of head injuries; recognises that wearing a correctly 
            fitted helmet has been shown to reduce the risk of severe head injury 
            by 63 to 88%; further recognises that cost is a major barrier, particularly 
            for families on a low income, and therefore *believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should* promote a campaign of responsible cycling, including 
            dissemination of information on wearing helmets correctly and measures 
            to reduce the cost of bicycle helmets to the public.</p>
