          <p><strong>*S1M-3044#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie: Westfield Development 
            Proposals</strong>-That the Parliament applauds the Scottish Executive's 
            determination to produce an effective and sustainable National Waste 
            Strategy and the First Minister's support for &quot;environmental 
            justice&quot; principles; notes that environmental justice principles 
            were promoted by Dr Robert Bullard following a study of waste disposal 
            in the USA; considers that Dr Bullard's conclusions highlighted the 
            fact that the poorest areas of a nation carried the major burden of 
            &quot;toxic pollution&quot;; further notes that, in any implementation 
            plans for recycling and waste disposal, the poorest and most deprived 
            communities should not become &quot;dumping grounds&quot; for other 
            major areas of Scotland; expresses concern at potential health issues, 
            and regrets that current proposals for Fife's Westfield Recycling 
            initiative by Alba will have major adverse implications for the surrounding 
            towns and villages as a result of heavily increased road traffic pressurising 
            in an unacceptable way already over-committed local authority roads 
            budgets, further endangering numerous weak bridges scattered right 
            across Fife, adding new traffic volumes to an already severely congested 
            Forth Rail Bridge and causing unacceptably high levels of noise pollution 
            and diminished air quality and visual amenity to a countryside that 
            has the potential for a major green-field project similar to the widely 
            acclaimed land restoration project at Lochore Meadows, which has been 
            in place for more than 20 years and was a former major pit bing site.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3043</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: European Parliamentary 
            Report on Multi-Annual Guidance Programme for Fishing Fleets</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the SNP members of the European Parliament 
            and their European Free Alliance Colleagues on their successful amendment 
            in the European Parliament on 25 April 2002 to the parliamentary report 
            on multi-annual guidance programme for fishing fleets which instructs 
            the President of the European Parliament &quot;to forward its resolution 
            to the governments and parliaments in the Member States&quot;, ensuring 
            that the Scottish Parliament will be informed directly of this report; 
            notes that this sets a precedent for this Parliament to be informed 
            of further important deliberations in the European Parliament as of 
            right; further notes that the proposal was opposed by the Scottish 
            Labour MEP Catherine Stihler at the fisheries committee meeting in 
            March 2002, and welcomes the volte-face of Scottish Labour MEPs in 
            the plenary session. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3042</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Sexual Assaults</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the increase in the number of sexual assaults 
            carried out in 2001; welcomes the Lord Advocate's Review on the definition 
            of rape and the conclusion which it reached which now firmly places 
            rape law around consent; further notes the announcement by Harriet 
            Harman of the intention to introduce a national network of specialist 
            rape prosecutors in England and Wales, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to look at conducting an overarching review of the current procedures 
            set up to deal with sexual assault cases and of all legislation covering 
            sexual assault cases in Scotland in order to combat current trends 
            in sexual assault cases as changes should not be carried out in a 
            piecemeal manner.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3041#</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: Scottish Mining 
            Museum</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance of the 
            industrial museum sector and, with the closure of the last deep mine 
            in Scotland at Longannet, the crucial role played by the Scottish 
            Mining Museum at Newtongrange in preserving the heritage of former 
            coal mining communities.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3040</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Criminal Record 
            Checks for Students</strong>-That the Parliament supports the Association 
            of Scottish Colleges (ASC) in its condemnation of Scottish Executive 
            proposals to impose charges for criminal record checks for students; 
            notes that such checks would be in respect of courses involving work 
            placements with children and vulnerable adults; supports the view 
            that the charges will impact most negatively on students who are unemployed 
            or from disadvantaged backgrounds; recognises the ASC's concerns that 
            the inclusion of students in such a regime could lead to a decline 
            in the availability of people suitable and properly qualified for 
            working with children and vulnerable adults, and suggests that, in 
            order to avoid such a decline, the charges should remain, as they 
            are at present, free</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3039</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Taxation on 
            Oil and Gas Profits</strong>-That the Parliament notes the decision 
            by Her Majesty's Government to increase tax on North Sea oil and gas 
            profits by 10% but believes that any provision to this effect should 
            not be introduced until a full economic assessment has been conducted 
            of the impact of any changes on current and future employment and 
            exploration related to North Sea activities.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3038</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Inverness and 
            District Friends of ARMS</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Inverness and District Friends of ARMS group on its successful bid 
            for NHS Highland funding; notes the group's efforts in the delivery 
            of an invaluable physiotherapy service to Inverness and the rest of 
            the Highlands; welcomes the fact that the provision of an MS specialist 
            nurse will be additional to the direct funding; recognises the part 
            played by the MS Society Scotland, and undertakes to keep the issue 
            of specialised, rural health provision at the forefront of national 
            debate</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3037</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson: Motherwell Football 
            Club</strong>-That the Parliament notes with alarm the current crisis 
            at Motherwell Football Club; recognises that it is a symptom of the 
            financial crisis in the professional organisation of Scotland's national 
            game and that the current structure of its organisation is unsustainable; 
            appreciates the importance of Motherwell Football Club to the Scottish 
            game and to the people of Lanarkshire as well as the needs of the 
            employees of the club; acknowledges and further appreciates the many 
            attempts made by the outgoing ownership at Motherwell to invest in 
            the club and the game, but recognises that such investment is unsustainable 
            unless the overall structure of the Scottish professional game is 
            sustainable and viable, and calls for all leaders of Scottish Football 
            to consider a wide-ranging and radical overhaul of the structure of 
            the Scottish game and leagues in order to ensure competitiveness at 
            all levels and the growth of community-based clubs encouraging domestic 
            talent and to ensure that there are opportunities for clubs to grow 
            and progress through the leagues from all levels and, if necessary, 
            to move on to larger, non-domestic leagues if that is to their financial 
            and sporting advantage. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3036</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: A90 Dualling from Tipperty 
            to Balmedie</strong>-That the Parliament notes the dangerously high 
            levels of congestion on the A90 north of Aberdeen, the expected increase 
            in traffic from the proposed new housing developments which will rely 
            on this route and the poor accident record, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to upgrade the single carriageway Tipperty to Balmedie stretch 
            of the A90 to dual carriageway.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3035</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: PGCE Secondary 
            Courses in Geography, Drama, Biology and Chemistry at Jordanhill Campus</strong>-That 
            the Parliament deplores the decision of the Scottish Executive to 
            direct the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to limit the 
            recruitment of students at Jordanhill Campus of the University of 
            Strathclyde in the areas of geography, drama, biology and chemistry 
            to not more than 85, having the month before indicated to the University 
            that they should expect to recruit some 175 such students, a decision 
            which has resulted in the University issuing 136 legally binding offers 
            for such courses for which they will now receive funding for only 
            85; notes that the Principal of the University of Strathclyde has 
            described the Executive's decision as "capricious and ill-considered", 
            and calls upon the Executive to review its decision.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3034#</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson: Meares - Irlen 
            Syndrome</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Meares-Irlen syndrome 
            affects up to one-third of all young people and, in the worst cases, 
            has a serious impact on their learning in the early years; further 
            notes that, for many children, its effects can be mitigated by colour 
            overlays or lenses but that the facilities within the Scottish health 
            service to diagnose and treat this syndrome are few and far between, 
            and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should work with 
            the NHS and the education authorities to ensure early diagnosis of 
            this syndrome and to put in place cost-effective methods of treating 
            it. </p>
          <p><strong><a name="3032"></a>S1M-3032#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: 
            Scotland and Europe Day</strong>-That the Parliament is proud to mark 
            Europe Day as a celebration of the founding of the European Union 
            (EU); endorses the fundamental principles of the EU as set out in 
            the Declaration by Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950; welcomes the contribution 
            that the EU has made towards peace and solidarity across Europe; notes 
            the relevance of the EU to the working of the Scottish Parliament 
            and to the everyday lives of Scots, and encourages the people of Scotland, 
            young and old, to join with citizens across Europe, in the celebration 
            of our common values and to participate in the debate on the future 
            of Europe.</p>

            of Irene Oldfather, leave out from &quot;encourages&quot; to end and 
            insert &quot;looks forward to this relevance being enhanced when Scotland

          <p><strong>S1M-3031</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Reduction in Wheelchair 
            Accessible Seats in New Parliament Chamber</strong>-That the Parliament 
            regrets that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, whilst noting 
            the dissent of the Holyrood Progress Group, has instructed that the 
            Chamber design in the new Parliament building be altered from that 
            circulated to all members and agreed in September 1999, with the result 
            that the choice of accessible Chamber seats for any member using a 
            standard wheelchair is reduced from 81 to 61.</p>

            and welcomes the benefits brought about by living in a racially and 
            culturally diverse community; notes with concern the rise of far right 
            extremism in Europe, and supports the call from the European Monitoring

            animal abuse and violence towards humans; considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should commission research into (a) the correlation between 
            domestic violence, child abuse and animal abuse and (b) therapeutic 
            programmes to address children's abuse of animals, and believes that 
            a protocol for the reporting of such incidents should be introduced 
            across all respective agencies.</p>

            the Parliament expresses concern at the removal of Dr Robert Watson 
            as Chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change following 
            last year's publication of its Third Assessment Report (TAR) which 
            states that global temperatures are rising nearly twice as fast as 
            previously thought, predicts that temperatures could rise by as much 
            as 5.8 degrees celsius by the end of this century and claims that 
            industrial pollution is the main cause; notes that the TAR report 
            has the unqualified backing of more than 3,000 scientists; expresses 
            dismay at President Bush's continued refusal to recognise the link 
            between pollution and global warming; urges the President to reinstate 
            America's support for the Kyoto Protocol, and further notes Scotland's 
            determination to play its full part in tackling the threat of global 
            warming</p>

            National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), on its 150th anniversary; believes

            crews, fleet renewals, the fundraising activities of dedicated RNLI

            editors and staff of the magazine who ensured its survival during 
            difficult years, including the two world wars, and, in particular, 
            offers sincere thanks to the crews of the lifeboats whose bravery 
            is so readily acknowledged in the pages of <em>The Lifeboat </em>and

            that such treatment is unacceptable and perpetuates ageism in society,

            in the attitudes of both public and private sector organisations, 
            allied to continued media stereotyping of older people, and therefore 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should identify and address 
            areas of age discrimination in Scottish public life so that older 
            people feel valued and can make a full and positive contribution to 
            society.</a></p>
