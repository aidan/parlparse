    Parliament commends Age Concern on its recently published report <i>Turning Your Back on
    Us: Older People and the NHS</i> which deals with the serious problem of age
    discrimination in the National Health Service; believes that medical treatment and care
    should not be denied or delayed simply on the basis of age; and urges the Scottish
    Executive to commission an independent investigation to assess whether age discrimination
    is practised in the National Health Service and to produce an agenda for action if such
    discrimination exists.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-526</b> <strong>Trish Godman: Equal Access for People with Disabilities</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament warmly commends the action taken by the journalist Kirsty Wark and her
    friends in leaving a Glasgow city nightclub when the staff refused access to a disabled
    patron; hopes that the management of said club will now adopt a welcoming attitude to
    patrons with disabilities, and urges others to follow Kirsty Wark&#146;s admirable lead

    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-525</b> <strong>Trish Godman: West of Scotland Water Authority</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament deplores the high-handed and insensitive conduct of senior officials at
    West of Scotland Water Authority in relation to the unsupportable decision to allow raw
    sewage and waste water to enter the Kilbarchan Burn; affirms the view that such
    authorities must always be cognisant of local community concerns when taking decisions
    that impinge upon local communities; and that genuine consultation and concern for public
    health must always be the order the day when making such decisions.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Hugh Henry<b>*</p>

    acute services by Tayside Health Board; recognises the continuing importance of the Unit
    for neurosurgery services across Tayside and Scotland; and invites the Scottish Executive
    to re-affirm its support for this unit.</p>

    the Parliament calls upon the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to cancel its

    Parliament hopes that the historic victory of Inverness Caledonian Thistle over Celtic on
    8 February 2000 will be followed by success for Inverness in being awarded City status,

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-521</b> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Excell Call Centre, Glasgow</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament expresses deep concern over health and safety and employment practice at
    Excell Call Centre in Glasgow; deplores the sacking and intimidation of staff who have
    exposed Excell&#146;s record; awaits with interest the report of the Health and Safety

    Scottish Homing Union and other pigeon fanciers in Scotland on the impact that raptors are
    having on their sport; and believes that the Scottish Executive and all interested parties
    should work together to ensure the appropriate protection of both raptors and racing
    pigeons so as to enable the continuation of pigeon racing as a sport in Scotland.</p>

    upon the Scottish Executive to (a) introduce a Bill to amend the Census Act 1920 to enable
