    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-550</b> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: Debate on Tourism</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Scottish Executive of the New Strategy for
    Scottish Tourism and commends this as the way to achieve a modern tourist industry in
    touch with its customers, a skilled and enterprising industry that has embraced the
    culture of lifelong learning, and an industry that provides the high quality of service
    our visitors demand.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-549</b> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Agrimoney Compensation</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the strength of sterling in comparison to the Euro is disadvantaging
    Scotland&#146;s farmers and that agrimoney compensation is available from the European
    Union to address the effects of such currency fluctuations; believes that this aid is
    urgently needed to address the serious financial difficulties being experienced across all
    sectors of Scottish agriculture; notes that action is needed at a UK level to secure a
    total of £92 million in additional payments to Scottish farmers; acknowledges that the
    Scottish Executive has made representations to Westminster outlining the need for this
    aid, and therefore calls upon Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury to put in place the necessary
    financial arrangements and match funding to secure the additional European money at the
    earliest opportunity.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-548</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Tax Relief on Ministerial Vehicles</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with surprise that the tax relief for ministerial cars and chauffeurs
    has been extended to Scottish Executive Ministers; believes that this represents a
    fundamental inequality in tax treatment and calls upon Scottish Executive Ministers to
    make a £5,000 donation to the NHS in lieu of their tax bill.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-547#</b> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Children in Glasgow Selling
    Newspapers Late at Night</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the illegal
    employment of children under sixteen years to sell newspapers in the streets of Glasgow,
    at city road junctions, outside pubs and clubs late at night and in the early hours of the
    morning in all weathers, to the detriment of their health and education and leaving them
    exposed to the possible attention of individuals with evil intent, and believes that the
    newspaper publishers concerned should ensure that their distributors do not employ vendors
    who recruit children, that the public should not buy these newspapers and that Strathclyde
    Police should vigorously enforce the law in this regard.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-546</b> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Chinook</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with concern that the National Audit Office found that the FADEC computer
    system fitted to Chinook helicopters was flawed and that this posed an
    &quot;unquantifiable risk&quot; for these craft; further notes the reported out of court
    settlement with the family of one of the pilots, and therefore calls for a judicial
    inquiry firstly into the crash, and secondly into the subsequent investigations, including
    the failure of the &quot;unquantifiable risk&quot; associated with FADEC to be advised to
    the fatal accident inquiry. </p>
