<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4314#</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Madras College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the report by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIe) on Madras College, St Andrews; notes with particular concern that HMIe considered that the dispersed accommodation has a negative impact on learning, teaching and the school&rsquo;s capacity to supervise behaviour and also considered the school accommodation to be unsatisfactory; regrets that, by failing to address the known deficiencies of the multi-site accommodation at Madras College, Fife Council has let down a generation of schoolchildren, and believes that Fife Council should take urgent action to address the unsatisfactory accommodation by constructing a new school to serve the Tay Bridgehead area and a new, or refurbished, Madras College on a single site in St Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4313</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>Lack of Front-line Police Officers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concerns expressed by Norrie Flowers, Chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, that new duties imposed on police forces &quot;have taken police officers away from the front line&quot; and that this has resulted in a situation where &quot;there are not enough community beat officers and our response officers are seriously overstretched, running from call to call with little time to do other than record complaints and file them&quot;; believes that, in many areas, the lack of front-line police officers has resulted in a public loss of confidence in the police service and a feeling in many communities that there is no point in reporting crimes as the police will not attend; considers that to resolve these problems police forces must continue to work in partnership with communities and must have sufficient officers to respond to and deal effectively with all calls for assistance, however minor, when the calls are received: believes that this will not be achievable until the Scottish Executive accepts that, while there may be more serving police officers today than in previous years, more officers are also now seconded to specialist services and that, therefore, there are actually fewer police officers on the streets responding to the needs of the people of Scotland, and calls for police authorities and joint boards to be provided with sufficient funding to allow chief constables to ensure that enough front-line police officers are employed to fully support local communities and tackle all levels of crime as it occurs.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4312&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Welcome to the CIVICUS World Assembly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the CIVICUS World Assembly to be held in Glasgow in June 2006; notes and recognises the work of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations in securing and organising this event in Scotland for the next three years; commends the work of CIVICUS in promoting civil society throughout the world; welcomes the interaction of voluntary organisations and the exchange of ideas and experiences to develop common strategies to improve justice and democracy; recognises that delegates to the world assembly are from grassroots organisations which campaign for the poorest and most disadvantaged members of society, and believes that MSPs should support this event actively.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4311</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Bathgate Thistle</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Bathgate Thistle on reaching the final of the OVD Scottish Junior Cup; recognises that their nail-biting semi-final victory, after extra time, over Irvine Meadow means that they have reached the final for the first time in their history, and wishes all supporters an enjoyable day out when they play Auchinleck Talbot at Rugby Park in Kilmarnock on 21 May 2006.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4310</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4284#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Funding the Voluntary Sector</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the funding problems faced by many voluntary organisations, including groups involved in youth work, caring, and advice and support-giving services in Central Scotland, to which the general method of public funding contributes, with its over-emphasis on funding mainly innovative projects for no longer than three years; welcomes some useful funding initiatives by the Scottish Executive and local authorities, imaginative new ways of deciding on the distribution of funding set up by the Big Lottery Fund and other grant givers, some progress towards better targeted funding of community enterprises and the social economy, and full cost recovery in project funding; believes, however, that the funding system should concentrate first on providing successful voluntary organisations with continued core funding, guaranteed so long as a group fulfils its remit of public benefit, and second on providing continuing funding for proven successful projects rather than insisting that projects have to be reinvented to claim that they are innovative, and considers that the Executive, local authorities, other public and charitable grant-giving bodies and the Big Lottery Fund should co-operate in developing policies along these lines.</p>
