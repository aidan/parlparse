          <p><strong>*S1M-2434</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Prioritising 
            the Borders Economy</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the report 
            of 7 November 2001 by the Director of Lifelong Care at Scottish Borders 
            Council on the impact in the area of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak 
            and, in particular, paragraph 12.1, <i>Economic Impact</i>, where 
            it is estimated that the losses to the Borders economy over the coming 
            year will be £30 million to tourism, £14 million to agriculture and 
            related industries and £27 million to the electronics industry, representing 
            7% of Borders GDP; expresses concern that Signum Circuits, Selkirk, 
            which re-employed many former Viasystems workers, has now gone into 
            receivership with the immediate redundancy of some 49 employees and 
            with bleak prospects for the remaining 132 employees, in an area with 
            the lowest average earnings in Scotland and an ageing population, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive, in the light of these circumstances, 
            to prioritise the Borders as a matter of urgency for future economic 
            investment and funding, including support for local businesses, in 
            order to modernise the area&#146;s infrastructure and thus halt this 
            economic haemorrhage.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2433</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: North Glasgow 
            University Hospitals NHS Trust's Handling of Industrial Action</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament condemns the North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS 
            Trust&#146;s incompetent handling of the month-long medical secretaries&#146; 
            dispute; believes that the secretaries have been forced into industrial 
            action by low pay, an unfair grading system and an intransigent attitude 
            on the part of the Trust&#146;s management; further believes that 
            the secretaries were forced to resume all-out strike action when the 
            Trust reneged on the agreement negotiated between staff and management 
            on 24 October 2001, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring pressure 
            to bear on the Trust to honour that agreement. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2432</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Benefits Agency 
            Industrial Action</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the current 
            industrial action being taken by members of the PCS at Benefits Agency 
            offices throughout Scotland in pursuit of their demand for the retention 
            of safety screens in the new Jobcentre Plus offices; finds it unacceptable 
            that Benefits Agency workers should be exposed to increased physical 
            attacks from members of the public without adequate protection; believes 
            that these workers on the front line of government services should 
            be able to expect that their concerns are addressed promptly and in 
            full, and recognises that, until these workers are adequately resourced 
            to deliver realistic benefits and compassionate services, they will 
            require the retention of these screens. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2431#</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson: Diabetes 
            in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">recognises 
            that diabetes is a serious condition affecting over 220,000 people 
            and their families across Scotland and that complications arising 
            from it can have a devastating effect on individuals, including a 
            loss of sight, chronic heart disease and limb amputation; notes that 
            this figure could double over the next decade and that the number 
            of people with undiagnosed diabetes is estimated to be over 90,000, 
            a figure which is unacceptable, and believes that it is vital that 
            the Scottish Diabetes Framework, once published, should become the 
            vehicle for producing short, medium and long-term solutions to this 
            public health challenge. </a></p>
