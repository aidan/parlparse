          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1591</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Financial Settlements for Islands Councils</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the Aggregate External Finance settlement for Orkney Islands Council whereby Orkney receives 20% per head less funding than either the Western Isles or Shetland Islands Councils; notes that all three Islands Councils face broadly similar difficulties and cost pressures in providing services; further notes that Orkney Islands Council has contributed &pound;6 million pounds in the current year from the council's Relevant Services Contingency Fund, an oil industry-related fund, which will be needed to meet the very substantial costs of decommissioning the Flotta oil terminal and help stimulate economic development once the benefits of the oil industry are lost to the local economy, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take action to address this anomaly.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1590#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Scotland's Regiments</strong>-That the Parliament notes the outstanding commitment and service of Scotland's six infantry regiments for this country over the centuries; further notes that the recent war in Iraq was the latest conflict which showed Scotland's regiments to be a modern, effective fighting force as well as institutions steeped in history and tradition; condemns the proposed loss of one of Scotland's regiments and the amalgamation of existing regiments into one or two new regiments, with the resultant loss of individual regimental identity and traditions; believes that, in a time of increased commitments across the globe, our armed forces must have the necessary resources and structure to protect our country, deter aggression and safeguard our vital interests in the wider world, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make urgent representations to the Ministry of Defence against these proposals in the interests of the Scottish economy and Scotland's military culture.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1589</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Agenda For Change</strong>-That the Parliament believes that Agenda for Change will not address pay inequalities in the NHS and that through it far too many NHS workers will lose out in pay and other terms and conditions; notes that increases for medical staff will be proportionately far greater than any gains by other groups of NHS staff, which perpetuates the historical undervaluation of non-medical NHS staff; is particularly concerned about the implications for ancillary, administration and clerical, speech and language therapy and other staff; believes that unsocial hours will be inadequately rewarded; is further concerned that Agenda for Change does not fulfil either the Scottish Executive's, employers' or trade unions' obligations to ensure equal pay for women; believes that such flaws will lead to increased recruitment and retention problems in the NHS, placing further constraints on NHS capacity and the delivery of care; believes, therefore, that the Executive and employers are obliged to ensure that such a seriously flawed scheme is not implemented in the NHS, and considers that the Executive should withdraw the current proposals and reopen negotiations to achieve fair and equal pay and terms and conditions across the NHS without detriment to anyone.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1588</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>People First Borders</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the value of People First Borders, a self-advocacy movement for adults with learning difficulties where participants learn about their rights and how to improve their independence while in a supportive environment, building confidence and empowering each other; notes the crucial role of the volunteers as well as staff; congratulates it on the success of its recent annual conference which highlighted the transport difficulties for participants, and calls on the Scottish Executive to help publicise the Thistle Travel Card scheme and take other steps to assist those with learning difficulties to reach their full potential.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1587</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Continuing Concern at Hospital Services Review</strong>-That the Parliament notes with continuing alarm the results of the hospital service reviews within Glasgow and the west of Scotland; further notes that these reviews have led to the proposed or actual closure of, or diminution of services at, many hospitals within these areas, including Stobhill, Vale of Leven and the Victoria Infirmary among others and that the views of the public, which are overwhelmingly against the decisions taken so far by NHS Greater Glasgow and NHS Argyll and Clyde, are continually ignored, and therefore urges its members to support a moratorium on any planned diminution of services until the Minister for Health and Community Care takes on board the views of the people who will have to live with the results of these cuts and to fight for the continuation of their local services.</P>
