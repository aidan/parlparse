          <P><strong>*S2M-1758</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Small Towns Under Threat Conference</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Borders Council on its recent initiative to hold a conference on small towns under threat in Newton St Boswells on 17 September 2004 and notes that the conference will ensure that the issues facing Scottish small towns are highlighted and help to create a campaign for more support and investment in small towns and for the key role of small towns to be more fully recognised in public policy terms.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1757#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Moray&rsquo;s RAF Bases at Kinloss and Lossiemouth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes a report by Highlands and Islands Enterprise which revealed that 5,000 jobs in Moray are supported directly and 750 indirectly by the RAF bases at Kinloss and Lossiemouth; further notes that &pound;72 million of income is generated directly and &pound;21 million indirectly by the bases; is deeply concerned at the announcement of 390 job losses at RAF Lossiemouth, at the uncertainty over further job losses at RAF Lossiemouth and over possible losses at RAF Kinloss; believes that Moray&rsquo;s bases play a vital part in the economic and social life of Moray, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make immediate representations to the Ministry of Defence to ensure the future of both bases and to avoid the devastating impact that the loss of these RAF bases would have on Moray&rsquo;s economy.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1755</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Congratulations on Move to Holyrood</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the smooth flitting of equipment, papers and materials from George IV Bridge during the migration to Holyrood and warmly congratulates the workforce involved, the implementation team, planners, porters and others, for having successfully performed this unique operation.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1754</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Embargo on Arms Sales to China</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the continued EU embargo on arms sales to China.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1753#</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Railway Masts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Network Rail has been given permitted development rights with regard to safety work on railway lines; notes that it is currently erecting 29-metre high masts in residential areas across Strathclyde to support its GSM-R safety communication equipment with little or no consultation with local residents; notes that considerable doubts have been expressed as to whether its proposed system has been fully tested, is suitable and whether it will be technologically obsolescent before the system is completed across the United Kingdom, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should require Network Rail to go through normal planning application procedures before proceeding with the erection of further masts.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1752 Withdrawn</strong></P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1751</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>16th Spencer Dayman Meningitis UK Walk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of, and participants in, the 16th Spencer Dayman Meningitis UK walk which covers 770 miles from Peterhead to Lyme Regis in 36 days and notes that the charity has not only raised over &pound;1 million to fund research into producing a vaccine to protect against all forms of bacterial meningitis which affected 2,411 people in 2003, but also substantially raises public awareness of this potentially fatal disease.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Brian Monteith</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1750#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>International Credit Union Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes International Credit Union Day which will take place on 21 October 2004; acknowledges the financial benefits that credit unions provide for their members through low-cost loans and savings; supports the co-operative and democratic nature of credit unions in that they involve members in their running and organisation; recognises the contribution made by the growing number of credit unions throughout the country in encouraging people to save regularly; welcomes their promotion of financial security, and applauds the role credit unions have played, and continue to play, in the regeneration of communities throughout Scotland.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill, Dr Sylvia Jackson, Mike Pringle, Christine May, Colin Fox, Eleanor Scott, Murray Tosh, Mary Scanlon, Bristow Muldoon, Mark Ballard, Dr Elaine Murray, Michael Matheson, Jackie Baillie, Alasdair Morgan, Chris Ballance, Alex Neil, Carolyn Leckie, Mr Duncan McNeil, Elaine Smith, Ms Wendy Alexander, Bruce Crawford, Helen Eadie, Stewart Stevenson, Des McNulty, Scott Barrie, Kate Maclean, Janis Hughes, Nora Radcliffe, Shiona Baird, Christine Grahame, Johann Lamont, Sarah Boyack, Patrick Harvie, Marilyn Livingstone, Margaret Jamieson, Pauline McNeill, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Maureen Macmillan<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Margo MacDonald<strong>*</strong>, John Swinburne<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1749</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Draft Freedom of Information (Fees for Required Disclosure) (Scotland) Regulations 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the draft Freedom of Information (Fees for Required Disclosure) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 be approved.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1748</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>A Parliamentary Building Users&rsquo; Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) to set up a Parliament Building Users&rsquo; Committee with representatives of MSPs, MSPs&rsquo; staff, parliamentary staff and the parliamentary media to consider suggestions and complaints about the building and its management and possible use and to empower the committee to either make decisions or make recommendations to the SPCB.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Margo MacDonald<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1729#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is opposed to the transfer of council housing stocks out of local authority control and into the hands of housing associations; believes that this policy represents the abandonment of the ethos of public sector housing provision; recognises the failure in the right to buy legislation to allow local authorities to reinvest monies received in new rented housing stock and the need to change this injustice; further recognises that many council properties were sold off for less than it cost to build them and that local authority tenants were, in effect, subsidising the right to buy scheme itself; believes that publicly-owned, high quality rented accommodation is badly needed in Scotland, and considers that council tenants in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen should vote against stock transfer proposals in local referenda in favour of a council house building programme that serves the need of tens of thousands of Scottish families for affordable, high quality rented accommodation which remains owned by us all and where the management remains accountable to the public it serves.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, Frances Curran</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1728#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Jubilee Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Jubilee Scotland exhibition in the Garden Lobby from 20 to 23 September 2004; welcomes the work of Jubilee Scotland in campaigning for cancellation of unsustainable debt in developing countries; welcomes the exhibition&rsquo;s focus on the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles; further notes that it would cost only &pound;3 per person per year over the next 10 years to cancel our share of third world debt, and finally notes that a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to this effect is available for members and staff to sign.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1726</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Delay in Tenant Farmers&rsquo; Right to Buy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the delays to the implementation of Parts 2 and 6 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 that will give a pre-emptive right to buy to tenant farmers; is further concerned that this delay is allowing landowners to rush through sales of agricultural land in order to evade the will of the Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Executive to give a high priority to its consideration of the responses to the current consultation on the implementation of this measure so that tenants&rsquo; right to buy can be implemented without further delay.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Donald Gorrie, Christine Grahame, Fergus Ewing, Richard Lochhead</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1725#</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon:</strong> <strong>St John&rsquo;s Hospital in Livingston</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that it is not in the best interests of the people of Lothian that, with effect from 27 September 2004, NHS Lothian intends to remove emergency and major general surgery from St John&rsquo;s Hospital, in spite of it being a modern hospital with an excellent clinical record and a recently-expanded accident and emergency department; further believes that it is outrageous that NHS Lothian made a decision to remove this service and trauma orthopaedic surgery without full public consultation or ministerial approval, and considers that the Minister for Health and Community Care should urgently intervene and require that the emergency surgical services are properly resourced to sustain the services at St John&rsquo;s.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill, Donald Gorrie, Colin Fox, Frances Curran, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Carolyn Leckie, Fiona Hyslop, Robin Harper, Dr Jean Turner, Pauline McNeill</P>

          <P>Supported by: Donald Gorrie, Eleanor Scott, Mr Jamie Stone, John Farquhar Munro, Rob Gibson, Dr Jean Turner, Mary Scanlon, Marilyn Livingstone, Mr Brian Monteith</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1723#</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Development of Edinburgh Airport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of Edinburgh Airport to the local, regional and national economy; further notes projections in Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s white paper, <em>The Future of Air Transport</em>, that Edinburgh Airport will need a second runway by 2020; is sceptical that these projected passenger number increases will necessarily come to pass; recognises that, while setting aside land for any second runway may be a sensible precaution, it creates planning blight for a number of households and concern for many others and that construction would necessitate relocation of the Royal Highland showground; believes BAA plc must engage with all the local communities around the airport and keep them up to date with development plans at the airport in as open and transparent a fashion as possible; recognises the problem of noise pollution from current flight levels; believes that greater provision of high-speed rail could offer genuine alternatives to short-haul air travel, with the added benefit of freeing up capacity for more long-haul international flights and reducing the need for a second runway; welcomes the development of tram and rail links to Edinburgh Airport and the development of all transport links that will reduce congestion in the area, and considers that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government, the Scottish Executive, BAA plc and all concerned should help deliver sustainable, long-term development of Edinburgh Airport.</P>
