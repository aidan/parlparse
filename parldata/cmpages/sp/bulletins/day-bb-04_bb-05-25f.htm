          <p><strong>*S2M-1356</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Statutory 
            Regulation of Acupuncture</strong>-That the Parliament notes the consultation 
            <em>Regulation of herbal medicine and acupuncture: Proposals for statutory 
            regulation</em> being undertaken by Her Majesty's Government's Department 
            of Health, and notes that this encompasses regulation of complementary 
            and alternative medicine in Scotland; notes that these proposals for 
            statutory regulation favour the establishment of a shared Complementary 
            and Alternative Medicine Council for herbal medicine and traditional 
            acupuncture which could then be extended to other unregulated complementary 
            and alternative medicine professions; further notes that health delivery 
            in Scotland is different to that in the rest of the United Kingdom 
            and, therefore, may require different measures to the rest of the 
            UK; notes that traditional acupuncture is a central part of the system 
            of Chinese medicine, which is a holistic approach to health based 
            on over 2000 years of observation and analysis, and has a distinct 
            theoretical basis; notes the high standards of regulation, health 
            and safety provision, extensive training and professional codes of 
            practice of those practitioners who are accredited by the British 
            Acupuncture Council, the UK's main regulatory and representative body 
            for the practice of acupuncture involving over 2,400 professionally-qualified 
            acupuncturists; believes that Chinese medicine, as a separate system 
            of medical practice, should be defined, governed and accredited separately 
            and according to the current standards of the British Acupuncture 
            Council, British Acupuncture Accreditation Board and World Health 
            Organization; believes that medical and other practitioners working 
            within the western medical tradition should avoid the term acupuncture 
            unless it is used as part of the Chinese medicine medical tradition, 
            and believes that the distinct benefits and attributes of Chinese 
            medicine should be recognised by the creation of a separate statutory 
            body to accredit, govern and act as a professional body to these activities.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1355</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Murrayfield 
            Alcohol Ban</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the vital role 
            played by the Scottish Rugby Union in promoting rugby both at international 
            and grassroots level; further recognises the financial difficulties 
            and burdens faced by, and placed upon, it; is aware of the proposal 
            within the Nicholson report to trial alcohol sales at a sports ground; 
            notes the success of the BT Cup Final and the Scotland versus Barbarians 
            matches at Murrayfield at which alcohol was sold; recalls that there 
            has never been any history of crowd trouble at rugby internationals 
            in Scotland; notes that alcohol may be sold at pop concerts, rugby 
            league games and American football matches but not at rugby internationals 
            at the stadium; further notes that Murrayfield is the only major venue 
            in the Six Nations rugby tournament to have alcohol provision precluded 
            at international matches, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to review its proposal to continue the ban on the selling of alcohol 
            at international games at Scottish rugby's national stadium.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1354#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Healthy Food for Highland Schools</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Highland Council for its decision to source locally as much of its 
            £2.5 million contracts for foodstuffs, including fresh fruit and vegetables, 
            as possible, to promote food education for children and parents alike; 
            welcomes the decision of the council's Education, Culture and Sport 
            Committee to raise awareness among local suppliers whose successful 
            tenders included the supply of organic fruit and vegetables; believes 
            that the proposed pilot in Strathpeffer Primary School based on the 
            principles of &quot;Food for Life&quot; is a most welcome step that 
            sets a good example by insisting that 50% or more food is sourced 
            locally, with ingredients to include 30% organic and 75% unprocessed 
            foodstuffs, and praises the council's public procurement policy as 
            part of major moves towards the aim of maximum local sourcing to provide 
            best quality school meals that can be produced within budget constraints.</P>
