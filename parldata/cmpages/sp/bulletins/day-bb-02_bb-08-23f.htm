          <p><strong>*S1M-3321#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Future Development 
            of Glasgow Airport</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication 
            of the consultation paper, <em>The Future Development of Air Transport 
            in the United Kingdom: Scotland</em>; further notes that Her Majesty's 
            Government believes that Scotland needs one new runway by 2030; is 
            concerned at the reports that Glasgow Airport could lose out in future 
            expansion plans, and believes that the Scottish Executive should recognise 
            the pivotal role that the airport plays in the economy of Glasgow, 
            the west of Scotland and indeed the nation as a whole and take whatever 
            measures necessary to ensure that Glasgow Airport benefits from any 
            future air transport development in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3320</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Future Provision 
            of NHS Services in Greater Glasgow NHS Board Area </strong>-That the 
            Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to reconsider its decision 
            to approve the plans of Greater Glasgow NHS Board for the future provision 
            of accident and emergency and other hospital services within the board 
            area, in light of the serious public concerns which have been expressed 
            about the proposals.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David McLetchie<strong>*</strong>, Mr Brian Monteith<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh<strong>*</strong>, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mr Keith Harding<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, 
            Ben Wallace<strong>*</strong>, Alex Johnstone<strong>*</strong>, John 
            Scott<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3319</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Aberdeen City 
            Council Planning Application for a Football Stadium and Other Facilities 
            at Kingswells</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern Aberdeen 
            City Council's willingness to approve a planning application for a 
            new football stadium and other facilities on a green belt site at 
            Kingswells; further notes that many residents in the north east feel 
            that this site lacks the necessary infrastructure to support such 
            a development; agrees that the recent allegations of wrong doing within 
            the council have undermined the public's confidence in the openness 
            and transparency of the planning process, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to hold a public inquiry on the application as a matter 
            of urgency.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3318</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Scotland vs Israel 
            Under 21s Football Match</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its 
            deep concern at the recent decision by the Scottish Football Association 
            to arrange a fixture on 4 September 2002 between the Scottish and 
            Israeli under-21 football teams whilst the state of Israel flaunts 
            its illegal actions against Palestinian citizens in the face of international 
            condemnation and successive UN resolutions; notes that Israel denies 
            young Palestinians their right to participate in international football 
            tournaments by refusing to accept that there are two sets of people, 
            Israelis and Palestinians, requiring two separate and independent 
            states; is further concerned that under Israeli conscription, the 
            under-21 team members will be serving soldiers in the Israeli Defence 
            Force which is conducting a war of attrition against innocent Palestinian 
            civilians in the occupied territories and which has obliterated Palestinian 
            sports facilities, denied Palestinian football teams the right to 
            travel to play matches, and closed down and driven tanks through Palestinian 
            schools and universities playing fields, and calls on the Scottish 
            Football Association to recognise the strength of opposition to this 
            fixture and postpone the match until the day that Scottish, Israeli 
            and Palestinian youths can play football together on an equal basis 
            and in a spirit of friendship and recognition.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3317</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Stoning of Amina 
            Lawal</strong>-That the Parliament notes with horror the threatened 
            stoning to death of a Nigerian woman Amina Lawal; calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to make urgent representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            to ask it to intervene with the Nigerian Government to prevent this 
            atrocity and believes that Nigeria cannot remain part of the Commonwealth 
            and international community if it enforces the sentence.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3316#</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: MMR and Autism 
            Research</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent announcement 
            by Her Majesty's Government of a £300,000 funding package to carry 
            out a study into a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism; 
            acknowledges the genuine reservations parents have regarding sanctioning 
            the use of the MMR vaccine and invites the Scottish Executive to consider 
            initiating a similar research study.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3315</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Pension Package 
            for Scottish Executive Permanent Secretary</strong>-That the Parliament 
            condemns the excessive severance payment and pension package which 
            will be made available to the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish 
            Executive, Sir Muir Russell on his early retirement in 2003; believes 
            that the £150,000 lump sum and £50,000 per annum pension package for 
            less than six years as Permanent Secretary is outrageous, insensitive 
            to those earning a low income and an abuse of public money, and calls 
            for a public inquiry involving representatives of the Scottish pensioners' 
            movement, civil service trade unionists and anti-poverty groups before 
            any payment from funds is made to Sir Muir.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3314</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Ordnance Survey 
            - Education Initiative</strong>-That the Parliament notes Ordnance 
            Survey's new education initiative which will provide around 50,000 
            primary 7 pupils in 1,500 Scottish schools with a map of their local 
            area, along with explanatory leaflets, homework help and direct educational 
            support; recognises that these maps can assist students in a number 
            of subjects, including geography, environmental studies, local history 
            and citizenship, helping children to understand and interpret the 
            environment in which they live, and congratulates Ordnance Survey 
            for the success of the initiative and their commitment to education.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3313</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Mismanagement 
            in Further Education Colleges</strong>-That the Parliament invites 
            the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Further Education Funding Council, 
            the further education sector generally and education trade unions 
            to conduct a full and urgent investigation into any mismanagement 
            of further education colleges and any unfair treatment of trade union 
            members and activists at the colleges, and condemns any such treatment.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3312</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Ancillary Staff 
            in the NHS</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the victorious 
            ancillary workers of Glasgow Royal Infirmary who were forced to take 
            strike action in pursuit of improved wages and employment conditions 
            against the giant French multi-national Sodexho; condemns private 
            contractors that continue to pay poverty wages and refuse proper employment 
            conditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to re-nationalise 
            the National Health Service by removing all private contractors and 
            improving the wages and conditions of all ancillary staff, who are 
            essential to ensuring a first-class health service in the 21st century.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3310</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Flood Victims 
            in Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should provide financial aid to those flood victims in the 
            east end of Glasgow who have no flood insurance cover and face major 
            losses through no fault of their own, since the devastation to their 
            homes and property was caused by the inadequacy of the drainage system 
            serving their streets.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3309#</strong> <strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing: NHS Dental 
            Services in Moray</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that the 
            provision of NHS dental services in Moray has reached crisis point; 
            finds it unacceptable that residents of Moray now have to travel to 
            Aberdeen to register with an NHS dentist, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive and Grampian NHS Board should increase their efforts to 
            recruit and retain dentists to the area.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3308</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Salary Level of 
            Firefighters and Control Staff</strong>-That the Parliament declares 
            its fullest support for the Fire Brigades Union campaign for a new 
            £30,000 a year salary for firefighters and control staff without any 
            reduction in hard won and important employment conditions.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3307#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Diabetes and Tropical 
            Diseases Research Centre, Dundee</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the efforts of Sir Philip Cohen and other eminent scientists in trying 
            to secure funding for the new medical research centre into diabetes 
            and tropical diseases to be based in Dundee; believes that such a 
            development could be a world centre of excellence and may lead to 
            a breakthrough in understanding the causes of diabetes; notes with 
            concern that the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council has refused 
            to make up the shortfall in funding of £3.5 million required for the 
            centre; further notes that public spending on scientific research 
            has fallen by over one tenth in the last ten years, and therefore 
            invites the Scottish Executive to reconsider this decision and agree 
            to make up the funding shortfall to help put Dundee and Scotland at 
            the forefront of diabetes research.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3306</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Greater Glasgow 
            Acute Services Review</strong>-That the Parliament notes the decision 
            of the Minister for Health and Community Care to support the Greater 
            Glasgow NHS Board plan for acute hospital services across Glasgow; 
            believes that this decision fails to take account of overwhelming 
            opposition expressed by citizens throughout Glasgow to the reduction 
            of acute receiving centres to only two for the whole city; further 
            believes that the board did not properly consult the citizens of Glasgow 
            about its plans and ignored the response to the limited consultation 
            that took place which rejected the proposals to reduce the status 
            of both the Victoria and Stobhill Hospitals; has no confidence in 
            the ability of the board to reflect the opinions or demands of the 
            Glasgow population; further believes that the proposals will leave 
            Glasgow inadequately served in relation to emergencies and the number 
            of acute receiving beds across the city, and calls on the Minister 
            for Health and Community Care to reconsider his position and refuse 
            to support the unrepresentative proposals of the board.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3305</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Greater Pollok 
            Citizens Advice Bureau</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Greater Pollok Citizens Advice Bureau in securing full membership 
            of Citizens Advice Scotland in record time after the board and staff 
            underwent a major quality assurance audit; notes the heavy and increasing 
            workload of the bureau, and urges the Scottish Executive to commit 
            more and new resources in order to provide genuinely independent money, 
            debt and legal advice services and trained personnel throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Pauline McNeill<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3304</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: UK Position on 
            Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes the continued 
            threats by President George W Bush and the USA to affect a &quot;regime 
            change&quot; in Iraq by any means necessary; condemns the USA's bully-boy 
            tactics and its international sabre-rattling, which does nothing to 
            build greater unity, peace and harmony throughout our diverse world; 
            believes that the USA is increasingly isolated in its war-mongering 
            intentions to invade Iraq despite opposition from across Europe and 
            even from within the United Nations; calls on Her Majesty's Government 
            to issue a clear statement of opposition to involvement in any attack 
            on Iraq in the interests of promoting greater world peace and harmony, 
            and further believes that, should Her Majesty's Government commit 
            any support, physically or financially, to an American-led attack 
            on Iraq, a special debate should be arranged immediately in the Parliament.
