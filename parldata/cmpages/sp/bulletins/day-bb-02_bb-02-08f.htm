          <p><strong>*S1M-2724</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Raffan: Scottish Zimbabwe 
            Group</strong>&#151;That the Parliament offers its wholehearted support 
            to the Scotland Zimbabwe Group, recently formed to highlight the appalling 
            abuse of human rights in Zimbabwe; strongly endorses the principles 
            of the group, which seeks a free and fair presidential election in 
            Zimbabwe and freedom of speech for its people; encourages MSPs and 
            members of the public to attend the group&#146;s vigil to be held 
            on the Mound in Edinburgh on Saturday 9 February, so demonstrating 
            our solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe, and demands that the President 
            and Government of Zimbabwe cease their abuse of human rights forthwith 
            and show respect for both the rule of law and democracy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2723</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Burdens on 
            the Scotch Whisky Industry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            with concern Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s decision to apply 
            strip stamps to Scotch Whisky products, but not to wine or beer, in 
            an attempt to curb fraud; believes that the case for such strip stamps 
            is not yet proven as they are costly and relatively easy to forge, 
            as found in the USA and Greece where they have been abolished, and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should work with the Scotch whisky 
            industry to avoid such additional burdens being placed on our whisky 
            industry, for example by taking advantage of the exemption from the 
            EU&#146;s Water Framework Directive.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2722</strong> <strong>John Scott: Ayr United Football 
            Club</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates all the players, 
            staff and supporters of Ayr United Football Club on reaching the CIS 
            Insurance Cup Final, its first major cup final in the club&#146;s 
            92 year history; recognises the vital role played by the club in the 
            local community, and wishes the team every success for the remainder 
            of the season and beyond.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2721#</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan: National Outdoor 
            Training Centre, Aviemore</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes, 
            in this International Year of Mountains, the excellent training and 
            adventure courses provided by <strong>sport</strong>scotland at the 
            National Outdoor Training Centre at Glenmore Lodge, Aviemore and recognises 
            the importance of outdoor pursuits to the development of young people&#146;s 
            health, fitness and self-reliance, the worth of careers as instructors 
            for young people in rural areas and the importance of outdoor pursuits 
            such as skiing and mountaineering to the rural economy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2720</strong> <strong>Kay Ullrich: Ayr United Football 
            Club</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Ayr United Football 
            Club on the magnificent achievement of reaching the CIS Insurance 
            Cup Final and wishes the &quot;Honest Men&quot; continued success 
            in the tournament.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2719#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie: World Wide Clubhouse 
            Movement</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the establishment 
            in New York of the worldwide clubhouse movement for psychiatric rehabilitation 
            in 1948; further notes the siting of the first clubhouse in Scotland 
            under the management of the Scottish Association for Mental Health 
            in Dunfermline in 1992, which moved to new, expanded premises in the 
            summer of 2001 and is now one of seven situated throughout Scotland; 
            congratulates it on being the first in Scotland to be accredited by 
            the International Centre for Clubhouses; welcomes the success to date 
            of this innovative community care model for adults with a mental illness; 
            is aware that the members of the Dunfermline Clubhouse are currently 
            organising a major international conference at Heriot Watt University 
            from 3 to 6 July 2002 involving representatives from similar projects 
            in Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Australasia, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should encourage and expand this model 
            of community care.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2718#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie: NHS Fife</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates NHS Fife on its decision to bring all 
            domestic service, portering and catering contracts which were previously 
            outsourced back into the direct management of the NHS; notes that 
            due to an increase in the cleaning contract specification there will 
            be a welcome improvement in the general cleanliness of Fife&#146;s 
            health facilities which will benefit patients and several hundred 
            staff, and believes that this action recreates the &quot;NHS team&quot; 
            and that this policy should be extended throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2717#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Treatment 
            of Multiple Sclerosis</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Scottish Executive on its recent announcement which will ensure 
            that disease modifying drugs for multiple sclerosis sufferers (MS) 
            are made available on the NHS; recognises the role of MS campaigners 
            over many years on this issue; notes that up to 1,600 people with 
            MS could benefit from this decision; welcomes the innovative 'risk-taking' 
            scheme, and believes that a partnership approach with patients, the 
            voluntary sector and others must be an important part of the future 
            development of services for people with MS.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2716</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Scottish Executive 
            Policy on Advertising</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            current recruitment advertising policy of the Scottish Executive that 
            has seen over £1 million spent in the <em>Scotsman</em> and <em>Herald 
            </em>newspapers from 1998 to 2001 compared to barely £100,000 in the 
            <em>Courier </em>and <em>Press and Journal</em>; is concerned that the 
            dissemination of information on job availability with the Scottish 
            Executive may not reach many able candidates outwith the central belt, 
            particularly since the <em>Press and Journal </em>and <em>Courier </em>readerships 
            are on a par with the <em>Scotsman</em> and <em>Herald</em>; further notes 
            that more has been spent advertising vacancies in London based newspapers 
            than in newspapers in the north east of Scotland and that posts where 
            the specialism exists in this area, such as the Chief Executive of 
            the Fisheries Research Service, have not been advertised in north 
            east newspapers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review its 
            current policy to ensure that people from across all of Scotland learn 
            about available posts.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2715 The Scottish Arts Council and VisitScotland Traditional 
            Music and Tourism Initiative 2002</strong> (lodged on 6 February 2002)

            Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2713</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Ayr United Football 
            Club</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">congratulates 
            Ayr United Football Club for the historic achievement of reaching 
            its first national cup final in its 92 year history; welcomes the 
            abandonment of the Scottish Executive&#146;s appeal against the planning 
            consent for a new stadium, and believes that this new stadium will 
            be a most fitting tribute to the club.</a></p>
