<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only  printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the  complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is  published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains any motions lodged  for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for  debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol  (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (u).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a  declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk  or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3417 Cathie Craigie: Muscular  Dystrophy &ldquo;My Life&rdquo; Campaign&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament supports the 3,000  people in Scotland with inherited neuromuscular disorders and muscular  dystrophy; supports the work of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign in pioneering  the search for treatments and cures for over 40 years, whilst also providing  practical, professional and emotional support for people affected by  neuromuscular conditions; supports the Muscular Dystrophy &ldquo;My Life&rdquo; campaign  and its work in Scotland to encourage a co-ordinated approach by local  authorities and NHS boards when assessing individuals&rsquo; needs and requirements,  and considers the findings of the My Life expert group to be a model for future  delivery of services to people affected by neuromuscular conditions.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3416 Patrick Harvie: Protect  the Human&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Amnesty  International&rsquo;s (AI) new initiative, Protect the Human Week, from 16 to 22  October 2005 which will see schools across Scotland lobby the Home Office to  implement key recommendations from AI&rsquo;s report, <em>Seeking Asylum is not a  Crime</em>; notes AI&rsquo;s concerns regarding the detrimental effects of detention,  especially on those who are particularly vulnerable such as elderly people,  mentally ill people and torture survivors; notes the growing momentum in the  Parliament and Scottish civic society to ensure that the children of  asylum-seeking families are treated humanely; calls on the Scottish Executive  urgently to conclude negotiations with the Home Office regarding a protocol on  the removal of asylum seekers and to ensure that it includes an endorsement of  children&rsquo;s rights as defined in the UN Convention on the Rights Of The Child,  and congratulates children and schools across Scotland who participate in the  AI campaign in defence of human rights.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3415u Roseanna Cunningham: TV Licence and Digital Reception&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament recognises that there are still many areas in Scotland,  including parts of Perthshire, where digital television reception is not  possible; notes with concern the desire by the BBC to increase the television  licence fee by 2.3% above inflation, and believes that, until such time as the  BBC&rsquo;s entire broadcast output is available to all licence payers, a  differential should be introduced into the licence fee to ensure that people  who are not receiving a full service do not pay the same licence fee as those  who do.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3414 Des McNulty: Trade  Justice&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises that global trade rules are weighted  against poor countries, their people and the environment; believes that  governments in poor countries should have the flexibility to choose those  policies that will help them to end poverty and protect the environment; notes  the Trade Justice Movement&rsquo;s mass lobby of the UK Parliament on 2 November  2005, and recognises that more than 600,000 people across the United Kingdom  have already voted for trade justice, an end to export dumping and regulations  that stop big business from profiting at the expense of people and the  environment.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3413 Ms Sandra White: European  Maritime Safety Agency - Glasgow  Bid&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the success of the Freedom of  Information (Scotland) Act 2002 which has ensured the release of information  about Glasgow&rsquo;s bid to be the new base of operations for the European Maritime  Safety Agency (EMSA); notes that the bid for the new EMSA headquarters has  since been awarded to Lisbon; notes that, at a meeting of heads of government,  Tony Blair did not table the Glasgow bid; notes that assurances were repeatedly  given to Scottish MPs and MSPs that the Glasgow bid was going ahead; notes that  Glasgow was even referred to as a part of the &ldquo;strong competition&rdquo; by Nicol Stephen in January 2004, despite the fact that  a civil servant said &ldquo;It is our understanding that securing the EMSA for the UK  is not the main objective. The preferred scenario seems to be to attract the  police training college to a location in England. Any bid for the EMSA would  not therefore proceed in the hope that it could be won, but rather so that it  could be tactically withdrawn later to boost the chances of getting the police  college&rdquo;; further notes that the Glasgow bid was never mentioned on the EMSA  website, which did mention Genoa, Nantes, Athens and Gothenburg as competitors  to Lisbon, and believes that it is clear from this information that the best  interests of Glasgow and Scotland are not being served by the UK Government or  the Scottish Executive.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3412 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Burma&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament condemns the illegal government of Burma in its  widespread abuse of human rights; calls on the relevant institutions, including  the UN Security Council, to act to stop the terror of the Burmese Government;  further condemns the overthrow of the previous democratically elected  government of Aung San Suu Kyi, and recognises the brutality inflicted on  ethnic groups, the use of forced labour and child soldiers and the huge numbers  of refugees created as a result of the actions of this regime.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3411 Mr Duncan  McNeil: Report on Prioritisation  of the Non-Executive Bills Unit&rsquo;s Workload&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament endorses the  prioritisation criteria set out in paragraphs 7 to 9 of the Scottish  Parliamentary Corporate Body&rsquo;s 2nd Report, 2005 (Session 2): <em>Report on the Prioritisation of the  Non-Executive Bills Unit&rsquo;s Workload</em> (SP Paper 434) and therefore agrees the  recommendations in paragraph 19 of the report.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3410 Margaret Jamieson: Guardian Public Services Awards Finalists  2005&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates Robin Gourlay, Head of Onsite  Services at East Ayrshire Council, and his school meals staff in being the only  Scottish finalists in this year&rsquo;s Guardian Public Services Awards in two  categories: Service Delivery &ndash; Children&rsquo;s Services and Innovation and Progress  - Customer Service and recognises the dedication of the school meals staff in  contributing to the successful revolution in school meals in East Ayrshire with  the roll-out of the organic and local produce pilot.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3409 Margaret Jamieson: Music  Award for East Ayrshire Council&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates  East Ayrshire Council on being awarded a national diploma by the National Music  Council and recognises the commitment and hard work of the pupils and staff of  East Ayrshire in gaining this award and being the only Scottish recipient.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3408 John Farquhar Munro: Condemnation of the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit&rsquo;s  Decision on Annat   Bay&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament condemns the decision of the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters  Unit recommending that the Crown Estate Commission approves the application for  a new salmon farm in Annat Bay, near Ullapool, overturning the democratic  decision taken by Highland Council after extensive consultation with the local  community; believes that it has made a mockery of the local democratic process  by ignoring the views of the local community and its right to manage the local  environment in its own way; notes that it is nearly three years since the  Parliament voted for planning controls for marine fish farms to be transferred  to local authorities; regrets the lack of urgency by the Scottish Executive in  bringing into force the relevant section in the Water Environment and Water  Services (Scotland) Act 2003, and calls on it to end the interim measures as  soon as possible and ensure that any decisions taken under interim arrangements  can be reviewed by the democratically elected local authorities.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3407 Des McNulty: Earthquake  in Kashmir&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament expresses  its deepest sympathy for the victims of the earthquake affecting Kashmir and  Pakistan&rsquo;s North-West Frontier Province which took place on Saturday 8 October  2005; recognises that many families in Scotland will have lost relatives and  friends as a result of the tragedy or are awaiting information about those who  are missing; congratulates Islamic Relief and other charitable organisations on  their swift response, and welcomes the steps taken by the UK Government to  provide urgent assistance to the affected areas.</p>
