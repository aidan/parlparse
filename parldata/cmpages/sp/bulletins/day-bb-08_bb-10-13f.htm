<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2707</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Funding for Gaelic Medium Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the continuation of support for Gaelic medium education, building on the work of the previous administration in securing the status of the Gaelic language and in funding the expansion of learning and teaching through the medium of Gaelic; believes that support for Gaelic medium education is the key to ensuring the survival of the language; recognises the campaigning efforts of parents across the country and the desire of those in Edinburgh, Fort William, Portree, Barra and elsewhere for stand-alone Gaelic medium schools to expand on the success of the existing Gaelic medium units; welcomes any additional capital funding to help build or refurbish these new schools but believes that recent announcements are insufficient and that the Scottish Government should match the example of the previous administration in the &pound;3.5 million of support given to Glasgow to establish an all Gaelic school, and believes that any funding commitment should last longer than just two or three years if it is to help secure the long-term future of the Gaelic language.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2706</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Sprinklers Save Lives</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Argyll and Bute Council has failed to install a sprinkler system in the new Hermitage Academy; expresses disappointment that it is the only education authority without sprinkler systems in each new school; notes that 50,250 fires were recorded and 52 people were killed by fires in Scotland in 2006; recognises the vital role that sprinkler systems may play in both maintaining the fabric of the buildings and, more importantly, the lives of the pupils and teachers, and calls on Argyll and Bute Council to consider retrospectively fitting a targeted system for the safety of all who attend Hermitage Academy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2705</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>When Do Three Cs Make a B?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the <em>Schools Estates Statistics 2008 </em>on 30 September 2008, which lists those schools considered to be in most need of substantial repair; expresses considerable surprise at the absence of Dumbarton Academy from that list given the condition of its school buildings; notes that the three buildings that make up the school campus have all been designated as category C, which is &quot;poor&quot;, and require almost &pound;2 million of investment in emergency repairs; further notes that the three Cs became a &quot;satisfactory B&quot; suggesting, at best, a degree of confusion; acknowledges that the rebuilding of Dumbarton Academy was dropped by West Dunbartonshire Council from the phase one schools regeneration programme and appears now to have been dropped from the SNP government&rsquo;s list of priorities; strongly believes that the time for woolly statements and promises of jam tomorrow from the SNP has now long passed, and calls on the Scottish Government to set out a clear timetable and funding path for the replacement of the school in the interests of this and future generations of young people in Dumbarton.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2704</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government Investment in Glasgow Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that Scotland is facing a housing crisis characterised by a severe shortage of good quality affordable homes; notes with concern that one of the most serious aspects of this crisis is the existence of slum housing, particularly in areas such as Govanhill in Glasgow; condemns the slum landlords that preside over this poor quality and overcrowded housing; welcomes the substantial funding by the Scottish Government for improving housing in the city, totalling &pound;177 million in 2008-09 alone, made up of &pound;93 million to Glasgow City Council for investment in the social and private housing sector and a further &pound;84 million paid directly to Glasgow Housing Association, and believes that this high level of investment will play a significant role in the effort to tackle the deep-seated housing problems, including slum housing, that afflict parts of Glasgow and should be welcomed by all with the city&rsquo;s best interests at heart.</p>
