<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3289</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Halting Wholesale School Closures in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns Glasgow City Council for its sudden and savage proposal to close 25 primary and nursery schools across the city; notes that the manner in which parents were notified led to many of them learning of the proposed closures in the Glasgow <em>Evening Times </em>and believes this is a totally unacceptable and insensitive way to impart such devastating news; believes that the consultation period of only six weeks for those objecting to the closures is far too short; is worried that any consultation will be for cosmetic purposes only and that the ruling Labour group may be determined to push school closures through in the face of huge public opposition; is concerned that such proposals may be an attempt to undermine the Scottish Government&rsquo;s efforts to reduce class sizes and threaten the capacity of some primary schools to deliver free school meals in primary school canteens to all primary one, two and three children; calls on Glasgow City Council to halt immediately the wholesale closure programme and enter into genuine and meaningful dialogue with parents, teachers, unions and communities before returning at a later date with a revised strategy to enhance primary education provision within the city, and insists that hard-pressed communities, such as those in Wyndford, Maryhill where two primary schools are set to close, are not left without educational provision in their community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3288</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Aiming for a Nuclear-free World and a Nuclear-free Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes President Obama&rsquo;s announcement of a strategic move towards a &quot;nuclear-free world&quot; through bilateral and multilateral disarmament; hopes to see the newly inaugurated president make good on this pledge in a constructive and practicable way, and believes that a fitting beginning to this new strategy necessitates the cessation of the shipment of vital bomb components by US weapons makers to the United Kingdom, historically sanctioned by US presidents, thus bringing about the end to the folly of Trident.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3287</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Scotswomen of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the finalists of the <em>Evening Times </em>Scotswoman of the Year Awards; recognises the huge contribution that all these women have made to the lives of others, their communities and Scotland; in particular congratulates the winners of the Scotswoman of the Year award, Jean Donnachie and Noreen Real, and, in celebrating the achievement of all these women, reaffirms its determination to act to ensure that women achieve their full potential and to tackle the inequalities that women continue to face in their daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3286</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the International Scotswoman of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Mary Miller on winning the <em>Evening Times</em> International Scotswoman of the Year award; acknowledges her long and sustained commitment to the people of Glasgow and in particular Castlemilk; celebrates the compassion, sacrifice and courage she displays in working with local communities in Zimbabwe, in particular supporting families facing HIV/AIDS, and considers that this award acknowledges this remarkable woman whose energy, humility and deep humanity offer a remarkable example of a life well lived in the service of others and who is an inspiration to us all.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3285</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Scots Sportswoman of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aileen McGlynn on winning the <em>Evening Times </em>Scots Sportswoman of the Year award in recognition of her stunning success in winning two cycling gold medals at the Paralympics in Beijing; notes the pride of her community in Cardonald, Glasgow, and of all of Scotland in her success; salutes her as a fabulously talented role model for young women to encourage their involvement in sport, and celebrates the powerful message her victory represents to all those who face barriers through disability or disadvantage about what can be achieved with grit, determination and ambition.</p>
