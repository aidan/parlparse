          <p align="CENTER"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
          <p>9:30 am&#9;Debate on Closing the Opportunity Gap&#151;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-293</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Closing 
            the Opportunity Gap</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the 
            Executive's continuing commitment to breaking down the social, educational 
            and economic barriers that create inequality and the commitment to 
            working to end poverty by tackling deprivation and social needs, and 
            notes that to close the opportunity gap the Executive will deliver 
            community regeneration to build strong, safe and attractive communities; 
            measures to increase financial inclusion to reduce debt, measures 
            to improve standards of housing and to tackle homelessness and measures 
            to overcome barriers to training and employment to increase participation 
            in the labour market. </p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-293.3</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Closing the Opportunity 
            Gap</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-293) in the name 
            of Ms Margaret Curran, insert at end "but recognises that none of 
            this action will be enough to reduce poverty levels in Scotland, which 
            will only be achieved once the Executive has power and control over 
            tax and social security policy." </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-293.1</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Closing the Opportunity 
            Gap</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-293) in the name 
            of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert 
            "notes with concern that waiting lists are getting longer, children 
            are failing to meet education attainment levels, violent crime is 
            increasing, anti-social behaviour is rising and our economy is lagging 
            behind that of the rest of the United Kingdom; recognises that it 
            is the poorest and most vulnerable in society that suffer most as 
            they are trapped in failing schools, most likely to suffer from ill 
            health and most likely to be victims of crime, and believes ultimately 
            that only by reforming key public services through offering choice 
            and decentralisation, whilst encouraging economic growth by cutting 
            business rates, removing red tape and mutualising Scottish Water, 
            can we close any opportunity gap and give the people of Scotland a 
            better future. </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-293.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Closing the Opportunity 
            Gap</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-293) in the name 
            of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert 
            "condemns the failure of the Scottish Executive's policy over the 
            last four years to deal with the problem of poverty in Scotland; notes 
            the findings of the recent Rowntree report on poverty and social inclusion 
            which shows that the proportion of the population living in poverty 
            in Scotland has risen to 23% and the proportion of children in poverty 
            to 30%; believes that the problem of poverty will never be solved 
            until there is a fundamental redistribution of income and wealth which 
            requires an independent Scotland, but considers, however, that even 
            with its limited power the Parliament could begin this process by 
            abolishing regressive council tax and introducing a Scottish service 
            tax based on people's ability to pay and, in addition, introduce a 
            minimum wage in the public sector of £7.50 an hour and free, nutritious 
            school meals for all state school children in Scotland." </p>

          <p><strong>S2M-264</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Defence 
            Aviation Repair Agency, Almondbank</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the continued speculation about the impact of the Ministry of 
            Defence&#146;s &#145;End to End Review&#146; on the future of the 
            Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) in Almondbank; is concerned 
            about the threat to the 325 jobs at the facility; recognises the important 
            and specialised skills of the workforce there which are significant 
            to both Perthshire locally and Scotland as a whole; acknowledges the 
            massive local economic impact of DARA in Almondbank as evidenced by 
            the Mackay Consultants&#146; report of August 2003; further notes 
            the cross party and multi-agency Welsh campaign to defend DARA jobs 
            in Wales, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that 
            a similar campaign is organised in Scotland in order to protect and 
            defend the continued existence of defence jobs at DARA in Almondbank.
