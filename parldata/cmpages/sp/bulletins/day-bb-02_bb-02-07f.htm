          <p><strong>*S1M-2715</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: The Scottish 
            Arts Council and VisitScotland Traditional Music and Tourism Initiative 
            2002</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the 
            joint Scottish Arts Council and VisitScotland document <em>A Soundtrack 
            for Scottish Tourism</em> which describes a variety of pilot projects 
            operating in a number of different areas throughout Scotland from 
            1999 to 2002; notes the widespread local, national and international 
            interest shown in each project; further notes that the effect on all 
            local areas involved included clear business and tourism benefits 
            in both the short and longer term; recognises the uniqueness of Scotland's 
            traditional culture and the enormous contribution it can make to revitalising 
            the tourist sector and, in particular, the rural economy, and calls 
            on all local authorities to investigate ways in which they can further 
            encourage traditional culture in their respective areas.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2714#</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: British Trade 
            Ban on Israel</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continued incursions 
            by the Israeli defence forces into areas controlled by the Palestinian 
            Authority and believes that Her Majesty's Government should cease 
            all trade with Israel until the Israeli Government complies with United 
            Nations Resolution 242.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2712#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Treefest Scotland 
            2002</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Treefest Scotland 2002 
            is a year-long programme of events to celebrate Scotland's trees, 
            woods and forests; recognises the contribution of these trees, woods 
            and forests to our natural and cultural heritage and to our environmental 
            and economic wellbeing; congratulates the Forestry Commission and 
            other partner organisations who are working to deliver a programme 
            of events throughout 2002, and welcomes Treefest Scotland 2002's aims 
            to raise awareness of the range, nature and economic and cultural 
            benefits of Scotland's trees, woods and forests and to increase people's 
            use, knowledge, understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of Scotland's 
            trees, woods and forests.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2711</strong> <strong>Des McNulty: UN 0.7% GNP Target 
            for Development Assistance</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            the economic consequences of the tragic events of 11 September 2001 
            will have severe and adverse impacts on developing countries, particularly 
            sub-Sahara Africa; recognises the commitment by international institutions 
            and Her Majesty's Government to the goal of halving the proportion 
            of people living in extreme poverty by 2015; shares the concerns raised 
            by the World Bank and others that without significantly increased 
            development assistance many countries will fail to reach this goal; 
            praises the actions by the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Denmark 
            for consistently achieving the UN 0.7% GNP target for development 
            assistance over many years, and congratulates Luxembourg for achieving 
            the target in 2000 and Portugal and Ireland for setting dates to achieve 
            the target, in 2006 and 2007 respectively; recognises the principle 
            that successful poverty reduction is an essential foundation of stability 
            in an increasingly globalised world; believes that the adoption of 
            an intermediate target of 0.4% for overseas development assistance 
            by 2006 with the goal of achieving the UN 0.7% GNP target by 2012 
            would strengthen the United Kingdom's advocacy role; welcomes the 
            leadership shown by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, 
            and the Secretary of State for International Development, Claire Short, 
            in establishing a Commonwealth Education Fund to support disadvantaged 
            children in Commonwealth countries, and commends the work of those 
            charities and agencies in Scotland who not only take forward development 
            work in many of the poorer countries but also play a vital role in 
            informing the Scottish people about the importance of development 
            assistance.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2710#</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell: Establishment 
            of Task Force for the Regeneration of Inverclyde</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes with concern the Registrar General's prediction of 
            decline in the population of Inverclyde between 2001 and 2016, the 
            highest predicted depopulation of Scotland's 32 council areas; recognises 
            that a main cause of this depopulation is lack of job opportunities; 
            believes that this decline places an intolerable burden on the remaining 
            population in terms of council tax and service delivery, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should establish a task force with the 
            resources to address the problems facing Inverclyde, with a view to 
            reversing decline through regeneration and restoring prosperity.</p>

            Research UK as a result of the merger between the Imperial Cancer 
            Research Fund and the Cancer Research Campaign; recognises the unique 
            and essential contribution to cancer research and therapies made by 
            both charities, and, following the creation of Cancer Research UK, 
            welcomes the expansion of specialist trials centres in NHS hospitals.</p>

            the performance of the operating companies to ensure compliance with 
            their contractual obligations, and further invites the Executive to 
            enter into dialogue with local authorities to assess the effects of 
            the contracts on local roads maintenance.&quot; </p>

            of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end 
            and insert &quot;supports the principle of competitive tendering in 
            relation to public works contracts, such as the contract for trunk 
            roads management and maintenance, in view of the paramount importance 
            of securing best value for the taxpayer at both local and national 
            levels; notes concerns raised in respect of the operation of the trunk 
            road maintenance contracts by BEAR Scotland Ltd and Amey Highways 
            Ltd; calls upon the Scottish Executive to produce a report on the 
            performance of each company, as recommended by the Auditor General 
            for Scotland; further notes concern about the level of non-trunk road 
            maintenance being carried out by local authorities, and further calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to (a) review and report to the Parliament 
            on the implications of disaggregation of trunk and local services 
            for local authorities and (b) set up a system for (i) monitoring and

            in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from &quot;increasing&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;that the reduction in class sizes in Primary 
            1 to Primary 3 to 18 would involve a substantial revenue cost and 
            an unquantifiable capital cost together with a removal of parental 
            choice; acknowledges that class size is only one aspect of educational 
            provision which may help to improve standards in Scotland's schools, 
            and considers that greater devolution of decision making to teachers 
            and parents should be the goal of the Scottish Executive.</p>

            recognises that education is about developing individuals to their 
            full potential, and considers that the Scottish Executive should continue
