          <p><strong>*S1M-3671</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Criminal Justice 
            Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the 
            provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill that relate to devolved matters 
            should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3670</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Crime (International 
            Co-operation) Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the need for the United Kingdom to ensure compliance with the international 
            obligations for which the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill 
            makes provision and agrees that those provisions in the bill that 
            relate to devolved matters should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3669</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Single MMR Vaccines</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates Direct Remedies for providing single 
            mumps, measles and rubella vaccines, thereby offering parents a choice 
            in the treatment of their children which is currently denied them 
            by the Scottish Executive, and believes that, while doubt remains 
            surrounding the 3-in-1 MMR vaccine and its possible link to the diagnosis 
            of autistic spectrum disorders, the Scottish Executive should reconsider 
            its position of denying the single vaccines to children on the NHS, 
            whilst also taking the necessary action to ensure that all possible 
            causes of autistic spectrum disorders are examined in the light of 
            the staggering increase in the incidence of autistic spectrum disorders, 
            previously a rare disease.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3668</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Glasgow Victim 
            Support Drop-In Centre</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the 
            very real problem of city centre crime; notes that 15% of crime in 
            Glasgow take place in the city centre; welcomes the unique new Victim 
            Support 24 hour drop-in centre to provide practical assistance and 
            emotional support for victims of assault and muggings which opened 
            on 25 November 2002 in Glasgow's Saltmarket, and encourages victims 
            of crime to use the centre, particularly those groups including homeless 
            people, lesbian, gay and bisexual victims and others who tend not 
            to report crimes. </p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3667</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Cancer, Stroke 
            and Heart Disease Research at University of Glasgow</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the £1 million awarded to the University of 
            Glasgow to carry out research into cancer, stroke and heart disease.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3666#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: London Weighting 
            Allowance and Relocation of Civil Service Posts to Aberdeen</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes recent calls to increase the London weighting 
            allowance and considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations 
            to Her Majesty's Government discouraging such a proposal and seeking 
            further dispersal of civil service posts throughout the UK, especially 
            the relocation of the remaining Department of Trade and Industry positions 
            that deal with the oil and gas industry to Aberdeen.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3665</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Local Authority Housing 
            Stock - Aberdeen</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">congratulates 
            the local authority tenants of Aberdeen on their emphatic decision 
            to retain local authority housing in the recent ballot; condemns the 
            waste of resources by Aberdeen City Council in conducting this exercise, 
            despite the previously acknowledged consensus opinion of tenants in 
            favour of the chosen option; calls on the Scottish Executive to abandon 
            its ill-advised policy on large-scale voluntary transfer of council 
            housing stock, and endorses the call for Aberdeen to be given prudential 
            borrowing powers to improve the standards and numbers of affordable 
            council houses in Aberdeen.</a></p>
