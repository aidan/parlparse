<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1790</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Youth Buzz in North Lanarkshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the young people involved in the launch of Youth Buzz, the new youth council for North Lanarkshire; recognises the hard work and endeavour of Youth Buzz in creating this exciting new representative body for young people in North Lanarkshire; further recognises the high level of participation in the vote for MSYPs in North Lanarkshire, where 10,000 people voted, and wishes members of Youth Buzz success in their efforts to improve the lives of young people in North Lanarkshire.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1789</strong> <strong>Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Closure of JVC Facility in East Kilbride</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by JVC to close its East Kilbride electronics plant with the loss of 300 local jobs and an additional 60 agency jobs as production will shift to eastern Europe; is alarmed at the lack of transparency, accountability and consultation afforded to the workforce by the company, as news of the closure was given at a canteen meeting called by management; notes that the closure of the plant was preceded by the loss of 99 jobs in September 2007; calls on the Scottish Government to act immediately to support manufacturing in Scotland and ensure that redundant workers are re-employed at the earliest opportunity, and supports the efforts of Unite the Union to secure the best possible benefits for the workforce.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1788</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Essentials for the Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in light of the threat to Scotland&rsquo;s fuel supplies because of the dispute at the Grangemouth refinery which has the potential to have a devastating impact on the Scottish economy and day-to-day lives of ordinary people and the monopolistic private ownership of other key national resources, such as the distribution of gas and electricity, considers that, at the very least, legislation should be put in place, after widespread consultation, with an option of public ownership of these assets, in order to secure continuity of supply in the interests of the people and economy of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1787&diams; </strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Tackling Excess Packaging</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the innovation and success of the state-of-the-art Eco Deco waste treatment plant near Dumfries which is the first facility of its kind in Scotland; notes that by using advanced technology the plant can process up to 65,000 tonnes of waste a year, recovering resources from waste and eliminating the need for several kerbside boxes and bags as well as wheeled bins; regrets that the UK&rsquo;s levels of waste production are increasing exponentially, with approximately one million tonnes of packaging waste produced in Scotland each year; notes that, although packaging regulations are largely reserved to Westminster, waste management including waste minimisation and recycling are devolved to Scotland, and therefore believes that tackling excess packaging should be a central objective of the forthcoming supermarket summit and that decisive action should be taken to reduce excess packaging through all available levers, including working with product designers and manufacturers in Scotland to encourage sustainable design and sustainable products, developing improved packaging guidelines for adoption by retailers and their suppliers, introducing further Producer Responsibility initiatives and installing ambitious recovery obligations in the producer responsibility regulations for packaging, developing improved systems for consumers to complain to retailers and Trading Standards officers about excess packaging, and that waste points should be provided in supermarkets where customers can deposit unwanted packaging.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1786</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Human Rights and the Olympic Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its best wishes to all athletes attending the forthcoming Olympic Games in Beijing; remembers the words of the then Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Liu Jingmin, in 2001 that &quot;By applying for the Olympics, we want to promote not just the city&rsquo;s development but the development of society, including democracy and human rights&quot;; expresses grave concerns that, in the years since, the recognition of the human rights of Chinese citizens does not appear to have notably progressed towards the standard defined by the United Nations&rsquo; Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, while accepting that the Games should go ahead, calls on all those who are able to remind the Chinese Government of its previously stated commitments on improving human rights.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1771</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Stop the Rip-off</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing number of people who fall victim to multimillion pound text messaging scams by international spammers; is aware that gangs outwith the European Union exploit loopholes in mobile company contracts under which consumers agree to send and receive texts and agree to pay the bill; is aware that the agreement of mobile phone users to pay for texts received is often something that they are completely unaware of; believes that mobile phone users should only be charged for calls actually made rather than received; considers that it is a nonsense that when Ofcom adjudicates on cases and mobile companies have to refund customers only individual customers who specifically complain are refunded, minimising any deterrent effect, and is of the view that the Scottish Government should liaise with Ofcom, Westminster and the European Union to stop this problem and ensure that mobile phone users pay only for texts sent rather than those received.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1770</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>The SNP&rsquo;s Real 10p Tax</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 10p rise in Lothian Buses standard adult fare to &pound;1.10 and the recent findings of the Competition Commission on bus subsidies; believes that this rise, and those of other bus operators across the Lothians, are principally due to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision not to pass on to Scottish bus operators the fuel duty rebate which the UK Government has provided for bus operators in England; notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget indicates that no further fuel duty will be rebated in the next three years, meaning that bus passengers in Scotland will effectively pay a greater amount of tax on their journeys than passengers elsewhere in the United Kingdom; regrets the extra expense and inconvenience this fare rise will cause passengers at a time when the Scottish Government claims to be encouraging greater use of public transport and hopes that this fare increase is not an omen for the abolition of the national concessionary travel scheme for the over 60s which the Scottish Government is currently reviewing, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to rule this out at the earliest opportunity, to reassure passengers that any cap on future funding for the scheme will not put more pressure on fare-paying passengers and to reverse its decision not to follow the example of the UK Government and to protect bus passengers from rising fuel costs.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1744</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Arms Shipment to Zimbabwe and Interference in a Country&rsquo;s Internal Affairs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the statement by  the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (SATAWU), that it would be &quot;grossly irresponsible&quot; to allow a shipment of Chinese weapons through to Zimbabwe and that &quot;the South African government cannot be seen as propping up a military regime&quot;; applauds South African dock workers for refusing to unload the ship bearing the weapons; is in agreement with the government of China that &quot;one of the most important principles is not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries&quot; but is of the opinion that providing the present government of Zimbabwe with the means of thwarting the democratically expressed wishes of its people would constitute unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of another country and that China&rsquo;s longstanding support of Mugabe&rsquo;s brutal and anti-democratic regime also constitutes such interference; believes that the actions and statements of SATAWU and the Southern Africa Litigation Centre are representative of the wishes of the majority of the people of Zimbabwe, and calls on all governments, but particularly those of the countries of Southern Africa, to do what they can to ensure that the wishes of these people be respected and assist the peaceful transfer of power to a democratically elected government.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1580#</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Fenwick Weavers&rsquo; Society and the Co-operative Model</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that&nbsp;the Fenwick Weavers&rsquo; Society is increasingly being acknowledged as the world&rsquo;s first formally incorporated co-operative society; recognises that having been founded on 14 March&nbsp;1761 to promote and maintain high standards in the craft of weaving, it also became involved in the bulk purchase of oatmeal for resale to its members and in lending money to needy members and their families, setting examples followed in the development of both the retail co-operative sector and credit unions; notes that the deed of incorporation and the minute book of the society covering the period 1761 to 1783 are in the safe-keeping of the National Library of Scotland; welcomes the decision of the library to make the deed of incorporation and minute book available to the residents of Fenwick who, under the inspired leadership of John Smith and John McFadzean, have re-established the society to develop a heritage centre in&nbsp;Fenwick to value and build on the work of the society, and records its support for the co-operative model of working, which has the potential to make a significant contribution to the economic and social development of Scotland and the wider world.</p>
