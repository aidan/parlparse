          <p><strong>*S2M-1420</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Gardening 
            Scotland 2004 - 4 to 6 June</strong>-That the Parliament wishes the 
            Gardening Scotland 2004 event at the Royal Highland Centre at Ingliston 
            every success; congratulates the organisers on attracting 400 exhibitors 
            to what is Scotland's biggest gardening exhibition; notes that over 
            30,000 visitors are expected to attend the event; acknowledges the 
            many benefits of gardening, particularly in keeping older people active, 
            and recognises the important contribution that horticulture makes 
            to the Scottish economy.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1419</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Crisis 
            FareShare</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the valuable contribution 
            made by the two existing Crisis FareShare projects in Scotland, whose 
            network of volunteers collects and redistributes surplus fresh food 
            from manufacturers and retail outlets to centres and shelters for 
            homeless people; notes the direct benefits of these projects in providing 
            nutritious food to homeless people while helping to minimise food 
            waste and its subsequent disposal to landfill sites; recognises the 
            additional benefits of such schemes in allowing resources to be diverted 
            into vital counselling, resettlement and other support services and 
            in encouraging homeless people to gain social contact and new skills 
            by participating as volunteers; commends the scheme as an excellent 
            example of socially and environmentally responsible partnership between 
            food manufacturers and the voluntary sector, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to make a firm financial commitment to ensure the continuation 
            of existing projects and the further development of fareshare initiatives 
            across Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1418</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Tolled 
            Bridges</strong>-That the Parliament notes the comments by the Deputy 
            First Minister and Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in 
            the debate on the economy of the Highlands and Islands on Thursday 
            3 June 2004: &quot;However, I reaffirm and reassure members and John 
            Farquhar Munro that the Executive is committed to ending the discredited 
            tolling regime on the Skye Bridge. Professional advisers have been 
            appointed and discussions with Skye Bridge Ltd have already begun. 
            Having conferred with the Minister for Transport on the issue in anticipation 
            of such a question, I believe that we can achieve our goal by the 
            end of this year.&quot; (<em>Official Report</em>, c 8834 - 35) and 
            seeks assurances from the Scottish Executive that, if the tolls on 
            the Skye Bridge are lifted in the timescale suggested, tolls on the 
            Erskine Bridge and other tolled bridges are lifted simultaneously 
            in the interest of consistency and fairness.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1417</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>D-Day 
            Commemoration and the Treatment of Veterans and Widows</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the First Minister on his decision to 
            attend the D-Day 60th anniversary remembrance ceremony on the Normandy 
            beaches; hopes that he takes this opportunity to remind the Prime 
            Minister, Tony Blair, that far too many of the D-Day veterans and 
            the immediate relatives of those who gave their lives for our democracy 
            are currently living below the Government's own poverty level and 
            that this generation is entitled to much more than a free television 
            license on reaching 75 years old or a 25p increase in their pension 
            on reaching the age of 80 years old, and therefore believes that it 
            is unacceptable in 2004 that Scotland is still not a land where heroes 
            can afford to live with the dignity that was earned by the ultimate 
            sacrifices paid during World War Two.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1416#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> 
            <strong>International Refugee Week</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that 14 to 20 June 2004 is International Refugee Week; welcomes the 
            great social, cultural and economic benefits that refugees have brought 
            to Scotland over the years; recognises that they continue to bring 
            these benefits and in many instances arrive in Scotland as a result 
            of war, and destitution caused thereby; notes that events are taking 
            place worldwide to mark the week, and welcomes the establishment of 
            the Edinburgh Refugee Centre at St George's West Church in Shandwick 
            Place, Edinburgh, providing humanitarian support, advice and assistance 
            for refugees and asylum seekers.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1415</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Belmont 
            Academy Parliament Success</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the pupils and staff of Belmont Academy in Ayr for winning the National 
            Youth Parliament competition, Holyrood Model, where the pupils took 
            on roles of MSPs and conducted their own parliamentary sessions, bringing 
            to life the process of parliament and devolved government.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1413#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Assault 
            on Lanarkshire NHS</strong>-That the Parliament is extremely concerned 
            at the announcement by NHS Lanarkshire that it will make cuts of between 
            5 and 10% of its budget this year in order to address a projected 
            deficit of £20 million; is alarmed that the Scottish Executive refused 
            to assist in avoiding such draconian measures by insisting that the 
            board reach financial balance this year and by rejecting the board's 
            proposals for a two-year recovery plan; notes concern that legislation 
            and changes to be made by the Executive to consultant contracts, the 
            new deal for junior doctors, the new GP contract and other such initiatives 
            have not been fully funded by the Executive's allocation to NHS boards, 
            thereby putting the service under intolerable strain; believes that 
            the Executive should take immediate steps to avoid cuts in NHS Lanarkshire 
            by making adequate funding available; believes that the two PFI hospitals 
            at Hairmyres and Wishaw have placed unacceptable pressure on the board's 
            revenue budget to the detriment of patient care and have led directly 
            to bed cuts, reduced staffing levels and threats to the level of services 
            provided from the non-PFI hospital at Monklands whilst the PFI consortia 
            rake in huge profits; condemns specifically the consortia responsible 
            for the Hairmyres PFI who are additionally set to benefit to the tune 
            of nearly £1 billion from a re-financing deal, and believes that PFI 
            is a wasteful means of funding public building projects, that it only 
            benefits banks and big business and should be abolished and that all 
            public buildings should be financed via direct public funding and 
            the public works loan board.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1412</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            First Division Champions</strong>-That the Parliament fully condemns 
            the decision taken on 1 June 2004 by the Scottish Premier League (SPL) 
            to deny Scottish First Division champions, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, 
            entry into Scotland's top league next season, meaning that, for the 
            second successive year, the team finishing bottom of the SPL has not 
            been relegated and the First Division winners have not been rewarded 
            for their success by rightfully gaining promotion to the SPL; notes 
            that this is despite the club reaching a suitable ground-sharing agreement 
            with Aberdeen Football Club to play at Pittodrie Stadium for one season, 
            and believes that the decision takes away the basic principle of being 
            rewarded for success.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, 
            Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1411</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Borders 
            Voluntary Community Care Forum</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the sterling work of Scotland's countless volunteers and notes the 
            contribution of Borders Voluntary Community Care Forum, with representatives 
            from Alzheimer Scotland-Action on Dementia, Borders Independent Advocacy 
            Service, Borderline, Borders Local Health Council, Borders Carers 
            Centre, the Disabled Persons Housing Service, Borders Visual Impairment 
            Network, the British Red Cross, Encompass, Gala Day Services, New 
            Horizons Borders, Penumbra Youth Project, People First Borders and 
            Scottish Borders Elder Council and also the contribution of individual 
            members; notes its mission statement &quot;to represent the views 
            of all those with an interest in community care to the agencies responsible 
            for the planning and provision of community care services in the Scottish 
            Borders&quot;, and congratulates it on another successful year's work 
            on behalf of Borders users and carers.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1410#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Increasing 
            Gender Pay Gap</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            result of research by PayFinder.com which indicates that the gender 
            pay gap is getting wider, that it has increased by 5% in the last 
            year and that the gap is now 29% in Scotland and believes that this 
            is an unacceptable situation and that the Scottish Executive has a 
            duty to investigate the matter and bring forward proposals to close 
            the gap.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1409#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Food Train, Dumfries and Galloway - Queen's Award for Voluntary 
            Service 2004</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Food Train, 
            Dumfries and Galloway, on being one of the 110 organisations in the 
            United Kingdom to be awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service 
            on 1 June 2004; notes the expansion of its operations delivering groceries 
            to elderly and disabled people throughout Dumfries and Galloway over 
            the last year and the training and experience being offered to its 
            increasing numbers of volunteers; further congratulates the Food Train 
            on the introduction of its services in Dalkeith, Midlothian, and looks 
            forward to similar services being established throughout Scotland.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1408</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Kirkcudbright 
            Academy Junior Debating Champions</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Kirkcudbright Academy debating team and its coach on winning the 
            National Junior Debating Competition, sponsored by the English Speaking 
            Union, particularly as this was the first time the academy had entered 
            this prestigious competition which receives entries from all over 
            Scotland, and notes that the team was commended for showing &quot;maturity 
            beyond its tender years&quot; and a level of debating skills that 
            completely belied the school's previous experience in debating.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1406#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Reserved 
            Contracts to Support Remploy</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the work of Remploy in Scotland in supporting 700 people with special 
            needs in employment and congratulates the organisation on its training 
            and development programme which has seen the creation of dedicated 
            learning rooms at all 10 of its employment sites, with 275 employees 
            currently undertaking skills training in language and mathematics 
            and a further 135 involved in other learning activity, and a commitment 
            of at least 5% of working time over a year to be dedicated to personal 
            development; notes that this programme has been implemented in just 
            over two years, and believes that the Scottish Executive and all publicly-funded 
            organisations should examine their procurement policies with a view 
            to reserving contracts for supported employment organisations such 
            as those working with Remploy.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1405</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Norway's 
            Ban on Smoking in Public Places</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Norway on its decision to ban smoking in all public places; notes 
            that the proposal comes after heavy pressure from restaurant workers' 
            unions who say that their members have a higher incidence of lung 
            cancer than others due to passive smoking and that the Norwegian Health 
            Ministry states that between 300 and 500 people die of passive smoking 
            in Norway each year; notes that, even before the ban came into force, 
            the smoking rates had dropped from 29% to 26%, suggesting that many 
            smokers are looking for a reason to give up smoking and that a ban 
            such as this assists them in doing so, and recommends that members 
            follow the example set by Norway by supporting such measures as the 
            Prohibition of Smoking in Regulated Areas (Scotland) Bill to protect 
            the health of both workers and patrons of eating establishments.</P>

            Football Supporters Against the Scottish Premier League</strong>-That

            (SPL) to accept First Division Champions, Inverness Caledonian Thistle 
            Football Club, as being entitled to promotion to the SPL is unfair 
            and unreasonable and urges every MSP to register concern by signing 
            the on-line petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/spl/petition.html 
            set up by the fans of Inverness Caledonian Thistle which reads: &quot;Scottish

            notes that, in preparation for deployment, he received nine vaccinations 
            in 24 hours, and that since 1993 he has suffered ill-health, including 
            autoimmune osteoporosis which a 2003 court ruling found was caused 
            by this &quot;concoction of drugs&quot;; further notes that many other 
            veterans have suffered similar ill-health and even death, and calls

            the Parliament condemns the Israeli Government's treatment of Mordechai 
            Vanunu who was released from prison on 21 April 2004 after being held 
            in prison for 18 years, 11 of which were in solitary confinement, 
            for revealing the existence of the Israeli secret nuclear weapons 
            programme; furthermore strongly opposes restrictions placed upon Mr 
            Vanunu by the Israeli Government whereby Mr Vanunu is not allowed 
            to leave the country, visit any embassy or speak to foreigners or 
            media; believes that it is ironic that Mr Vanunu was jailed for exposing 
            secret weapons of mass destruction whilst Iraq was attacked and occupied 
            for supposedly not revealing weapons of mass destruction; considers 
            that the First Minister should write to Ariel Sharon inviting Mr Vanunu 
            to Scotland, a safe haven where he can live in freedom and safety 
            having suffered long enough as a result of his brave stance in relation 
            to weapons of mass destruction and the Israeli Government's secret 
            programme; notes that should Mr Vanunu reach these shores it would 
            not be appropriate to hold him in Dungavel House Immigration and Removal 
            Centre, and supports the Scottish Socialist Party in taking this initiative 
            if the First Minister feels that for any reason he cannot.</P>

            condemns its action in previous years in preventing Falkirk Football 
            Club from entering the SPL; believes that this decision brings Scottish 
            football into disrepute by offending the basic principle of advancement 
            on merit, and calls on the SPL to reconsider its decision and agree 
            to Inverness Caledonian Thistle joining the SPL in the coming season 
            and to the lifting of 10,000 seat stadium criterion so allowing home
