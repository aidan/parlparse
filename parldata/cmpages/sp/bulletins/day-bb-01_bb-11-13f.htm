          <p><strong>*S1M-2438</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon: Renewing Mental 
            Health Law</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of 
            the Executive&#146;s policy statement <i>Renewing Mental Health Law</i>; 
            agrees that the statement provides a sound framework for new legislation 
            which responds to the needs, rights and aspirations of people who 
            use mental health services, while having regard to the public interest, 
            and looks forward to the introduction of a Mental Health Bill, thus 
            fulfilling the Programme for Government commitment to modernise mental 
            health legislation in the light of the Millan Committee&#146;s review 
            of existing law.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Malcolm Chisholm*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2437</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: Internet 
            Access</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern that, according 
            to a MORI survey conducted for Oftel, the number of households in 
            the UK with access to the internet has fallen for the first time, 
            from 40% to 39% of households, welcomes the slight increase in the 
            proportion of Scottish homes with internet access, but regrets that 
            the Scottish figure is only 29%, which is still 10% lower than the 
            UK average; recognises the critical role that the internet plays in 
            promoting business and as a key access tool for vulnerable groups; 
            notes that these vulnerable groups are still lagging behind the general 
            population with regard to internet access, the number of households 
            with annual incomes lower than £17,500 with internet access having 
            dropped from 21% to 19%; welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s <i>Digital 
            Communities</i> initiative, but believes that the Executive should 
            ensure that all low income and other vulnerable groups in Scotland 
            are given every opportunity to connect to the internet, particularly 
            by encouraging the use of fixed-price packages, in order to ensure 
            that technology in the 21st century narrows the social and digital 
            divide rather than expanding it.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2436#</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Digital Hearing 
            Aids and Review of Audiology Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that the Scottish Executive is conducting an audiology services 
            review; recognises that many hard of hearing and profoundly deaf people 
            are still provided with out-dated analogue hearing aids; is aware 
            that new digital hearing aids can improve the quality of life for 
            those who need them; realises that digital hearing aids are not widely 
            available on the NHS in Scotland and are expensive to purchase privately; 
            understands that the cost can be dramatically reduced by a system 
            of bulk-buying; further notes that such a scheme has been introduced 
            into 20 NHS hospitals in England, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should make a commitment to provide digital hearing aids 
            on the NHS in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2435#</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson: European Day 
            of Disabled People: 3 December 2001</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            the European Day of Disabled People on 3 December 2001; recognises 
            the contribution made by people with disabilities to Scottish society; 
            further notes with concern the continuing exclusion of disabled people 
            from full participation within our society due to barriers created 
            by poor design and inaccessible buildings in towns and cities across 
            Scotland, and supports the principle of &quot;Design for All&quot; 
            by asking the Holyrood Progress Group to ensure that the new Parliament 
            building at Holyrood is accessible to all.</a></p>
