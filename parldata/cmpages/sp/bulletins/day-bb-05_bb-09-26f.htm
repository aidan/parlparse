<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only  printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the  complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is  published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains any motions lodged  for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate  as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (u).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a  declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3339# Euan Robson: South  of Scotland Structural Funds&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the  investment in Roxburgh and Berwickshire, the Borders and the south of Scotland  from EU structural funding, such as at Springwood Park in Kelso and at Ettrick  Riverside in Selkirk; notes that the current round of such funding ends in  March 2006, and believes that the south of Scotland has a clear case for  continuing investment to support its economy and communities.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3338 Mr Mark Ruskell: Ship-to-Ship Oil Transfer in the Firth of Forth&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament  notes the application by Melbourne Marine Services to introduce ship-to-ship  transfer of heavy crude oil at deep water anchorages in the Firth of Forth;  acknowledges the devastating impact on the ecology and economy of the Forth  estuary that would occur in the event of a heavy oil spill; further notes the  suspension of heavy oil transfers in 2004 at Lyme Bay in Dorset following  concerns voiced by local authorities, and calls on the Maritime and Coastguard  Agency to heed the concerns of Fife Council, the City of Edinburgh Council  and&nbsp; East Lothian Council by rejecting  the application for heavy oil transfer in the Firth of Forth.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3337 Fergus Ewing: Inverness Harbour&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the Inverness Harbour Trust on its continuing success, as  shown in its recent annual report for the year to September 2004; believes that  the port is vital to the economic well-being of the city of Inverness; welcomes  the expansion plans which have been brought forward by the trustees, as  outlined in the annual report, and hopes that the plans will be translated into  reality.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3336 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Financial Straits Faced by Dairy Farmers&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament recognises the dire financial straits faced by Scotland&rsquo;s dairy  farmers; acknowledges the financial constraints placed on them by the large  companies wielding too much power and pursuing a completely blinkered  short-term buying policy, and calls on the Scottish Executive to intervene in  the supply chain to compel major processors and supermarkets to adopt a  long-term perspective that protects supplies and dairy farmers.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3335# Mr Duncan McNeil: Jimmy Cowan, The Prince of Goalkeepers&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes  the nomination by the Greenock Morton Supporters&rsquo; Trust of legendary  goalkeeper, Jimmy Cowan, for induction into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame;  welcomes the enthusiastic backing which the bid has already received from the  people of Greenock and Inverclyde and <em>The Greenock Telegraph</em>; notes that  the 25 international caps that Cowan won during his illustrious career included  the 3-1 win over England at Wembley in 1949, in which his heroic performance  led to its being dubbed &ldquo;Cowan&rsquo;s Match&rdquo;, and therefore considers that the  Scottish football authorities should look beyond the usual suspects of the Old  Firm when they come to consider on whom should be bestowed this most prestigious  of honours and elevate &ldquo;The Prince of Goalkeepers&rdquo; to where he belongs.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3334 Margaret Jamieson: 40th Anniversary of Ataxia UK&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament congratulates Ataxia UK on its 40th anniversary on 25 September 2005  and commends Louise Hunter of Kilmarnock who has written a book entitled <em>Hey, I&rsquo;m Alive </em>which describes her life  as a sufferer of Friedreich&rsquo;s Ataxia, the proceeds of which will be donated to  the continuing research by Ataxia UK into neurological disorders and to the  information and support it provides to sufferers and their families.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3325# Mr Kenny MacAskill: HMV/Waterstones Takeover of Ottakar&rsquo;s Book  Stores&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament voices its grave concern over, and opposition  to, the proposed takeover of Ottakar&rsquo;s book stores by HMV/Waterstones; notes  that, if the takeover goes ahead, there will be effectively a monopoly on  bookselling in many towns and cities in Scotland; regrets that, despite  Edinburgh being the World City of Literature, in recent times it has witnessed  the demise of independent Scottish-owned book stores such as Bauermeister and  James Thin, meaning that there is now no Scottish-owned book chain in Edinburgh  or indeed Scotland; recognises that the internal structure of Ottakar&rsquo;s  genuinely reflects the distinctive Scottish book market, with a Scottish range  and marketing manager and two Scottish operating managers; contrasts this with  the highly centralised structure and purchasing policy of HMV/Waterstones,  which has led to a decrease in in-store diversity and availability of Scottish  books through Waterstones; thus recognises that this takeover is potentially  very damaging for the Scottish publishing industry, the Scottish printing  industry and Scottish writers and will have the effect of limiting choice for  the Scottish book-buying public and harming our national culture and identity,  and considers that the Competition Commission should investigate this takeover  on the grounds of market dominance in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3319 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Renewable Energy Opportunities&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament supports the view that Scotland should initiate more fuel projects  based on oil-producing crops, thus helping to increase the energy supplied from  sustainable sources as required by international obligations, particularly Kyoto;  further welcomes the recent announcement by the Scottish Executive that farmers  who wish to grow energy crops can now apply for grants of up to &pound;1,000 per  hectare; notes that Scotland&rsquo;s only bio-fuel project, Argent, is a welcome  start as it only recycles existing waste vegetable oils; notes that a new  market for relevant crops would be a valuable new opportunity for Scottish  farmers, and recognises that there are literally thousands of acres of  uncropped land lying in set-aside which, if turned into production, could help to  meet Scotland&rsquo;s sustainable energy targets.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3315 Mr Mark Ruskell: Action on Climate Change&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the publication  of satellite data showing that the extent of Arctic sea ice is at an all-time  minimum and considers that this shortage of sea ice may be part of a positive  feedback loop that will lead to further global warming; further notes the  findings of a recent article, published in the journal, <em>Science</em>, that category 4 and 5 hurricanes have become more frequent  over the past 35 years, coinciding with an increase in sea surface  temperatures; considers, in the light of these findings, that global climate  change is now the most serious and most urgent political issue facing us, and  calls on all political parties to engage in a mature debate in an attempt to  achieve consensus on ways to minimise Scotland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3300 Mary Scanlon: City of Inverness Recognised in RBS &pound;50 Banknote&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament  notes the historic decision by the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), one of the  world&rsquo;s largest banks, to issue its first &pound;50 banknote in almost 300 years;  welcomes its recognition of the growing significance of the Highland capital  through its portrait of Inverness Castle on this banknote, and believes that  this image is a symbolic and worthy gesture in respect of Inverness&rsquo;s award of  Scottish city status in 2000 and its ongoing expansion.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3299# Helen Eadie: Coalfields Communities in Fife&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament commends the  work of the Coalfields Communities Campaign and, in particular, its  publication, <em>Deprivation in Scottish  Coalfields Communities</em>, which is based on an analysis of the Scottish  Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2004; further notes that coalfields communities  continue to struggle some twenty years since the pits closed, the extent of  which deprivation has not always been noticed because of the concentration of  deprivation in Glasgow; recognises that Fife includes the former coalfield with  the largest population in Scotland and that this coalfield remains  disproportionately deprived in relation to the Scottish national average with  some of the most deprived data zones in Scotland being in Fife, the poorest of  which areas are contained in the wards of Ballingry, Lochore, Methil, Smeaton  and Overton and that, across the central Fife coalfield area, one in three  people are on state benefit or unemployed or are in the lowest grade of  workers; finally notes that health indicators are particularly concerning with  Lochore, for example, where the rate of people unable to work due to illness of  disability is 89% above the Scottish average and the rate of claimants with  disability living allowance is 103% above the Scottish average, and hopes that the  Scottish Executive will urgently consider establishing a taskforce to develop a  matrix of targeted support from all agencies involving the public and private  sector.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3162# Mr David Davidson: Role of Firefighters in Remote and Rural  Areas&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament applauds the excellent work and invaluable  role carried out by those firefighters in remote and rural parts of north east Scotland  on the retained duty system but acknowledges the chronic shortage of such  firefighters in some Scottish towns; notes that figures published by Her  Majesty&rsquo;s Chief Inspector of Fire Services in Scotland in 2003-04 show levels  of retained staff in Scotland running at some 30% below the authorised  establishment; considers that these staffing shortages place considerable  strain on existing retained staff to support their local communities, and  believes that the Scottish Executive should consider innovative ways in which  businesses could support recruitment into the retained sector and undertake to  examine new mechanisms to encourage businesses and the self-employed to  understand the benefits of releasing staff to perform the role of retained  firefighters in their communities.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-2911# John Home Robertson: Affordable Rented Housing&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament is concerned about the shortage of affordable rented housing in East  Lothian and many communities and the fact that some applicants in overcrowded  or unsuitable accommodation can be stuck on waiting lists for years, while  others may be compelled to buy or rent housing that they cannot afford;  suggests that there is a need for a clearer definition of affordability for the  purposes of housing policy; welcomes initiatives by the Scottish Executive to  help councils and registered social landlords to increase the supply of  affordable housing, including prudential borrowing to fund new building;  recognises that the high cost of development land is hindering that policy, and  believes that there is a case for further measures to help local authorities to  acquire and secure land for affordable housing in the Executive&rsquo;s proposed  Planning Bill.</p>
