<STRONG>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Batasuna Ban</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament regrets 
the decision of the Spanish Government to disenfranchise the voters, members and 
supporters of the Basque nationalist party Batasuna by the imposition of an undemocratic 
ban on its legitimate activities in furthering the cause of Basque independence.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3328</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Adam: The Death of Kathleen Cory</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes with sadness the recent death of the family tree pioneer, Kathleen Cory,

in Scotland, namely her ground-breaking book, <em>Tracing Your Scottish Ancestry</em>.</P><P>Supported 
by: Mr Adam Ingram<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3327#</STRONG> <STRONG>Karen 
Gillon: Attacks on Emergency Service Staff</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament condemns 
the mindless attacks against emergency services workers; recognises the vital 
role that fire-fighters, ambulance staff and police officers provide in supporting 
the local community and ensuring public safety, and considers that the Scottish 
Executive should take all necessary steps to ensure that the safety of all staff 
who work within the emergency services is safeguarded.</P><P>Supported by: Mr 
Michael McMahon, Shona Robison, Robin Harper, Kate Maclean, Johann Lamont, Stewart 
Stevenson, Mr Tom McCabe, Dr Sylvia Jackson, Brian Fitzpatrick, Elaine Smith, 
Janis Hughes, Rhoda Grant, Mr Keith Raffan, Fiona Hyslop, Alex Johnstone, Lord

Welsh<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3326</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Lloyd Quinan: 
MMR and TaqMan PCR Blood Test</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the 
recent findings of Professor John O&#146;Leary following his use of the DNA blood 
test, Taqman PCR, which has provided further evidence of a link between the MMR 
vaccine and autism; believes that the Scottish Executive should provide funding 
to enable all autistic children to have this test on the NHS, and supports the 
family of Angus Kyle, who paid for this test privately, in its legal case against 
the manufacturers of the MMR vaccine.</P><P>Supported by: Adam Ingram*</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3325#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mary Scanlon: Ferry Services to the Northern Isles</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with concern the on-going situation surrounding the transfer 
of the contract for ferry links to the northern isles; recognises that these services 
provide a crucial lifeline for island communities and businesses, particularly 
the agriculture and fishing industries, through a substantial volume of passenger 
and freight transport, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure 
that ferry links between the mainland, Orkney and Shetland are maintained into 
the future.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3324</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: The Threat 
To Haggis, Scotland's National Dish</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
concern that the Food Standards Agency has made a formal request to the European 
Commission to ban the use of sheep&#146;s intestines across the European Union 
without any acknowledgement of its unique role in Scotland&#146;s national dish, 
the haggis; further notes the lack of any scientific link between the possible 
existence of BSE in sheep and its transference to humans through sheep&#146;s 
intestine; believes that using the same weak criteria could see future bans extended 
to the offal content of haggis and that such unsubstantiated health scares only 
serve to undermine the genuine need for effective public health campaigns; recognises 
the crucial importance of haggis to Scotland&#146;s national culture, its popularity 
at home and abroad and the enjoyment it brings to so many people, and further 
believes that, given the absence of any hard evidence and the exceedingly low 
theoretical risk to public health, Scots should be free to choose how they like 
their haggis cooked and served. </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3323</STRONG> <STRONG>Nicola 
Sturgeon: Glasgow Acute Services Review</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
the outcome of the acute services review in Glasgow; welcomes the proposed £700 
million investment in hospital services; expresses concern about aspects of the 
review, including the proposed number and location of in-patient hospitals and 
the planned reduction of accident and emergency departments from five to two, 
and calls on the Scottish Executive to reconsider its approval of Greater Glasgow 
NHS Board&#146;s proposals.</P><P>Supported by: Ms Sandra White, Linda Fabiani</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3322 
Karen Gillon on behalf of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee: Commissioner 
for Children and Young People Bill</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament agrees to 
the proposal for a Committee Bill under Rule 9.15 contained in the 11th Report 
2002 of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, <em>Report on Proposed Commissioner 
for Children and Young People Bill</em> (SP Paper 617). </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3319.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Adam: Aberdeen City Council Planning Application for a Football 
Stadium and Other Facilities at Kingswells</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
(S1M-3319) in the name of Mr Mike Rumbles, leave out from "Aberdeen" to end and 
insert "that only two of the twelve Liberal Democrat councillors on Aberdeen City 
Council supported a proposal to the Scottish Executive for a public inquiry into 
a planning application for a new football stadium and other facilities at Kingswells; 
further notes with concern the conduct of one of Mr Mike Rumbles MSP's employees, 
who is a member of the council; agrees that the recent allegations of wrongdoing 
within the council have undermined the public&#146;s confidence in the openness 
and transparency of the planning process, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
to hold a public inquiry on the application as a matter of urgency."</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3318.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Scotland vs Israel Under 21s Football Match</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3318) in the name of Pauline McNeill, leave out from 
&quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the importance that 
sport plays in building relationships between different cultures and nations all 
over the world and therefore supports the decision of the Scottish Football Association 
to arrange a friendly fixture between the Scottish and Israeli under-21 football 
teams; recalls that Scottish teams have in the past played the Soviet Union, Iran, 
Saudi Arabia, Israel, Argentina, East Germany and Egypt and many other teams where 
grounds for political objections existed without so much as a whimper; suggests 
that politicising Scottish sporting events could leave a Scottish-based Euro 2008 
tournament open to political blackmail by other nations just as the 1986 Commonwealth 
Games was; celebrates the right to peaceful protest outside a sporting fixture 
as an integral part of any democracy but unreservedly condemns as undemocratic 
and counterproductive any attempts to stop a sporting event by physical or violent 
means, and believes that ultimately participation is a matter for the individual 
conscience of any sportsmen and women involved.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3316# 
MMR and Autism Research</STRONG> (lodged on 21 August 2002) Elaine Smith<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Ms Margo MacDonald<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3309#</STRONG> <STRONG>Mrs 
Margaret Ewing: NHS Dental Services in Moray</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
<A NAME="MotionText">recognises that the provision of NHS dental services in Moray 
has reached crisis point; finds it unacceptable that residents of Moray now have 
to travel to Aberdeen to register with an NHS dentist, and believes that the Scottish 
Executive and Grampian NHS Board should increase their efforts to recruit and 
retain dentists to the area.</A></P><P>Supported by: Brian Adam, Stewart Stevenson,

on Title to Sue for Non-Patrimonial Loss </STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
(S1M-3302) in the name of Robin Harper, leave out from &quot;as a matter of urgency&quot;

Scottish Place Names Survey</STRONG> (lodged on 21 June 2002) Ms Margo MacDonald<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>S1M-3114.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Pauline McNeill: Glasgow Trongate Regeneration</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3114) in the name of Ms Sandra White, <A NAME="AmendmentText">leave 
out from &quot;pledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes with concern that the 
Trongate area of Glasgow has suffered from neglect and decline in recent years 
whilst other parts of the city have benefited from regeneration and appreciates 
the concerns of local traders in that regard; is pleased to note that Glasgow 
City Council has approved a five year regeneration plan for the area and has made 
budget provision for a range of immediate projects including public realm improvements, 
shop front improvements, shop front replacement, new street lighting and signage 
and a major area marketing programme, and considers that Glasgow MSPs should express 
their full support for the council initiative and for the development of further 
co-operative projects involving the community, businesses and local authority.&quot;</A></P><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
