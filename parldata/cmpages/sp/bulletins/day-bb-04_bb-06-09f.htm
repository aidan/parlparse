          <p><strong>*S2M-1442</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Big 
            Fit Walk</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Grangemouth Health 
            Promotion Group and Integrated Learning Community on its organisation 
            of the Big Fit Walk on 11 June 2004; notes that the object is to raise 
            awareness of the health benefits of physical activity by encouraging 
            as many people as possible to take a 30-minute walk and that at least 
            3,000 people in Grangemouth are expected to do so on 11 June; further 
            notes that this event builds upon other innovative local initiatives 
            such as the GP Exercise Referral Scheme, and hopes that in future 
            years there will be Scotland-wide Big Fit Walks.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1441#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Urgent 
            Action for the Dove Centre, Edinburgh</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the excellent work of the Dove Centre in Edinburgh in providing 
            a community transport service in West Edinburgh, providing a service 
            forum for older people, promoting the West Edinburgh Canal Society 
            and helping to achieve a City for All Ages; further notes the decision 
            of the Edinburgh Capital City Partnership to award the Dove Centre 
            £32,000 social inclusion funding; further notes the Community Planning 
            Partnership's recommendation that the funding arrangements for the 
            Dove Centre be reconsidered in light of the centre's promotion of 
            social inclusion for older people and especially community transport 
            focused on older people; believes that this reconsideration is a matter 
            of urgency given the imminent departure of the co-ordinator and the 
            end of transport provision for vulnerable older people due to lack 
            of funds, and considers that all concerned agencies should help guarantee 
            the future of this project.</P>

            to it continuing to welcome royalty, movie legends and sporting greats 
            from throughout the world to Perthshire so that they can appreciate 
            the local hospitality and Perthshire's natural beauty and heritage.</P>

            the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Suspension of Standing 
            Orders</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that Rule 5.6.1(c) of the 
            Standing Orders be suspended for the duration of the Meeting of the

            Euro 2004 Success</strong>-That the Parliament wishes England every 
            success in the European Championships 2004 in Portugal; hopes that 
            the England fans follow the example of Scotland's Tartan Army in being 
            the friendliest fans in world football, and wishes Portugal a highly 
            successful tournament.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1436</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>UCI 
            Mountain Bike World Cup</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the organisers and supporters of the Fort William round of the 2004 
            UCI Mountain Bike World Cup; further congratulates the BBC on providing 
            televised coverage of the event; welcomes the growing popularity of 
            mountain biking with visitors to Scotland and the bid to bring the 
            World Championships here in 2007, and notes the promotional role of 
            cycle sport as part of a wider cycle culture in Scotland that can 
            help to deliver goals of public health improvement and sustainable 
            transport.</P>

            notes with concern the failure of the board of management of the Central

            National President of the Further Education Lecturers' Association 
            of the Educational Institute of Scotland, within the requisite timescale 
            laid down by the employment tribunal, which found he had been unfairly 
            dismissed because of his trade union activities, and considers that 
            he should be reinstated immediately.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1434</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Trans-bus 
            Consortium Buy-Out</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 
            consortium of Scottish business leaders for safeguarding 900 jobs 
            in Camelon and Larbert by rescuing the Falkirk bus building firm, 
            Alexander Dennis, from receivership and for securing a new contract 
            worth £7.5 million to deliver 50 new double-decker buses and wishes 
            the firm well in all its future negotiations, whilst noting that the 
            rejuvenation of this firm is especially welcome against the background 
            of a Scottish manufacturing slump.</P>

            Boys Football Club on their recent triumph in winning the Summer Cup 
            Final at Glasgow Green; recognises the achievements of the club over 
            the last three years in gaining promotion twice; hopes that the players

            and thanks the manager, Brian Graham, and all of the other volunteers

            in Dumfriesshire, particularly in peace education in schools; recognises 
            the valuable contribution that principles of non-violence and co-operation 
            can make to society and supports the development of skills in conflict 
            resolution, and believes that the Scottish Executive should therefore 
            consider a cross-sectoral review of various peace initiatives, not 
            just in education, but in justice, health and other areas, liaising 
            with COSLA, NHS boards, religious groups, voluntary organisations 
            and other relevant bodies in order to bring forward an integrated

            that 16 teams of the world's elite cyclists are taking part; further 
            notes that this event has the support of the BBC with all the coverage 
            that this entails both within the United Kingdom and throughout the 
            world; sees great advantages for tourism for all areas included in 
            this road race and notes that Richard Caborn, UK Minister of State 
            for Sport and Tourism, said that this event can promote tourism in 
            &quot;the whole country&quot;; notes however that this &quot;Tour

            East Midlands and South Wales, finishing on the streets of Westminster, 
            but does not include Scotland, and urges British Cycling to apologise 
            for the omission of Scotland from this event and to ensure that as 
            long as Scotland is still a member of the United Kingdom it is fully

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1425</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Oil 
            War and Climate Change</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the conference, 
            &quot;Oil, War and Climate Change&quot;, which took place in Edinburgh 
            on Saturday 29 May 2004; acknowledges that Tony Blair has said that 
            climate change is the most important environmental issue facing the 
            world today and that Her Majesty's Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, 
            Sir David King, describes climate change as a bigger threat than global 
            terrorism; believes that the crisis in Iraq is symptomatic of a greater 
            battle for control of scarce resources, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to step up its measures to tackle climate change by using 
            its influence to promote environmental justice, expressing the will 
            of the Scottish people on reserved issues including defence and energy, 
            setting binding emissions reduction targets for Scotland and taking 
            action to reduce Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions by cutting airport 
            expansion and road building, investing in public transport, supporting 
            environmentally-sustainable renewable energy developments and working 
            towards energy efficient housing in Scotland.</P>
