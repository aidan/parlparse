<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong><br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;<br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong><br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">current motions</a> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Any questions in relation to this section should be directed to the Chamber Desk, for which contact details are provided at the end of the Bulletin.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00056 Kevin Stewart: Promoting Renewables</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of Aberdeen&rsquo;s All-Energy 2011 exhibition and conference, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s largest renewables show, for their efforts; considers that growth in the renewables sector is vital to ensure the reindustrialisation of Scotland, and calls on the UK Government to release Scotland&rsquo;s &pound;195 million Fossil Fuel Levy monies now so that the Scottish Government can invest these resources to boost the Scottish economy and help achieve Scotland&rsquo;s green energy potential.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00055 James Dornan: Give a Kid a Goal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the charity, Glasgow the Caring City, based in the Glasgow Cathcart constituency, for what it considers to be its excellent work in tackling sectarianism, bigotry, racism, youth crime and alcohol misuse across Glasgow through its Give a Kid a Goal project; believes that its approach to these issues, with young people themselves taking the lead in introducing positive changes to their communities, should be encouraged across Scotland, and calls on Glasgow City Council to fully recognise and support what it sees as the good work done by the Reverend Neil Galbraith and the rest of the Give a Kid a Goal team.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00054 Alison Johnstone: Active Travel to School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the results of a Sustrans survey that shows that the number of primary school pupils being driven to school in Edinburgh has fallen from 28.4% to 21.8% in just one year; believes that this is a move in the right direction for the capital but notes with concern that the number of children nationally who walk to school is in decline; considers that walking buses and cycle training for pupils encourage pupils and families to see walking and cycling as safe and attractive ways of getting around; notes that in the last parliamentary session the Scottish Government set a target of 10% modal share for cycling and that the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee recommended unanimously that &quot;an ambitious increase in resources with robust mechanisms&quot; and &quot;stronger more effective and sustained leadership is required from the Scottish Government in order to implement improvements to walking and cycling policies in Scotland&quot;, and urges the Scottish Government to act on this committee report in this parliamentary session.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00053 Jamie Hepburn: Cumbernauld and Kilsyth&rsquo;s Rugby Stars</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its congratulations to St Joseph&rsquo;s, Chapelgreen, St Patrick&rsquo;s, Ravenswood, Carbrain and Cumbernauld primaries on successfully qualifying for the North Lanarkshire area primary six and seven rugby finals, which are to take place in Coatbridge on 3 June 2011; applauds all those who have taken part in the tournament so far for their hard work, and wishes the best of luck to those competing in the finals.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00052 Helen Eadie: Cardenden Pupils Support Human Rights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Ninian&rsquo;s Roman Catholic Primary School in Cardenden for being a UNICEF Rights Respecting School by putting the rights of the child at the heart of its planning, policies, practices and ethos; particularly welcomes the work that the children are currently undertaking in recognising the impact of climate change on Guyana, and strongly supports the children&rsquo;s aims to raise awareness of the floods in Guyana that were caused by climate change and that deny children the basic rights to clean water, food, shelter, health and education.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00051 Tavish Scott: Olympic Torch to Reach Shetland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the 2012 Olympic Torch is to visit Shetland on its 8,000-mile relay of the United Kingdom next summer as part of its journey from Land&rsquo;s End to the Olympic stadium; welcomes the inclusion of the UK&rsquo;s most northerly community, which, it considers, is all too often overlooked by Scottish and UK bodies to the extent that sometimes it does not even appear on their maps, and hopes that many Shetland athletes, such as the young Shetland fencer and all-round sportswoman, Mhairi Gifford, from the Brae High School, who represented both Shetland and Scotland when the relay route was announced at Land&rsquo;s End on the 18 May 2011, will get the opportunity to act as torchbearers.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00050 Sarah Boyack: Plastic Bag Campaign Carries Council Support</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the City of Edinburgh Council to investigate how a reusable bag scheme could be rolled out across the city; notes the efforts of the Ban Plastic Bags Edinburgh campaign to highlight this issue and also the work of local campaign group Greener Leith, which currently operates such a scheme to encourage people to use local shops; believes that reusable bag schemes can make a contribution to helping Scotland move toward a zero-waste society, and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate how reusable bag schemes can be supported and rolled out across Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Elaine Smith*, Kenneth Gibson*, Patrick Harvie*, John Park*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00048 Alex Fergusson: South of Scotland Omission from Olympic Torch Schedule</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its disappointment that the Olympic Torch will not visit the South of Scotland on its tour of the United Kingdom; believes that it should visit the region after leaving Northern Ireland, given that the ferry route to Loch Ryan provides the gateway to Scotland from the province, and calls on Lord Coe as Chairman of the Organising Committee to revisit the route to ensure that the South of Scotland is included in the Olympic Torch relay.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Scott*, Elaine Murray*, John Lamont*, Hugh Henry*, Margaret Mitchell*, Jim Hume*, Aileen McLeod*, Paul Wheelhouse*, Jamie McGrigor*, Mary Scanlon*, Murdo Fraser*, Liz Smith*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00047 Margaret Mitchell: Forum of Private Business&rsquo;s Business Buddy Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that, as part of the Forum of Private Business&rsquo;s Get Britain Trading campaign, a business buddy scheme has been initiated that aims to buddy elected representatives with small businesses in their constituency so that members can get a clear indication of how these businesses operate, what challenges they currently face and how they can best represent them; notes that the scheme aims to make life simpler for small businesses in order to help them and the economy grow; congratulates the Forum of Private Business on the initiative; considers that such a scheme will help to foster good relationships between MSPs and small businesses across Scotland, and hopes that many MSPs will take this opportunity to engage with small businesses in their communities.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Lamont*, Kenneth Gibson*, Jim Hume*, Jamie McGrigor*, Jackson Carlaw*, Bob Doris*, Murdo Fraser*, Liz Smith*, Nanette Milne*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00046 John Pentland: Good Luck Motherwell Football Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes the very best of luck to Motherwell Football Club in the final of the Scottish Cup at Hampden; recognises that this is Motherwell&rsquo;s first Scottish Cup final appearance for 20 years; notes that the occasion falls on the club&rsquo;s 125th birthday; congratulates all those involved at the club, from the players and coaching staff to fans and board members, for their efforts, and wishes them the best of luck, and looks forward to a great final at Hampden Park.</p>
<p>Supported by: Patricia Ferguson*, Richard Lyle*, Margaret Mitchell*, Clare Adamson*, Neil Findlay*, Mike MacKenzie*, John Park*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00045 Bill Kidd: Trident Initial Gate Just the Start</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the UK Government announcement that it plans, over the next five years, to spend several billion pounds on new nuclear-armed submarines and that each of these will be powered by its own onboard PWR3 nuclear reactor, which will further increase the cost of the Trident replacement programme, and expresses concern that the UK Government&rsquo;s plan is for these new submarines to be based at Faslane until the year 2060, which it considers flies in the face of the 2007 vote of the Scottish Parliament and of consistent polling of the Scottish population to strongly oppose this programme on moral and financial grounds.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00020 Mark McDonald: Court of Session Ruling on Tobacco Vending Machine Ban</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the efforts of successive MSPs and Scottish administrations to reduce the number of people smoking in Scotland; considers that cigarettes are an addictive and harmful product and should not be made available via vending machines; welcomes the ruling by the Court of Session that banning tobacco vending machines is not outwith the Parliament&rsquo;s legislative competence, and looks forward to the ban coming into force.</p>
