              Sub-Post Offices - "Your Guide"</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
              acknowledges the importance of the role that sub-post offices play 
              in Scottish communities, particularly in rural areas and deprived 
              urban areas; recognises the potential financial consequences for 
              sub-post offices in Scotland of the UK-wide Automated Credit Transfer 
              system for the payment of benefits; notes that &quot;Your Guide&quot; 
              is a comprehensive information service currently being evaluated 
              for sub-post offices in England and Wales; further notes that such 
              a service includes Government General Practitioner and Internet 
              Learning Access Point initiatives, both of which provide members 
              of the public with the ability to interact with departments of Her 
              Majesty&#146;s Government and gain government information in an 
              accessible way; further recognises the potential benefits that such 
              a service could provide in Scotland, in terms of improving openness 
              and public participation with government, as well as potentially 
              providing a timely boost to business levels for sub-post offices 
              at a time when the network is having difficulty in sustaining such 
              levels, and considers that the Scottish Executive should pilot such 
              a scheme in Scotland, with a view to rolling out the service across 
              the country as soon as possible. </p>
