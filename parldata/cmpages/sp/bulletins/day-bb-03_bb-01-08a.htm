          <p><strong>S1M-2874</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon:</strong> <strong>Drugs 
            and Driving</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">expresses 
            concern about the number of lives lost in road traffic crashes that 
            may have been caused by people driving whilst under the influence 
            of legal and illegal drugs; recognises that, in law, driving while 
            unfit through drugs is an offence; notes that Transport Research Laboratory 
            tests demonstrated a significant increase between the 1980s and 1990s 
            in the percentage of people testing positive for illegal drugs who 
            have been involved in fatal collisions; welcomes the launch by the 
            British Medical Association of its web resource on research that has 
            been undertaken and is currently in progress; considers that there 
            should be speedier and more specific and co-ordinated research in 
            order that appropriate and conclusive drug testing devices can be 
            introduced, and believes that there should be a Scottish campaign 
            in order to educate the public that the side effects of illegal and 
            certain prescribed drugs can affect their ability to drive. </a></p>
