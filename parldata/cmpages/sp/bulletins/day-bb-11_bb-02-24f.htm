<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8002 Cathy Peattie: Sign-VRS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the development by the social enterprise company, Sign-VRS, of a new video relay service that enables Deaf people to call anyone using the service&rsquo;s BSL interpreters to translate the call; notes that Sign-VRS is the first dedicated video relay service in Scotland; further notes that Sign-VRS uses Sign-now.com technology, which is, uniquely in the United Kingdom, owned and managed by Deaf people, and, considers that the Scottish Government should support the wider use of this technology.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8001 Patrick Harvie: Ending The SPCB&rsquo;s Contract with Vodafone</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that public contracts should not be awarded to companies that deprive the public sector of vital funds by using substantial tax avoidance schemes; supports the campaign by UK Uncut to highlight tax avoidance and set out alternatives to the cuts agenda; notes reports that Vodafone&rsquo;s recent deal with HM Revenue and Customs reduced its tax liability by almost &pound;6 billion, and urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to terminate the Parliament&rsquo;s contract with Vodafone until the company can demonstrate that it pays the equivalent of the full rate of corporation tax on its profits.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-8000 Pauline McNeill: Concern over Cuts at the University of Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave concern over the cuts that the University of Glasgow has proposed in a number of departments, including Scotland&rsquo;s only school of Slavonic studies and the key department of Adult and Continuing Education, which, it considers has been critical in widening access to the University of Glasgow; believes that these cuts are being proposed as a consequence of the 8% cut to higher education funding outlined by the Scottish Government; supports the staff, students and trade unions in their campaign against the proposals; notes with concern trade union fears that the consultation process has thus far lacked appropriate inclusion and transparency, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene to ensure that a meaningful consultation process takes place in an attempt to safeguard what it considers the valuable, and in some cases unique, departments that have been singled out for closure.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7999 Pauline McNeill: Kelvingrove, Scotland&rsquo;s Number One</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum on, once again, being named as the nation&rsquo;s most popular free visitor attraction, with 1,070,521 visitors in 2010; notes the record-breaking success of the Glasgow Boys exhibition, which attracted over 120,000 visitors; celebrates the fact that over 140,000 people visited Kelvingrove last July to view Titian&rsquo;s <em>Diana and Actaeon</em> masterpiece during its stay in Glasgow; considers Kelvingrove to be a perfect venue for displaying more of Scotland&rsquo;s artistic treasures and national collections, and encourages the National Galleries of Scotland to participate in similar schemes involving other works in its collection.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7998 Brian Adam: Positive Outlook for Oil and Gas Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the latest activity survey from Oil and Gas UK, which shows that last year the industry supported around 440,000 jobs, paid more than &pound;9.3 billion in production taxes and provided around 60% of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s energy needs; welcomes the reported 60% increase in capital investment in UK exploration and production over the last two years, which has slowed the rate of decline from the UK continental shelf (UKCS), and the potential for an additional 10,000 to 15,000 jobs to be created if investment continues; understands that most of the growth in reserves has been from west of Shetland fields, and calls on the UK Government to improve incentives for further developments in the UKCS to secure future jobs, prosperity and energy security.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7997 Dave Thompson: From Fishing to Fashion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish knitters who make up the Moray Firth Gansey Project on having their designs modelled at London Fashion Week; notes that the project was set up to preserve the heritage of the Moray Firth&rsquo;s fishing communities; further notes that the gansey, a distinctive, seamless, woollen pullover, traditionally worn by seamen and fishermen, was featured in design house Meadham Kirchhoff&rsquo;s London Fashion Week show and congratulates the quines and loons of the Moray Firth for providing the attire worn; acknowledges that the project is funded by the Scottish Government, LEADER, the National Lottery and the European Agriculture and Development Fund, and wishes the project the best of success in continuing the tribute to the Moray Firth fishing communities and in preserving traditional Scottish heritage, crafts and culture.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7996 Ian McKee: Scotland Needs Minimum Pricing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the findings of NHS Scotland&rsquo;s alcohol statistics 2011 report showing that Scots drink far higher quantities of alcohol than their counterparts in the rest of the United Kingdom; observes that the report, published every two years to give an account of Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol, relates to data from 2009 and reveals that in that year Scots drank the equivalent of 11.9 litres of alcohol per person over the age of 16 compared with 9.6 litres per person in England and Wales; further notes that alcohol consumption has doubled in Scotland over the past 20 years resulting in more than 100 alcohol-related hospital admissions each day; expresses further concern at the increase in alcohol-related deaths in women and in the 8% increase in the number of alcohol-related discharges from psychiatric hospitals; highlights that 54% of men and women drink the most alcohol at home and that off-license sales have increased year on year; considers that Scotland&rsquo;s drink culture will not change unless concrete action is taken to increase the price of alcohol, and believes that, if the SNP government&rsquo;s proposals for minimum unit pricing had been passed, fewer people would be suffering the consequences of cheap alcohol and progress to save lives and reduce alcohol-related hospital admissions would already be underway.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7994 Andrew Welsh on behalf of the Finance Committee: Report on Preventative Spending</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Finance Committee&rsquo;s 1st Report, 2011 (Session 3): <em>Report on preventative spending</em> (SP Paper 555).</p>
<p>Supported by: Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7993 Pauline McNeill: Support for the Libyan People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the citizens of Libya in what it considers their brave fight for freedom; calls on the Scottish and UK governments to condemn unequivocally Muammar Gaddafi for the reported brutal murder of hundreds of unarmed protesters in Libya; recognises and applauds those sections of the Libyan armed forces who, in an echo of what it sees as the noble and uplifting scenes in neighbouring Egypt, have defected from the Libyan regime to join the protesters, and further calls on the international community to support the Libyan people in their struggle for democracy and peace.</p>
