                          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following 
                            amendments</p>
                          <p><strong>S1M-3048.1</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:

                            an amendment to motion (S1M-3048) in the name of Cathy 
                            Jamieson, leave out from &quot;and welcomes&quot; 
                            and insert &quot;encourages all of Scotland&#146;s 
                            young people to have open and enquiring minds about 
                            the future of their country, their continent and their 
                            world, in order that they might take an active part 
                            in the widest range of national and international 
                            affairs, and therefore requests that the Executive 
                            consult widely with Scotland&#146;s young people as 
                            well as with other devolved administrations and other 
                            European governments in order that there can be a 
                            positive and informed Scottish response to the European 
                            Union white paper on youth.&quot; </p>

                            Helping Scotland's Youth Participate in Communities</strong>&#151;As 
                            an amendment to motion (S1M-3048) in the name of Cathy 
                            Jamieson, leave out from "agrees" to "Youth Parliament" 
                            and insert "pays tribute to the important role of 
                            voluntary organisations in developing the awareness 
                            of, and involving, young people in civic society; 
                            emphasises the crucial role of Scotland's schools; 
                            agrees to support constructive work with young people 
                            as they engage in civic society and democratic processes 
                            whether at local level through local authority youth 
                            councils, or at national level through organisations 
                            such as the Scottish Youth Parliament; believes that, 
                            given the alarming decrease in young people voting 
                            in elections in recent years, schools and voluntary 
                            groups should take a lead in encouraging young people 
                            to re-engage in the mainstream political process".</p>

                        <strong>Ageism</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
                        research findings by Help the Aged indicating that over 
                        50% of Scots in the 65-74 age group feel that the country 
                        treated older people as if they were &quot;on the scrap 
                        heap&quot; and &quot;a burden to society&quot;; believes 
                        that such treatment is unacceptable and perpetuates ageism 
                        in society, which can be seen in both deliberate and inadvertent 
                        discrimination in the attitudes of both public and private 
                        sector organisations, allied to continued media stereotyping 
                        of older people, and therefore considers that the Scottish 
                        Executive should identify and address areas of age discrimination 
                        in Scottish public life so that older people feel valued 
                        and can make a full and positive contribution to society.
