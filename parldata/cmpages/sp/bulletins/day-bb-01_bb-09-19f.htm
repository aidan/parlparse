          <p><strong>*S1M-2236</strong> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: Effective Assessment in Scotland's 
            Schools</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance of effective 
            assessment in schools as a means of improving learning and achievement 
            and supports the Executive's plans to create a coherent system of 
            assessment for Scotland; further recognises that the best way to achieve 
            this is by (a) ensuring that the monitoring and reporting of pupils' 
            progress is done in a consistent way throughout the school years; 
            (b) supporting teachers to make sound judgements about pupils' learning 
            and parents to be involved with their children's development; (c) 
            improving national monitoring of achievement in key areas, and (d) 
            bringing together diverse approaches to record-keeping and reporting 
            in a single, integrated framework, and supports the Executive's plans 
            to involve stakeholders in carrying forward these proposals and to 
            introduce a simpler, more streamlined approach which is effective 
            and easier for teachers, parents and pupils to understand.</p>

            in relation to wild mammals into line with that which applies to domestic

            all forms of mounted foxhunting, together with the use of captured 
            live animals as bait for hunting with dogs, and (c) create a properly
