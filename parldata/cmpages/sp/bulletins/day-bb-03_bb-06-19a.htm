           <DIR> 
          <P>9:30 am&#9;Debate on the Water Industry-</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-162</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Water 
            Industry</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the dramatic 
            increases in charges by Scottish Water to businesses in 2003-04 which, 
            in some cases, amount to nearly 500% more than the amount charged 
            in 2002-03; believes that these increased charges bear no relation 
            to the service provided by Scottish Water to these customers; is concerned 
            that these rising cost have increased the competitive disadvantage 
            faced by Scottish firms, particularly in relation to England; further 
            notes that household bills have gone up by 94% in real terms over 
            the past decade, while English domestic bills have only risen by 22% 
            since 1989; acknowledges that privatisation in England has brought 
            substantial capital investment which has led to lower bills for businesses 
            and households alongside improved water quality; calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to address urgently the concerns of domestic and business 
            customers in relation to these higher charges and to look at widening 
            competition with a view to reducing costs, and further believes that, 
            as public ownership has failed customers in Scotland, the Executive 
            should investigate models of private ownership</P>
          <DIR> <DIR> 
          <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-162.3</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson: Water Industry</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-162) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave 
            out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes 
            that, having established Scottish Water in 2002, this is the right 
            means of delivering cost-effective and improved services in accordance 
            with the requirements of the Parliament and that in the short time 
            since Scottish Water's establishment, it has started the process of 
            delivering cost effective and improved services, and further believes 
            that a review of its ownership and funding now would undermine that 
            progress to the detriment of all customers."</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-162.4</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Water Industry</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-162) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave 
            out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "believes that the offices 
            of the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland and the Water Quality 
            Regulator should be amalgamated to create a tough new champion on 
            behalf of customers; further believes that a full and detailed review 
            of the financial control arrangements for Scottish Water requires 
            to be undertaken as a matter of urgency with a view to affording Scottish 
            Water greater financial flexibility, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to consider a not-for-profit trust to provide an appropriate vehicle 
            for investment which would allow Scottish Water to be free of artificial 
            constraints and keep charges under control."</P>

          <P><em>followed by&#9;</em>Debate on Care Homes for the Elderly-</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-161</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Care 
            Homes for the Elderly</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the threat of closure to the majority of the Church of Scotland's 
            care homes; further notes that this crisis has occurred against a 
            background of the Scottish Executive's assurance in the last session 
            of the Parliament that funding issues had been resolved; believes, 
            therefore, that this matter needs to be re-examined as a matter of 
            urgency with a view to achieving a sustainable funding agreement and 
            ending inequality in funding between local authority-run homes and 
            independent homes; recognises that there is a longer term issue to 
            be addressed by government, and calls on the Executive to consult 
            with Her Majesty's Government on how people might be encouraged to 
            make greater provision for their own long-term care</P>
          <DIR> <DIR> 
          <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-161.4</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe: Care Homes for 
            the Elderly</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-161) in the name

            &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the problems 
            faced by some Church of Scotland care homes but recognises that the 
            Scottish Executive has met in full the recommendations of the National 
            Review Group on care home fees which resulted in an extra investment 
            of over £130 million in the care home sector since July 2001; welcomes 
            the work currently being undertaken by COSLA and the care home sector 
            in establishing a framework for assessing the cost of providing care 
            for older people from 2005-06, and notes the continuing commitment 
            of the Executive to shift the balance of care from institutional settings 
            to providing care at home and its setting up of the national care 
            standards which provide a quality framework.&quot; </A></P>
          <P><strong>S2M-161.1</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Care Homes 
            for the Elderly</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-161) in the 
            name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from "believes" to end and insert 
            "regrets that the present funding levels to the voluntary and private 
            sectors leave vulnerable older people exposed to disruption and distress 
            at a point in their lives when they deserve support and stability; 
            believes that the Executive should undertake an urgent review of funding 
            for the care home sector based on an analysis of the true cost of 
            care, and calls on the Executive to carry out an urgent review of 
            bed provision in care homes in order to establish and commit to a 
            long-term plan for the sector.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-161.3</strong> <strong>John Swinburne: Care Homes for

            insert &quot;means testing discriminates against residents who have 
            made provision for their long-term care and calls on the Executive 
            to provide long-term care for the elderly without such discrimination&quot;.</P>
