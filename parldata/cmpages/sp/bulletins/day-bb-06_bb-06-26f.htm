<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>(<a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm</a>).  A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at: </strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4608</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Montrose Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils of Montrose Academy on their success in winning the National Youth Parliament Competition for the second year running; notes that a Montrose Academy pupil was also voted best non-executive spokesperson; commends all the teams on their hard work and preparation, and hopes that the contestants will continue to take an active role in society and encourage their peers to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4607&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Hidden Price of Treatment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of Macmillan Cancer Support that, while the average cancer patient in the United Kingdom pays &pound;325 in travel and parking costs over the course of treatment, in Scotland this cost rises to &pound;636 as cancer patients travel on average 53 times to hospital for treatment, a situation which is exacerbated in rural areas such as the south of Scotland; further notes that, of the 70% of cancer patients who face extra costs to get treatment, only 22% receive financial help and, of these, only 4% receive help from existing government schemes; notes that this situation is compounded by an average loss of income of 50% as a direct result of cancer, and therefore considers that the Scottish government should review urgently the financial assistance available for travel costs and consider an exemption from hospital car parking charges for all who require repeat courses of treatment for cancer and other life-threatening conditions.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Mr John Swinney<strong>*</strong>, Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4606</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>European Football Championships</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that holding major sporting events, such as the European Football Championships, in Scotland brings enormous benefits, including the opportunity to promote Scotland on the world stage; recognises that these benefits would be accompanied by the opportunity to enhance the Scottish tourist industry and to promote sport and healthy living to the next generation; acknowledges that for such a bid to be successful it must involve the combined effort of the Scottish government, the Scottish football authorities and the public and private sectors all working together to secure the tournament for Scotland, and urges the Scottish government to throw its weight behind a Scotland-only bid for the European Football Championships.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4605&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Return of Bus Services in Scotland to the Public Sector</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the increasing fiasco surrounding the provision of bus services in Glasgow and across Scotland; demands that those companies threatening to withdraw important services in Glasgow face financial penalties and political condemnation; believes that bus services in Glasgow and throughout Scotland, except for the Lothians, will continue to decline while those services are provided on the basis of private companies seeking maximum profit instead of public providers delivering maximum quality and accessible services, and accordingly believes that the Scottish Executive should move quickly to introduce a Bill to return bus services to the public sector so that services can improve and public subsidies are used properly to enhance bus provision instead of disappearing into private bus companies&rsquo; bank accounts.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4604</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Election of Cuba to UN Human Rights Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recently established UN Human Rights Council and the election of Cuba from among United Nations members to sit on the council; recognises that Cuba&rsquo;s election to this human rights body is a ringing endorsement of Cuba&rsquo;s unparalleled record in providing overseas aid and human resources in the fields of health and education to poor and needy nations across the world and its delivery of free health, education and housing to all its citizens, and further notes that the United States of America failed to stand for election to the new human rights body to save the USA from embarrassment in the event of failing to be elected.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4597</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commiserates with the Catalan people that the original Catalan Parliament proposal, passed by 90% of its members, was diluted by the Spanish Parliament which, amongst other things, resulted in Catalonia not being officially and directly recognised as a nation but nevertheless congratulates Catalans on the recent reform that gives them greater autonomy; recognises that the process was initiated by the political parties in the Catalan Parliament and had the agreement of the people of Catalonia expressed through a referendum; further recognises that the new statute formally establishes that the powers of the Generalitat, the institution in which the self-government of Catalonia is politically organised, rest with the people of Catalonia, that Catalonia will have an improved fiscal system with full powers over Catalan and devolved Spanish taxes and that the Spanish State, when dealing with the EU on issues that are devolved to Catalonia, will from this point on allow the Catalan Government&rsquo;s position to be determinant, and believes that Scotland should follow Catalonia&rsquo;s lead by taking control of the devolution process and moving forward to independence.</p>
