          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2182#</strong> <STRONG>George Lyon:</STRONG> <STRONG>Campbeltown Hospital</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that NHS Argyll &amp; Clyde has shut the assessment ward at Campbeltown Hospital with no public consultation and no alternative provision in place; further notes that the board is cutting primary care budgets in Argyll and Bute, despite the fact that the primary care sector in Argyll and Bute has not overspent, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should intervene and press the board to suspend the closure until proper public consultation is carried out and alternative provision supported by the community is put in place and that the board should refocus its cost recovery plan on the areas that have been consistently overspending in the past.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2181</strong> <STRONG>Colin Fox:</STRONG> <STRONG>Forth Rail Bridge</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the bid for World Heritage Site status for the Forth Rail Bridge; recognises the magnificent feat of engineering involved in the construction of the Forth Rail Bridge; acknowledges the dedication, hard work and skill of the working men who built the Forth Rail Bridge; regrets that in the construction of the bridge 57 men lost their lives; calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise these facts within the context of the symbol of Scotland that the bridge represents, and further calls on the Executive to erect a plaque in memory of those workers who lost their lives in the construction.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2180</strong> <STRONG>Patrick Harvie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Congratulations to Mordechai Vanunu</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Mordechai Vanunu on his election as the 119th Rector of the University of Glasgow; believes that Vanunu&rsquo;s election sends an important message to the Palestinian people expressing Scotland&rsquo;s disgust at their treatment at the hands of the Israeli Government; further believes that there is no place in the Middle East, or indeed the world, for weapons of mass destruction, and calls on the British government to exert pressure on Israel to release Mr Vanunu from Israel and allow him to visit the University of Glasgow.</p>

          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2178#</strong> <STRONG>Susan Deacon:</STRONG> <STRONG>Philip Lawrence Awards 2004</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the youth volunteer group at LGBT Youth Scotland for winning one of the eight 2004 community safety Philip Lawrence Awards for their contribution to the community grid and to improving the lives of others; notes that LGBT Youth Scotland was the only Scottish organisation to reach the finals of the community safety awards section; recognises the significant work done by LGBT Youth Scotland in tackling homophobia and bullying; believes that this work continues to make a crucial difference to the lives of young people in Scotland, and commends this work to all who are working to challenge prejudice in Scotland.</p>
