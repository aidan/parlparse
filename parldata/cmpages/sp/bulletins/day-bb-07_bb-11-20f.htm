          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-883</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government&rsquo;s Economic Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of creating a more successful country with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish and notes the publication of <em>The Government Economic Strategy</em>, which sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach to aligning the public, private and voluntary sectors to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S3M-882</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>North Lanarkshire Young People&rsquo;s Panel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the North Lanarkshire Young People&rsquo;s Panel, whose 12 active members have met continually over the past 18 months to assess applications made to the Big Lottery Fund&rsquo;s young people&rsquo;s projects in Scotland and who have helped to gain approximately &pound;736,000 in funding for youngsters across North Lanarkshire over that period; congratulates both the panel members and the Volunteer Centre North Lanarkshire, which organised and supported the panel for the North Lanarkshire area, on its achievement, and believes that such success should encourage the Big Lottery Fund to continue and develop the scheme after the end of January 2008 when it is currently due to end.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-881</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>50th Anniversary of the Kames Colliery Disaster</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 50th anniversary of the disaster at Kames Colliery, Muirkirk, which occurred on Tuesday 19 November 1957 when 17 men were killed and 12 injured; recognises the continuing significance of this event to the people of Muirkirk; commends the local community for the dignity and respect that they have shown to the memory of the victims and their families during the recent events to commemorate the disaster, and pays its respects to the men who lost their lives 50 years ago at Kames Colliery and those who have lost their lives in all Scotland&rsquo;s coal mines.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-880</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Nursery Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the increase in funding entitlement to free nursery education for Scotland&rsquo;s three and four-year-olds from 33 weeks to 38 weeks but is concerned that this funding, under the guidance from the Scottish Government, is available in many local authorities only from the start of the term following the third birthday of the child and leaves many parents in the position of not being able to provide a suitable nursery place for their three-year-old child until the start of the following term, and calls on the Scottish Government to review the guidance provided to local authorities to encourage funding to be available from the child&rsquo;s third birthday and ensure that adequate funding is provided to all local authorities for early years education to be available from the day of a child&rsquo;s third birthday.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-879</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 18th birthday of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which guarantees the rights of all children and young people in Scotland to fulfil their potential; believes that all children and young people in our society, but particularly children with a disability or additional support needs, face a number of barriers in realising these rights, for example to be included, to achieve their promise and to access leisure and recreational activities as well as other core services; supports the work done by the Cross Party Group on Children and Young People to raise awareness and consensus in the Parliament around this issue; urges the Scottish Government to listen to, and actively involve, children and young people in the development and delivery of educational, social, leisure and health services, and believes that it is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s responsibility to research the extent and reasons for such barriers and that the voices of children and young people with additional support needs should form a central part of the inspection processes that these services undergo.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-878</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Anti-Bullying Week 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Anti-Bullying Week 2007, the theme of which is &quot;Cyberbullying, schools and the community&quot;; notes that Anti-Bullying Week has in the past few years had great success in raising awareness of this issue and looked at practical solutions under the themes of &quot;Bystander&quot; and &quot;children and young people&rsquo;s participation - involving children and young people in tackling bullying&quot;; believes that these events are of great importance in helping to tackle a problem that affects a great number of people not only in schools but also in the wider community; hopes that as organisations such as Respectme<em>, </em>Scotland&rsquo;s anti-bullying service, become more widely known the vision set out by Respectme of a respecting, just, equal and inclusive Scotland in which all children and young people can live free from bullying and harassment and are encouraged to reach their full potential will be achieved, and wishes it every success in this endeavour.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-877</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Liberal Democrat Plans for Scottish Water</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the suggestion by the leader of the Liberal Democrats that he intends to amend the Scottish budget to mutualise Scottish Water; considers that this proposal has not been thought through; notes that Scottish Water cannot be mutualised or privatised through the budget process and that any reduction by the Liberal Democrat or Labour party in the funding allocated by the Scottish Government to Scottish Water will lead to increased water charges for all Scottish taxpayers, including pensioners, and urges the Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties to state clearly which public services they intend to cut in any attack on the Scottish budget.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-876#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Democratic Deficit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern for the rights of democratically elected members of Glasgow City Council and the residents they represent as a result of Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s ruling Labour administration preventing open and democratic debate of important issues to Glasgow at the special Glasgow City Council meeting on 15 November 2007, called to discuss business that was curtailed at the previous meeting, by voting to end the meeting before the first motion had even been debated in the face of opposition from SNP, Green and Conservative councillors and before important issues concerning services for young people, the impact of the 2012 Olympics on lottery funding and housing for asylum seekers and refugees could be debated; notes that such actions do nothing to foster political co-operation to the detriment of both the council and, more importantly, the people of Glasgow, and believes that, as a means to creating an effective working environment in which the interests of the people of Glasgow are put first, such petty and juvenile actions should be seriously reviewed before more valuable time is used up without real debate being able to take place.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-874</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Moose in the Hoose</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &quot;Moose In The Hoose&quot; project aimed at introducing the benefits of computers and the internet to those living in care homes and sheltered housing in Edinburgh using retired and senior volunteers; congratulates the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s Department of Health and Social Care, Community Service Volunteer&rsquo;s Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme (RSVP) and Age Concern&rsquo;s Edinburgh Information Technology (ACE IT) based in the Gorgie and Dalry area on jointly bringing this project to fruition; believes that it is vital that no section of society is left behind by technological developments, and further believes that this important social inclusion project is an example of good practice to the rest of Scotland and beyond.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-873</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Threatened Closure of the King&rsquo;s Theatre in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the King&rsquo;s Theatre in Edinburgh faces closure following a decision by the City of Edinburgh Council not to fund a refurbishment plan until at least 2010; notes the comments of the Chief Executive of the Festival City Theatres Trust which runs the venue on the council&rsquo;s behalf that such a delay threatens the King&rsquo;s Theatre with closure on health and safety grounds within two years; recognises the important contribution that the Tollcross venue has made in its 101-year history to the cultural life of Edinburgh, the Lothians and the east of Scotland and which continues today, including its role in Edinburgh&rsquo;s festivals; believes that funding for refurbishment should be prioritised accordingly, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to enter into funding negotiations with the Scottish Government and the Festival City Theatres Trust with a view to securing a viable future for the King&rsquo;s Theatre.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-871*#*</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Carers&rsquo; Respite and Short Breaks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 7 December 2007 is Carers&rsquo; Rights Day; applauds the huge contribution made to society by more than 600,000 unpaid carers in Scotland; welcomes the work done by organisations such as Grangemouth Carers and the Falkirk Carers Centre; recognises the enormous benefit that the provision of respite and short break services can make to both the carer and the cared for; notes with concern the inequalities of access to respite provision recently highlighted by the Scottish Society for Autism; believes that regular updates should be made available, detailing progress towards the provision of an additional 10,000 weeks respite per year, as well as a guaranteed annual entitlement to breaks from caring by 2011; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on its new respite care guidance; is concerned, however, that this guidance does not contain a duty on local authorities to develop specific respite strategies; believes that such a duty is vital to strengthen the development of respite services and to achieve equality of access across Scotland, and believes that, in the absence of a duty on local authorities, measures should be taken to ensure that the impact of any additional resources for respite services is not undermined by weaknesses in local respite planning.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-868*#*</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Standing United with Glasgow&rsquo;s Pakistani Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is united with members of the Glasgow Pakistani community who protested outside the Pakistan Vice-Consulate&rsquo;s office in Glasgow in November 2007; shares their concerns over the emergency rule imposed by General Musharraf in Pakistan; joins in their calls demanding that the rule of law is adhered to, the judiciary is reinstated and free and fair elections are held as scheduled in January 2008, and considers that representations should be made to Westminster on their behalf and that appropriate pressure be applied to General Musharraf to comply with the democratic wishes of the Pakistani community.</p>
