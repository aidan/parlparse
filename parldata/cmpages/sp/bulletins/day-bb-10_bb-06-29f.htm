<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6669 Margaret Smith: Congratulations to Craigroyston Community High School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Craigroyston Community High School, which was placed first in the United Kingdom and 32nd worldwide in the World Maths Day challenge; considers that the result reflects the hard work and dedication of pupils, teachers, support staff and senior management at the school; acknowledges the positive impact that participation in such challenges has on pupils&rsquo; learning and confidence; believes that the new school building, which was formally opened on 12 May 2010, is having a constructive effect on all members of the school, and hopes that the school continues to go from strength to strength in its new surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6668 Karen Whitefield: Tollbrae and Calderbank Partnership Primary Schools&rsquo; Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Tollbrae and Calderbank Partnership Primary Schools&rsquo; pupils on the success of their recent production of <em>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</em>; commends both the pupils and staff on the high standard of the performance and acknowledges the hard work exhibited by all involved in the production; pays tribute to the hard work and commitment of Mrs Joyce Dalzell, who is departing the school after several years of dedicated service as a classroom assistant; recognises that she will be greatly missed by pupils and staff alike, and wishes her every success for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6667 Christine Grahame: Borders Rail Full Steam Ahead</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the commitment of the Scottish Government to the reinstatement of the Borders Railway with stops at Tweedbank, Galashiels, Stow, Gorebridge, Newtongrange, Eskbank and Shawfair and considers that the Liberal Democrat, Conservative, Labour, Green and Independent support in the Parliament for the Edinburgh tram project was wholly misguided, is costing the Scottish public purse dear and should never have proceeded.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6666 John Park: Meeting the Low-carbon Skills Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the response by the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils (ASSC) in Scotland to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Towards a Low Carbon Economy for Scotland: Discussion Paper</em>; further welcomes the work done by the ASSC toward meeting the low-carbon skills challenge and in developing qualifications that meet the requirements of employers in low-carbon industries; considers that more must be done to raise private sector awareness of the opportunities, both domestic and international, afforded by a move to a low-carbon world economy, and hopes that the specific challenges highlighted by the ASSC in Scotland will be considered by the Scottish Government as the consultation process goes forward.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6665 Robin Harper: Edinburgh Farmers&rsquo; Market Celebrates 10th Birthday</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh Farmers&rsquo; Market on the occasion of its 10th birthday; notes the superb local produce that Edinburgh Farmers&rsquo; Market offers and the hard work done by the stallholders to make this an award-winning market; further notes that this is despite the fact that stall charges are the highest in Scotland; recognises that the majority of stallholders grow what they sell; congratulates John Scott MSP for his work in developing farmers&rsquo; markets across Scotland, and wishes the Edinburgh Farmers&rsquo; Market continued success during its second decade.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6664 Hugh Henry: Regressive VAT Rise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the comments made by Danny Alexander MP, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, that the emergency Budget, the rise in VAT included, is progressive; notes previous comments by the Prime Minister, David Cameron MP, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg MP, when in opposition that VAT is regressive, and regrets the apparent lack of understanding by someone in such an important position in the Treasury.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6652 Marilyn Livingstone: Construction Courses in Colleges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by North Highland College to stop its roof slating and tiling course at its Alness campus despite sufficient demand for the course; acknowledges that, if the proposals are implemented, there will be no such course provision north of Arbroath; recognises that Arbroath College takes on only 14 apprentices for roof slating and tiling per year and, other than this small provision, those wishing to enrol on these courses must travel to the central belt for college training; considers that North Highland College will not receive any additional funding for running the course as it can reach its capped funding without it and that in the current economic climate if the course is stopped it will be very unlikely that it will be reinstated in the near future; is concerned that this could be the start of construction courses being terminated as colleges try to make savings, and believes that, if the Scottish Government is committed to linking procurement to training, it must secure adequate construction training facilities throughout Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6652.1 Dave Thompson: Construction Courses in Colleges</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6652) in the name of Marilyn Livingstone, leave out from &quot;and that&quot; to end and insert &quot;, and commends ConstructionSkills, the Scottish Funding Council and Skills Development Scotland, which have all engaged constructively with Dave Thompson MSP to try to find a solution to this problem that would allow the course to be maintained in Alness&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6608 Stuart McMillan: Action Mesothelioma Day, 2 July 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the fifth annual Action Mesothelioma Day, on 2 July, to raise awareness of the disease and improve the treatment and care of it; notes the dedication of charities such as Clydeside Action on Asbestos that, this National Mesothelioma Day, are hosting the first ever day for patients and carers; acknowledges that the Scottish Parliament has an excellent record of supporting those with asbestos-related conditions, as evidenced by the passing of Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Act 2008, and recognises the importance of this day as many individuals and families living in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been affected by exposure to asbestos.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6608.1 Des McNulty: Action Mesothelioma Day, 2 July 2010</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6608) in the name of Stuart McMillan, after &quot;such as&quot; insert &quot;Clydebank Asbestos Group and&quot;.</p>
