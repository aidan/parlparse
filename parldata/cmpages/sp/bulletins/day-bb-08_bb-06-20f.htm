<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2172</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Funding Cuts by Scottish Government to Glasgow Science Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled at the decision of the Scottish Government to cut the funding of the Glasgow Science Centre (GSC) from &pound;1.7 million in 2007-08 to &pound;1.4 million in 2008-09 and to &pound;1.08 million in 2009-10; notes the international standing of GSC which is one of only three science centres in the United Kingdom to be a full member of the Association of Science-Technology Centres (ASTC) and that GSC has been awarded five star status by VisitScotland; notes further that GSC serves schools and communities through inreach and outreach in every local authority area in Scotland; is concerned that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s new funding method takes no account of the breadth or quality of the experience offered at GSC; contrasts the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning&rsquo;s bold statement that the Scottish Government will tackle poor levels of science achievement in Scotland with the reality of SNP Government cuts in the funding of Scotland&rsquo;s only international standard science centre; is concerned at the lengthy lack of engagement with GSC over the proposals, and calls on Scottish Ministers to reinstate the previous levels of funding to GSC to enable it to continue to bring a rich experience and interest in science to young people across Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2172.1</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Funding Cuts by Scottish Government to Glasgow Science Centre</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2172) in the name of Robert Brown, leave out from &quot;is appalled&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the new funding package for Scottish science centres which ensured that Scotland&rsquo;s four centres received support beyond March 2008; notes that the new funding package was welcomed by all centres, including the Chairman and Chief Executive of Glasgow Science Centre; further notes that since government funding of the Scottish science centres began in 2004-05, Glasgow Science Centre has received &pound;5.4 million compared with &pound;2.5 million to the other centres combined and, although it has received 72% of government funding in recent years, Glasgow Science Centre has only attracted 45% of visitors across the Scottish Science Centres Network, and acknowledges that the new funding package is a fairer and more equitable basis for dividing available funding between all the Scottish centres and demonstrates the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to the future of all the centres.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2138</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Sense or Census</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the possible consequences of the 2011 Census contract being awarded to the US defence group, Lockheed Martin; notes that under the terms of the US Patriot Act which allows US law enforcement bodies to demand public information from private sector companies, detailed personal information on UK citizens could be handed over to US authorities and used for covert intelligence and surveillance work, and believes that assurances from the UK Government that provisions will be made to ensure that this does not happen, which have been dismissed by the Treasury Select Committee, could lead to many citizens boycotting the census or giving false evidence which in turn would render the census useless in terms of its objectives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2138.1</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Sense or Census</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2138) in the name of Bill Kidd, leave out from &quot;possible consequences&quot; to end and insert &quot;scaremongering on issues concerning the 2011 Census contract and has every confidence in the General Register Office for Scotland in delivering a contract for the Census that will ensure the protection of the data in the same way as every previous census and retains the full confidence of every citizen participating in the Census.&quot;</p>
