    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-652#</b> <strong>Mrs Margaret Smith: Firework Sales</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament believes that, given the level of injuries and distress to people and animals
    and the public nuisance caused by the sale of fireworks to the public, pressure should be
    applied to the UK government to limit such sales, that local authorities should be
    encouraged to control availability of fireworks through the use of local by-laws, and that
    it should be made an offence to pass fireworks on to a minor.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-651</b> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Rohypnol Drug Properities</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with concern the properties of the drug rohypnol manufactured by
    Hoffman La Roche and commonly known as the &quot;date rape&quot; drug or the &quot;forget
    pill&quot; given that the sedative effects are seven to ten times greater than valium;
    calls for an investigation into rohypnol, highlighting criminal cases where the drug has
    been used, and calls upon the manufacturer to colour code the drug to assist forensic
    detection given that the small white tablet is not easily detectable.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-650</b> <strong>George Lyon: National Park Status For Argyll Forest Park</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament supports the inclusion of Argyll Forest Park within the boundaries of the
    first new National Park in Scotland (Loch Lomond and Trossachs); notes the real benefits
    that will flow to the Cowal economy from increased tourism and leisure and, most
    importantly, recognises the huge impact the National Park would have in rebranding the
    Cowal peninsula for the 21st century. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-642.1</b> <strong>Mr John Swinney: Created in Scotland - The Way Forward
    for Manufacturing in the 21st Century</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-642) in the
    name of Henry McLeish, insert at end &quot;but recognises that appropriate UK
    macro-economic decisions must also be taken to ensure the prosperity of the manufacturing
    sector in Scotland.&quot;<i><strong> </strong></i></p>
