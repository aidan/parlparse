    <p ALIGN="left"><a name="610"></a>*S1M-610</b> <strong>David McLetchie: European Convention on
    Human Rights</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the disruption to
    Scotland&#146;s judicial system resulting from Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s
    decision to directly incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into Scots
    Law without having paid due attention to the consequences; further notes that the
    Convention now impacts directly upon the legislative competence of the Parliament and the
    powers of the Scottish Executive and from October 2000 will apply to all public
    authorities in Scotland; calls upon the Scottish Executive to provide, at the earliest
    opportunity, a full report to the Parliament on the impact of incorporation to date and a
    statement on the Executive&#146;s state of preparedness for October when the Convention
    becomes fully operational, and further calls upon the Scottish Executive to provide a full
    and detailed analysis of the ECHR implications of legislative proposals submitted to the
    Parliament and to consider establishing a Human Rights Commission or some other body to
    provide expert advice and guidance on the impact of the ECHR on public authorities in
    Scotland.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-609</b> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Entry of Convicted Rapists into the UK</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament condemns the recent events involving Mike Tyson being allowed into Britain;
    acknowledges the speculation that he intends to fight again in the United Kingdom,
    possibly at Ibrox and calls upon the Home Secretary to firstly, treat all convicted
    rapists who are seeking entry into the United Kingdom equally by refusing them entry,
    secondly, to show respect to all victims of rape by banning Mike Tyson from ever entering
    the United Kingdom again in any capacity and thirdly, not to base his judgement in the
    future on financial concerns.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-608</b> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Theory on Rape</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament condemns the claims of the book <i>A Natural History of Rape, The Biological
    Bases of Sexual Coercion</i> which excuses rape as a simple mating technique; finds the
    conclusions of this book deeply offensive to both women and men; strongly believes that
    the theory which forms the basis of this publication, that human males have evolved the
    desire to rape whenever their desire to mate is thwarted, is both dangerous and deeply
    flawed and calls upon the Scottish Executive to take action to ensure that the theory
    promoted through this publication is not adopted as a defence against the charge of rape.</p>

    the Gaelic language, in particular its support for Gaelic-medium education; recognises the
    cultural, economic and social contribution of Gaelic to Scotland; supports the Scottish
    Executive&#146;s participation in the Columba Initiative (Iomairt Chaluim Chille) to
    strengthen the links between the Gaelic-speaking communities of Scotland and of Ireland,
    and commends the work of local authorities, schools, colleges, universities and voluntary
    bodies in making available Gaelic-medium education at all levels from pre-school to
    tertiary and continuing education and in promoting the Gaelic arts.</p>

    Parliament notes the success of Peterhead Prison and the wide recognition it has received
    throughout the 1990s for developing the STOP programme for sex offenders and for its work
    over recent years; congratulates the prison officers, other staff and the local community
    on their efforts in building that success, and believes that it would be foolish in the
    extreme to in any way jeopardise the success of that programme with uncertainties over the
    future of the prison.</p>

    upon the Scottish Executive, the Scotland Office and the Northern Ireland Office to work
    together to secure an alternative operator for the route for the coming season and beyond.</p>

    main recommendations, establishing a National Care Commission, has recently been
    initiated, and that not in full, and urges the Scottish Executive as a matter of urgency

    recommendations to reflect the respect and value that the Parliament places on elderly
    people in society.</b></p>
