<STRONG>Bristow Muldoon: Congratulations to Chris Hoy</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
sends its congratulations to Chris Hoy following his latest success in becoming 
World Champion in the 1km time trial cycling event at Copenhagen on 26 September 
2002; recognises that this is the latest in an on-going series of achievements 
by Scottish cyclists dating back to the 1970s, and believes that the future success 
of cyclists in Scotland would be enhanced by the Scottish Executive and <STRONG>sport</STRONG>scotland 
working with representatives of the sport to develop all-weather cycling facilities 
in Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3439</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: Homelessness 
etc. (Scotland) Bill - Financial Resolution</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament, 
for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Homelessness 
etc. (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure payable out of the 
Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3438</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Christine Grahame: Justice 1 Committee, Report on the Prison Estates Review</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the 6th<SUP> </SUP>Report, 2002 of the Justice 1 Committee, 
<em>Report on the Prison Estates Review</em> (SP Paper 612).</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3437#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Celebration of 400th Anniversary of Union of the Crowns</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament recognises that the 400th anniversary of the Union of the Crowns 
will occur in 2003, an event in which the King of Scotland, James VI, acceded 
to the English throne and became the monarch of Britain; notes that this ultimately 
led to the Union of the Parliaments in 1707 and over 250 years of peace between 
the ancient nations of Britain and brought increased prosperity and widened opportunities 
for Scots in the United Kingdom and abroad, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
and other public bodies should bring forward a programme of events to mark this 
important date in Scottish and English history.</P><P>Supported by: John Scott<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Murdo Fraser<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3436</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Andy

<STRONG>*S1M-3435#</STRONG> <STRONG>Johann Lamont: National Construction Week 
3-10 October 2002 and the Contribution of Women to the Construction Industry</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes National Construction Week to be held from 3-10 October 
2002 and, in particular, the emphasis on the contribution of women to the construction 
industry and how this can be improved upon and notes with pleasure the decision 
of Glasgow City Council to hold a seminar devoted to that issue in the course 
of National Construction Week.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3434#</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Adam 
Ingram: In-Service Teacher Training - Child Psychology</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament recognises the value of comprehensive in-service training for teachers 
in identifying social, emotional, behavioural and learning difficulties which 
can have a significant impact on a child&#146;s development if not detected and 
referred for treatment at an early stage and notes that the current provision 
and levels of training are not sufficient in addressing this issue.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3433</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Proposed New National Stadium in Wembley</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with concern the proposed new national stadium at Wembley 
and its projected cost of £750 million; believes that this will be a waste of 
public money, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her 
Majesty&#146;s Government to reconsider this project and instead consider favourably 
the Birmingham alternative, which satisfies all the criteria for the new stadium 
but at less than half the cost.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3432</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy 
Sheridan: Arrest of Lesley McCulloch in Indonesia</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
expresses its deep concern at the fate of the Scottish-born academic Lesley McCulloch, 
working in Australia, who has been arrested in Indonesia and calls on the Scottish 
Executive to raise her case urgently with the Foreign Secretary with a view to 
securing her release.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3430#</STRONG> <STRONG>Brian Adam: Safety 
Campaign on Diesel Spills</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes with regret 
the distressing number of motorcycle accidents and fatalities caused by diesel 
spills and believes that the Scottish Executive should run a road safety campaign 
to highlight the dangers of over-filling diesel tanks and introduce other measures 
to reduce diesel spills.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3429 Mr Mike Rumbles on behalf of the 
Standards Committee: Replacing the Members' Interest Order: Proposal for a Committee 
Bill</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament agrees to the proposal for a Committee 
Bill under Rule 9.15 contained in the Standards Committee&#146;s 7th Report 2002, 
<em>Replacing the Members&#146; Interests Order: Proposal for a Committee Bill</em>, 
(SP Paper 621). </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3428 Mr Mike Rumbles on behalf of the Standards 
Committee: Lobbying</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the recommendations 
of the Standards Committee&#146;s 1st Report 2002, <em>Lobbying</em>, (SP Paper 
507) and agrees to amend section 7 of the <em>Code of Conduct for Members of the 
Scottish Parliament</em> as set out in Annex E of the report. </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3427#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Oban Firefighters</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes the commitment and dedication of the retained firefighters in Oban; respects 
their view that a no strike policy is in the best interests of the people of North 
Argyll; recognises their concerns with regard to the restructuring of the Oban 
firefighting capacity; notes that recruitment for the new operation is running 
at less than 20% of required capacity, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
should reappraise the situation with a degree of urgency.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3426#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Scottish Road Maintenance Survey</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the Scottish Road Maintenance Condition Survey by the Society 
of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland (SCOTS) which will evaluate the 
non-trunk road network across Scotland; welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
involvement in and support for this project, along with the funding that it has 
already provided to local authorities in order to help tackle problems in respect 
of such roads; recognises that for a number of decades the non-trunk roads network 
has suffered from under-investment, while the number of vehicles using such roads 
has dramatically increased, and considers that, following its publication, the 
Scottish Executive should use the SCOTS report as a basis for allocating resources 
according to the needs identified, providing a long-term funding programme for 
the non-trunk road network in Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3426.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr 
Brian Monteith: Scottish Road Maintenance Survey</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment 
to motion (S1M-3426) in the name of Dr Sylvia Jackson, <A NAME="AmendmentText">leave 
out from &quot;, along&quot; to end and insert &quot;; further notes that the 
net capital spend on the construction and improvement of local roads totalled 
£562 million in the four years up to 1997, compared to £326 million in the four 
subsequent years to 2001, and welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Conservative 
Party to allocate an additional £100 million each year to invest in new roads 
and improving the condition of our existing trunk, motorway and local needs network.&quot;</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3424#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Shona Robison: Retailing of Fireworks by RS McColl</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with concern the decision of the head office of the retailer 
RS McColl to issue a memo to all its outlets in Scotland asking them to display 
window posters advertising half-price fireworks six weeks before 5 November; considers 
this action to be a flagrant breach of the voluntary code of practice, which restricts 
advertising to within three weeks of Guy Fawkes' night; considers that RS McColl 
should reconsider the decision and set an example to other retailers by removing 
such window posters from their retail outlets in recognition of the voluntary 
code, and believes that this situation highlights the pressing need for the law 
on retailing of fireworks to be tightened through the introduction of a licensing 
system.</P><P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Alex Neil, Mr Andrew Welsh</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3419#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Michael Matheson: Closure of Prison Officers' Social Club at HM Prison 
Polmont</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the decision by the Scottish Prison 
Service (SPS) to close the officers&#146; social club at HM Prison Polmont and 
considers that SPS should withdraw this decision and honour its commitment to 
allow the club to purchase the property, recognising the important role of the 
club to both staff and the local community.</P><P>Supported by: Andrew Wilson, 
Mr Gil Paterson, Stewart Stevenson, Alex Neil, Tommy Sheridan, Cathy Peattie, 
Dennis Canavan<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3417#</STRONG> <STRONG>Christine 
Grahame: Borders College</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
the current financial difficulties of Borders College with the proposals to close 
its Hawick campus; further notes the Audit Scotland report, <em>Overview of Further 
Education Colleges in Scotland 2000/2001</em>, and the subsequent report by the 
Audit Committee, <em>Report on Overview of Further Education Colleges in Scotland 
1999-2000</em>, which both highlighted the severe revenue and capital problems 
facing further education colleges; is particularly aware of the special difficulties 
in the funding formulae which fail to address the funding difficulties in rural 
areas, and considers that the Scottish Executive should review the whole funding 
method for further education colleges as a matter of urgency.</P><P>Supported 
by: Alex Neil, Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3416#</STRONG> <STRONG>Shona Robison: 
Licensing Scheme for Fireworks</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament agrees with the 
view of the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland in calling for the tightening 
up of legislation relating to the sale and use of fireworks; notes that the association 
specifically refers to a need for sellers to be stringently vetted in order to 
ensure that applicants for a certificate to sell fireworks are of good character 
and should be required to show "need" before being granted a certificate; believes 
that the best way of achieving this is through the introduction of a licensing 
scheme for vendors of fireworks, and considers that the Scottish Executive should, 
as part of the current review of licensing powers under the Civic Government (Scotland) 
Act 1982, consider extending licensing powers to include firework vendors.</P><P>Supported 
by: Alex Neil, Mr Andrew Welsh, Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3415#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Cathy Peattie: Firefighters' Pay Formula</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes the changes in the duties of firefighters since their current pay formula 
was established and, in particular, the greater skills firefighters now require, 
the additional hazards they face and the changes in the workforce on which their 
pay formula comparison is based, and believes that these factors should be addressed 
by a new formula for firefighters&#146; pay.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Duncan McNeil,

Home Robertson, Maureen Macmillan, Cathie Craigie, Helen Eadie, Jackie Baillie,

<STRONG>S1M-3386 Mr Mike Rumbles on behalf of the Standards Committee: Code of 
Conduct for Members of the Scottish Parliament: Disclosure of Complaints</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament agrees to amend paragraph 10.2.1 of the Code of Conduct for Members 
of the Scottish Parliament as follows: leave out &quot;MSPs should not communicate 
any complaint to the press or other media until a decision has been made as to 
how the complaint is to be dealt with&quot; and insert: </P><P></P><P><STRONG>&quot;Disclosure 
of Complaints</STRONG></P><P></P><P>10.2.1A Members should not disclose, communicate 
or discuss any complaint or intention to make a complaint with members of the 
press or media prior to the lodging of the complaint or while the Standards Committee 
is receiving assistance from an adviser appointed under paragraph 10.2.8 in relation 
to the complaint. The Standards Committee is to be regarded as receiving the assistance 
of an adviser appointed under paragraph 10.2.8 in relation to a complaint until 
it has confirmed that no assistance or further assistance from any such adviser 
will be sought. Where, during the period when the restriction applies, any complaint 
or intention to make a complaint has been publicised in the press or media without 
the involvement of the Member who is the subject of the complaint, that Member 
may issue a brief statement. In doing so, a Member should, as far as possible, 
avoid discussing details of the complaint or intention to make a complaint.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3355

<STRONG>George Lyon: Gourock to Dunoon Ferry Service</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes with concern the Executive proposal to restrict Gourock to Dunoon ferry 
services to passenger-only in the draft Invitation to Tender for Clyde and Hebrides 
ferry services currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne; further notes that 
this proposal undermines action to upgrade Dunoon pier and transport links at 
Gourock pier; further notes the total opposition of the local community to this 
proposal, and considers that the Executive should find an alternative proposal 
that includes a vehicle-carrying ferry and satisfies European competition rules.</P><P>Supported 
by: Robin Harper, Donald Gorrie</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3263#</STRONG> <STRONG>Lord 
James Douglas-Hamilton: Development of RAF Turnhouse Site</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament notes that BAA Lynton has earmarked the former RAF Turnhouse site or 
&quot;Airwest&quot; for medium- to long-term commercial development in support 
of the expanding cargo operations at Edinburgh Airport following the grant of 
outline planning consent in June 2000; further notes that the entire site is currently 
being marketed to potential commercial occupiers for a variety of airport-related 
uses; expresses its concern that Home Office plans for a possible accommodation 
centre for asylum seekers on that site are creating uncertainty and thus the site 
is in danger of becoming blighted, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive 
and the City of Edinburgh Council should ask the Home Office to state clearly 
that it has no interest in the site and thereby permit BAA Lynton to proceed with 
its plans which are in the best interest of jobs and economic development in Edinburgh 
and the east of Scotland.</P><P>Supported by: David McLetchie, Margaret Smith,
