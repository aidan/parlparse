         <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2620#</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes:</strong> <strong>Special Olympics Great Britain National Summer Games 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Special Olympics Great Britain National Summer Games 2005 are to be held in Glasgow from 2 to 9 July 2005; welcomes to Scotland the 2,500 athletes with learning disabilities who will participate in 23 sports at 11 venues throughout the city; notes that this will be the biggest sporting event to take place in Great Britain in 2005, and hopes that the games will demonstrate Glasgow&rsquo;s ability to host such events in support of the city&rsquo;s potential bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2619</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Meeting the Needs and Aspirations of the People of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that its members&rsquo; primary function is to reflect and address the needs and aspirations of the people of Scotland.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2618</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Pension Rebate Gender Discrimination</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the one-off council tax rebate promised to pensioners by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; further notes that this will not apply to roughly 40,000 female pensioners in Scotland; concurs with the view expressed by Help The Aged Scotland that &quot;This one-off payment is a grotty little bribe, but even worse it is also sexist and ageist&quot;, and believes that, if a rebate is to be given to pensioners, it should be done in a more equal fashion and should not discriminate against one group in this way.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2617</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Housing (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Housing (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2616</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Bridging the Gap</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the research report by the Scottish Consumer Council, <em>Bridging the gap: Improving access to primary healthcare services for disabled people</em>, which examined how primary healthcare providers have responded to the needs of disabled people; notes with some concern the disappointment of the Scottish Consumer Council that it did not find more evidence of good practice in this area; calls on all of Scotland&rsquo;s primary healthcare providers to implement the checklist aimed at primary care practitioners as a step to improving good practice, and urges the Scottish Executive to do far more to promote change among primary healthcare providers as a way of ensuring the needs of disabled people are heard and adhered to.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2615#</strong> <strong>Mike Watson:</strong> <strong>Protecting Land Used for Organised Sport and Other Forms of Physical Activity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing diminution in the number of sports pitches and open space across Scotland, despite the efforts of <strong>sport</strong>scotland and the National Playing Fields Association Scotland; believes that this will make it more difficult for the Scottish Executive to achieve its stated aim of improving the health of young people in Scotland and reducing levels of obesity; endorses the need, as expressed in the report of the Physical Activity Task Force, for all primary and secondary pupils to have a minimum of two hours each week of quality physical education, and considers that the Executive should ensure that more robust measures are introduced to the planning process to protect land used for organised sport and other forms of physical activity<font color="#0000ff">.</font></p>

         <p><strong>S2M-2612#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Crisis of Management in Kilmarnock Prison</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Minister for Justice should adopt a proactive approach, rather than her current complacent one, to dealing with the crisis of management in Kilmarnock Prison; believes that, if she continues to ignore this problem, she will lose the confidence of the Scottish people and this Parliament; further believes that the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service has failed to ensure that the contract between Premier Prison Services and the Scottish Prison Service for the running of Kilmarnock Prison is being properly implemented and that he has totally ignored the breaches of contract, illegal activities and morally-decadent behaviour which are occurring in the prison, as well as failing to ensure that suicide watches have been properly carried out and monitored, as a result of which there has been an unnecessary and avoidable loss of life; believes that he should resign forthwith and that the Chief Inspector of Prisons should launch an immediate, open and transparent investigation into the allegations made in the BBC documentary into Kilmarnock Prison, broadcast on 9 March 2005, and further believes that the latest report of the Chief Inspector of Prisons into Kilmarnock Prison should be published immediately.</p>

         <p><strong>S2M-2606</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s School Meals Programme and On-line Petition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Jamie Oliver and Channel 4 on the excellent programme &quot;Jamie&rsquo;s School Dinners&quot; which concluded on 16 March 2005; believes that Mr Oliver has put the Westminster Government to shame in highlighting the devastating state of school food served to children in England and the consequent threat to the future health of an entire generation and, in doing so, has underlined the urgent need for government intervention; notes the petition launched by Mr Oliver&rsquo;s website which urges people to sign up to the following statement: &quot;I believe kids need a healthy diet so we need to change school dinners to ban the junk and get fresh, nutritious meals back on the plate. I support the Feed Me Better campaign&quot;; further notes that within two days of the petition being launched, well over 50,000 people have already signed, with the number of signatures going up by the second; congratulates Hull City Council on its three-year pilot programme of providing free and healthy school breakfasts, dinners and after-school snacks to all primary schoolchildren, and the Welsh Assembly on its free school breakfasts policy for all children, and looks forward to Glasgow City Council carrying out its manifesto promise to provide free, nutritious school meals to all primary schoolchildren in Glasgow by 2007.</p>
