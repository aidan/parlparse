<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Forestry&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3727</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Forestry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the unanimous recommendation of the Rural and Environment Committee that the Scottish Government drop proposals for leasing up to 25% of the Forestry Commission estate for a period of 75 years; welcomes the decision of the Scottish Government to amend the Climate Change Bill to remove the relevant clauses,&nbsp;and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward its review of the operation of the Scotland Rural Development Programme urgently, including reviewing the level awarded for grants, and to pursue proposals for joint ventures to deliver renewables projects in the Forestry Commission estate. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3727.3</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3727) in the name of Sarah Boyack, after &quot;years&quot; insert &quot;; notes that the Forestry Commission makes a major contribution to the economy of Scotland and can also make a major contribution towards helping Scotland meet its climate change targets&quot;.</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3727.2</strong> <strong>John Scott: Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3727) in the name of Sarah Boyack, insert at end &quot;and considers that all forestry proposals in future must be part of an integrated land-use strategy.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3727.4</strong> <strong>Jim Hume: Forestry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3727) in the name of Sarah Boyack, insert at end &quot;and further calls on the Scottish Government to introduce a comprehensive sustainable land-use strategy, taking into account the strategic economic, social and environmental impacts and benefits of forestry, agriculture, recreation and other land uses and setting out, where appropriate, the contribution each can make in dealing with the consequences of climate change.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Police Numbers&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3726</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Police Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Scottish Government must ensure that there are 17,265 full-time equivalent police officers by March 2011, calculated on the basis currently used by the Chief Statistician in the reporting of the official Police Officer Quarterly Strength Statistics, for the SNP&rsquo;s stated manifesto pledge for 1,000 more police officers to be met. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3726.1</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill: Police Numbers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3726) in the name of Richard Baker, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that police officer numbers are at a record high; welcomes the findings of the Police Force Projection Study that show that by March 2011 police officer numbers will have increased by more than 1,000 over the March 2007 level and will reach between 17,275 and 17,484 officers; commends the Scottish Government for its investment in funding 1,000 additional recruits; further commends the eight Scottish police forces for delivering additional police officers, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue to maximise the total number of police officers through a combination of recruitment, retention and redeployment.&quot; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-3726.1.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> Police Numbers&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-3726.1) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from first &quot;commends&quot; to &quot;further&quot; and insert &quot;notes that this figure has been achieved as a result of the funding secured by the Scottish Conservatives in the 2008-09 budget negotiations;&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>S3M-3726.2</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Police Numbers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3726) in the name of Richard Baker, insert at end &quot;; notes the Police Force Projection Study carried out by the Scottish Government estimating that police officer numbers are likely to be between 17,275 and 17,484 by 31 March 2011; notes that the SNP&rsquo;s attempt to alter its commitment to the delivery of the equivalent of 1,000 officers would not have achieved this result; welcomes the fact that the Scottish Government was forced by opposition parties and public opinion to firm up its commitment; regrets the Scottish Government&rsquo;s repeated efforts to confuse and obfuscate the figures, noting that, as recently as 3 March 2009, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice cast further doubt on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s intention and ability to achieve the target, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland to retain skills and expertise in the police force through appropriate workforce planning and ensure that police officers are working effectively and visibly in Scotland&rsquo;s local communities.&quot;</p>
