            <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Raw Deal for Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the decision of the Minister for Finance and Local Government 
            to present Glasgow with a percentage increase in Aggregate External 
            Finance for 2001-02 to 2003-04 which is substantially below the Scottish 
            average; is aware that Glasgow in financial year 2003-2004 will receive 
            £72 per capita less in real terms than in 1996-97; notes that council 
            tax in Glasgow has risen by 36% since 1996-97, compared to the Scottish 
            average of 25.1% over that period, taking it from the third highest 
            to the highest in Scotland and that, according to the City Council 
            itself, council tax will have to rise by twice the rate of inflation 
            to prevent service cuts in 2001-02, placing an unfair burden on Glasgow's 
            already hard-pressed council tax payers; is aware that Glasgow has 
            already had to implement service cuts of £242.7 million from 1996-97 
            to 2000-2001 and shed 2327 full-time equivalent posts, net, from December 
            1996 to September 1999; appreciates that Glasgow has, in common with 
            other councils, had to fund new burdens, such as self-financing pay 
            awards and new statutory responsibilities such as those imposed by 
            the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 in recent years; accepts that Glasgow 
            has more than half of Scotland's areas of deprivation with only 12% 
            of its population and that it requires resourcing that reflects this; 
            agrees with Glasgow City Council's leader that the Scottish Executive 
            is &quot;walking away from its own social inclusion agenda&quot; in 
            relation to its 2001-02 to 2003-04 local government settlement for 
            Glasgow, and urges the Scottish Executive to act immediately to ensure 
            that Glasgow City Council's 2001-02 to 2003-04 local government funding 
            settlement is increased to a level commensurate with Glasgow's economic 
            and social needs. </font></p>
