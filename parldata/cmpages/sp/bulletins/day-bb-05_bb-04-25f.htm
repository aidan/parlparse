That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-2727</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Canadian Seal Cull: Inhumane and Unnecessary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Canadian Government has approved a massive expansion in the allowable catch for harp seals in Canada to a maximum of 975,000 animals over a three-year period; notes that the second phase of Canada&rsquo;s commercial seal hunt began on 14 April 2005 in Newfoundland, under which more than 200,000 seals, 95% under three months old, will be shot or clubbed; notes that, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, tests carried out in previous seasons on cubs that had been clubbed and skinned suggested that up to 42% were still conscious when skinned; further notes that the increase in sealing is directly linked to the decrease in fishing employment following the collapse of commercial fisheries in 1992, that the collapse of commercial fisheries was due to overfishing by humans rather than predation by seals and that there is no clear scientific justification for the seal cull on the basis of fisheries protection; notes that a licence to hunt harp and hooded seals off eastern Canada costs $5 (&pound;2), while a permit to watch someone else kill seals costs $25 (&pound;10) and requires a background check by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and that the estimated landed value of harp seals in 2001 was approximately $5.5 million as opposed to $300 million from tourism; condemns the increased Canadian seal cull as inhumane and ecologically unnecessary, while respecting the right of first nations&rsquo; populations to hunt marine mammals on a sustainable subsistence basis, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make known its grave concerns on the continuation of this cull to the Canadian Government.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2726#</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Supporting Local Producers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the launch of the new farmers&rsquo; market at Stonehaven as a welcome addition to the many thriving markets in the north east of Scotland; acknowledges the continuing popularity and growth of farmers&rsquo; markets, &quot;box&quot; schemes and community-supported agriculture initiatives across the whole of Scotland; recognises that many consumers are becoming increasingly selective about what they eat and are now consciously rejecting mass-produced, remotely-sourced food in favour of fresh seasonal produce that is grown or reared locally; congratulates local farmers and producers for establishing a range of enterprising initiatives to respond to growing consumer demand for such produce in their areas, and considers that shoppers should actively support Stonehaven&rsquo;s initiative and other examples of sustainable local enterprise which benefit the local producer, the local consumer and the local economy.</p>
