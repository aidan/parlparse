<p><strong>S2W-22470 Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish  Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21644 by Patricia Ferguson on 12 January 2006, how this  indicates whether it has ruled out undertaking an independent and detailed  assessment of the costs and benefits to Scotland of the London 2012 Olympic  Games.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-22471 Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive  who appointed Julia Bracewell as the Scottish representative on the  Nations and Regions Group for the London 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-22472 Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish  Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21876 by Patricia Ferguson on 12 January 2006, how the  Scottish Steering Group for London 2012 relates to the Nations and Regions  Group.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-22473 Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish  Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21876 by Patricia Ferguson on 12  January 2006, what action it sees as necessary to ensure &ldquo;that the benefits of  London 2012 are spread across the UK&rdquo;, particularly to Scotland, and to avoid  the findings of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that the UK economy outwith  London will be &pound;2.8 billion worse off if no action is taken.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-22474 Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish  Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21642 by Patricia Ferguson on 13  January 2006, whether this indicates that it has been given no indication that  the decision of the Scottish Football Association not to participate in a  British football team will lead to the withdrawal of Hampden Park as a venue  for the 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-22475 Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has made representations to the organisers  of the London 2012 Olympics to assess the veracity of the statement allegedly  made by a &ldquo;senior figure&rdquo; in the organisation team for that event in respect of  the Scottish Football Association&rsquo;s decision not to participate in a British  football team, &ldquo;Does this make us more inclined to forget about Hampden Park  and consider other options? Sure it does, of course it does&rdquo;, as reported in <em>The  Scotsman</em> on 12 November   2005. </p>
