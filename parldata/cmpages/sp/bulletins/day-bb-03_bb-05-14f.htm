          <p><strong>*S2M-29</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: Threatened Execution 
            of Amina Lawal</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with horror 
            that the Nigerian Supreme Court has upheld the death sentence for 
            Amina Lawal, condemned for the crime of adultery on 19 August 2002, 
            to be buried up to her neck and stoned to death; further notes that 
            this sentence was postponed so that she could continue to nurse her 
            baby but that execution is now set for 3 June 2003; calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to make urgent representations to Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to ask it to intervene with the Nigerian Government to prevent this 
            atrocity, and believes that Nigeria cannot remain part of the Commonwealth 
            and international community if it enforces this sentence.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-28</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Deportation of 
            Ali Serir</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the case of Ali 
            Serir, an Algerian asylum seeker threatened with deportation to Algeria 
            on Friday 16 May 2003; further notes that Ali is married to Karen 
            from Glasgow and has lived in Royston, Glasgow, for the last 18 months 
            and that Karen is expecting their first child in August; condemns 
            the way Ali and Karen were forcibly removed from their home at 5.20am 
            on 6 February 2003 under an anti-terrorist investigation where no 
            charges were made or are pending, and believes that Ali should be 
            granted asylum to live with his wife and child in Glasgow as his life 
            would be in danger if he returned to Algeria, given the very adverse 
            publicity that has now been generated over his arrest and detention.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-27</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Fire Service Dispute</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament applauds the professionalism of Scotland&#146;s fire 
            service personnel who deliver daily a first-class service to Scotland&#146;s 
            citizens; supports the right of free trade unions to negotiate and 
            bargain on behalf of their members and to engage democratically in 
            collective action up to, and including, strike action; rejects any 
            plan to impose a settlement of the current fire service dispute as 
            a profoundly undemocratic and provocative action unacceptable in a 
            modern democracy, and believes that the finance must be found to reward 
            properly the fire service personnel for the essential job they do 
            without reducing the quality and resources of the service.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-26</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Bed Shortages in 
            Glasgow Hospitals</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the survey 
            conducted by Greater Glasgow Health Council which exposed the unacceptable 
            delays that citizens in Glasgow are forced to endure as a direct result 
            of hospital bed shortages throughout the city; further notes that 
            the examples highlighted in the survey included an 81-year-old man 
            kept waiting in the accident and emergency department for five hours 
            for access to a bed after treatment at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and 
            a 91-year-old women kept waiting for four hours for a bed after treatment 
            at Glasgow&#146;s Southern General Hospital; believes that records 
            to detail every person&#146;s visit to an accident and emergency department 
            in Glasgow and across Scotland must be introduced immediately and 
            that no reduction in overnight or acute beds can be afforded in Glasgow 
            without an emergency investigation of the bed shortage problem, and 
            therefore calls for all plans to reduce the availability of acute 
            and overnight beds at the Stobhill and Victoria hospitals to be halted 
            immediately pending an emergency short-term investigation of the number 
            of acute beds required in the city.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-25</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Income Inequality 
            Under New Labour</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the latest 
            statistics from the Office for National Statistics that reveal that 
            income under the New Labour governments is worse than under Margaret 
            Thatcher&#146;s governments from 1979 to 1990; further notes that 
            inequality has grown sharply under New Labour as a direct result of 
            its unwillingness to tax appropriately Britain&#146;s growing band 
            of millionaires and high earners; is aware that the latest figures 
            show that inequality under New Labour is, on average, one sixth higher 
            than the equivalent average under the 11-year government of Margaret 
            Thatcher and 10 per cent higher than under the Conservatives&#146; 
            18-year rule as a whole, and calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to introduce immediately a wealth redistribution package involving 
            higher taxes for the wealthy and millionaires, combined with a living 
            minimum wage, significantly improved benefits and a basic state pension 
            of £150 a week without means testing.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-24</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Service 
            Tax</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the inherently unfair 
            nature of the Conservatives&#146; council tax and believes that its 
            ten-year existence has effected a wealth transfusion to the rich and 
            wealthy from pensioners and low-paid workers; believes that a fair 
            system to fund essential local government jobs and services must be 
            introduced urgently to shift the burden of payment for local services 
            from those least able to pay to those most able to pay, and therefore 
            resolves to introduce a personal income-based tax to pay for local 
            government jobs and services applied progressively and practically 
            across Scotland as a priority designed to improve the disposable income 
            of pensioners and ordinary workers while raising more revenue for 
            local services.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-23</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Nursery Nurses Regrading</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament supports the nursery nurses in their campaign for the 
            regrading of their annual pay from a current maximum possible annual 
            salary of £13,800 to £17,000 in recognition of the crucial expertise 
            and training required to provide pre-school children with education 
            and social skills; recognises that nursery nurses represent a low-paid 
            female workforce whose skills have been undervalued for far too long, 
            and calls on COSLA to agree to the nursery nurses&#146; justified 
            regrading claim which UNISON has been pursuing on behalf of nursery 
            nurses for almost two years.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-22</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Epilepsy Scotland 
            Free Helpline</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the launch 
            of the Epilepsy Scotland free helpline as the precursor to Epilepsy 
            Awareness Week from 18 to 24 May 2003; recognises the valuable role 
            that the helpline will provide in helping the 30,000 families living 
            with epilepsy and their carers to have better access to support and 
            information, and further recognises the important work of Epilepsy 
            Scotland in advocating on behalf of, and working with, Scottish families 
            affected by epilepsy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-21</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Cancellation of Iraq's 
            Debt</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that under Saddam Hussein&#146;s 
            regime Iraq accumulated almost $400 billion of debt and reparation 
            claims; welcomes the Jubilee Iraq organisation&#146;s call for cancellation 
            of these financial obligations so that the new democratic government 
            promised in Iraq, and the Iraqi people, are not made to pay the bill 
            for the wars and oppression they suffered under Saddam Hussein&#146;s 
            government; believes that the next government of Iraq should in reciprocation 
            cancel debts owed to Iraq by highly indebted poor countries, and encourages 
            the United Nations and the governments of the United States of America 
            and United Kingdom to use their influence with creditors and their 
            authority to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-20#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: 30th Anniversary 
            of Seafield Pit Disaster</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            10 May 2003 was the 30th Anniversary of the Seafield pit disaster; 
            acknowledges the efforts of the Fife Miners Cultural group in ensuring 
            that the anniversary was commemorated with the unveiling of a plaque 
            to the five miners who died; recognises the tireless work done by 
            the group in preserving and promoting Fife's mining heritage, and 
            congratulates the group on the creation of the Mining Heritage Centre 
            in Kinglassie.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-19#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Firefighters' Dispute</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that the firefighters' dispute remains unresolved; 
            supports the continued right to strike for an improvement in pay and 
            conditions; further notes the position of Her Majesty's Government 
            which allows for a pay settlement to be imposed by legislation; opposes 
            such an imposition and any proposal for legislation in the Scottish 
            Parliament intended to achieve that, and calls for meaningful talks 
            to be resumed as soon as possible ensuring a fair settlement for firefighters 
            with no detriment to the delivery of fire services to the general 
            public and for any change to future bargaining arrangements to be 
            the subject of consultation and negotiation with the Fire Brigades 
            Union, the STUC and other relevant parties.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-18</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes: M74 Northern Extension</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the proposed extension of the M74 motorway; 
            notes the potential economic benefits of completing Scotland&#146;s 
            "missing link", including the creation and safeguarding of thousands 
            of jobs; acknowledges that the construction of the M74 northern extension 
            will reduce traffic in urban areas such as Rutherglen Main Street 
            by up to 70%, and urges the Scottish Executive and the relevant local 
            authorities to ensure that this extension is completed as soon as 
            possible.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-16#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Inquiry into the Scottish 
            Agricultural College Proposals for Change</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            expresses grave concern regarding the proposals for change at the 
            Scottish Agricultural College; regrets that these proposals run contrary 
            to the policy of jobs dispersal and undermine widening access to further 
            and higher education, and considers that the matter should be referred 
            urgently to the appropriate committees of the Parliament so that an 
            inquiry may be held.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-15</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Dumfries and Galloway 
            Standard - Local Newspaper of the Year 2003</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament <a name="MotionText">recognises the importance of local 
            newspapers not only in providing information to their communities 
            but also in highlighting and campaigning on local concerns; notes 
            the many successful local campaigns run by the <em>Dumfries and Galloway 
            Standard</em>, including its current "Joining Forces" campaign with 
            Dumfries and Galloway Police, and congratulates the newspaper's editor, 
            news team and production staff on the recognition of their efforts 
            at the prestigious Scottish Newspaper of the Year Awards, organised 
            by <em>The Drum</em>, where the <em>Dumfries and Galloway Standard 
            </em>was named Local Newspaper of the Year.</a></p>
          <p><strong>S2M-13# A9</strong> (lodged on 12 May 2003) Mr Brian Monteith<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-13.1</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: A9</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-13) in the name of Murdo Fraser, <a name="AmendmentText">insert 
            at end &quot;further recognises that the A9 does not finish at Inverness; 
            welcomes the improvements committed for the A9 at the Ord of Caithness; 
            believes that important work needs to be done to upgrade the road 
            north of Inverness to an acceptable single carriageway standard, and 
            urges the Executive to conduct a safety analysis of the A9 from Perth 
            to Thurso in order to prioritise further improvements.&quot;</a></p>
