          <p><strong>*S2M-731</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Killing 
            of Afghan Children by US Forces</strong>-That the Parliament is appalled 
            at the killing of 15 Afghan children in the last 14 days by US forces 
            involved in &quot;clinical strikes&quot; against alleged Taliban members; 
            notes that these children were killed while playing near their homes 
            and that it represents an atrocity as reprehensible as any of those 
            atrocities executed by alleged terrorists across our world, and calls 
            on Her Majesty's Government to issue a firm statement of condemnation 
            for the continued killing of children in Afghanistan by US armed forces.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-730#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Algerian 
            Arrests</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the arrest of Ghalem 
            Belhadj, Salah Moullef, Hakim Ziem and Lasnan Lasnami, along with 
            five Algerians from England, on terrorism charges in December 2002; 
            notes that all charges have now been dropped against these men; believes 
            that this case further highlights the flaws in the Terrorism Act 2000 
            that currently allows sweeping powers of arrest and imprisonment, 
            often wrongly targeting individuals, particularly from the Muslim 
            community, and considers that much greater evidence should exist before 
            any future arrests of this nature are made.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-729</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Reform 
            of Personal Bankruptcy Proceedings</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the Opinion in the case of <em>Advocate General </em>v <em>Maureen 
            Taylor</em>, wherein the obtaining of a warrant to inhibit on the 
            dependence without judicial consideration contravenes Article 1, Protocol 
            1 of the European Convention on Human Rights; recognises that the 
            imposition of such measures to freeze an individual's assets is often 
            unnecessary and can cause hardship and suffering, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to include reform of this practice in its proposed 
            legislation on the reform of personal bankruptcy proceedings.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-728#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>General 
            Medical Services Contracts</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            that the provisions made for contracting-out out-of-hours care from 
            GPs to local NHS boards may be insufficiently funded to meet the unique 
            challenges encountered in rural practices; believes that rural practices 
            thus unable to opt out will have serious difficulty in recruiting 
            new doctors, and considers that the Scottish Executive should re-examine 
            the level of funding allocated to NHS boards providing these services 
            in rural areas.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-727</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Tax 
            Stamps on Spirits</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the Chancellor 
            of the Exchequer has stated that Her Majesty's Government is again 
            considering the introduction of tax stamps on spirits throughout the 
            United Kingdom; recognises that any such tax stamp would impact directly 
            on the Scotch whisky industry; believes that a tax stamp system would 
            be an ineffective means of combating fraud and illicit trade while 
            imposing substantial costs and practical problems on the industry, 
            particularly in relation to labelling and storage, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            against the introduction of tax stamps.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Johnstone, Mrs Nanette Milne, Phil Gallie, Murray 
            Tosh, Margaret Mitchell, Mr Ted Brocklebank, Fergus Ewing, Roseanna 
            Cunningham, Alex Fergusson, Mr David Davidson, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-727.1</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Tax 
            Stamps on Spirits</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-727) in 
            the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end 
            and insert &quot;welcomes the announcement by the Chancellor of the 
            Exchequer of the freeze on whisky duty for the remainder of the United 
            Kingdom parliamentary term; recognises the importance of the Scotch 
            whisky industry to the Scottish economy; notes that both the industry 
            and government are united in their desire to combat duty fraud; whilst 
            recognising that tax stamps are not considered to be the most effective 
            option by the industry, understands that Her Majesty's Government 
            is seeking a continued dialogue with the Scotch whisky industry to 
            arrive at a voluntary agreement that is both proportionate and sustainable 
            but, ultimately, which tackles the growing problem of duty fraud, 
            and encourages the Scotch Whisky Association to take the lead in bringing 
            this dialogue to a successful conclusion.&quot;</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-726</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Guantanamo 
            Bay</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 660 suspected terrorists, 
            including nine UK citizens, continue to be detained at the US Naval 
            Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; further notes that these prisoners, 
            who have been detained for almost two years, are being denied access 
            to US courts to test the legality of their continued detention, have 
            no access to civilian lawyers and that their only prospect of trial 
            will be by closed military tribunals in which military personnel will 
            act as interrogators, prosecutors, defence counsel, judges and, in 
            cases where the death penalty is imposed, executioners; welcomes the 
            fact that the US Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether lower 
            courts in the United States of America were right to conclude that 
            US courts lack jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality 
            of the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad in connection 
            with hostilities and incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay; is concerned, 
            however, that, in reaching a decision, the Supreme Court has access 
            to all relevant information including the evidence that many of the 
            individuals held at Guantanamo Bay were not arrested in connection 
            with hostilities; welcomes, in that regard, the involvement of lawyers 
            in the United States of America, England and Scotland in trying to 
            secure basic human rights for those held at Guantanamo Bay, and agrees 
            that this motion may be submitted as part of, and that those signing 
            give support to, a parliamentarians' amicus brief being prepared by 
            lawyers for submission to the US Supreme Court calling for all prisoners 
            to have access to an impartial court to determine their status and 
            test the legality of their continued detention.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-725#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Danger 
            Faced By Iraqi Trade Unionists</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            to hear of the appeal by the Iraqi Federation of Workers Trade Unions 
            (IFTU), which tells of a raid by dozens of US troops in 10 armoured 
            cars on the IFTU temporary headquarters in Baghdad on Saturday 6 December 
            2003, where windows were smashed, documents seized, posters and banners 
            condemning terrorism torn down, eight IFTU leaders arrested but subsequently 
            released and no reason or explanation given for the raid, and supports 
            the call of the IFTU for President Bush to conduct a full investigation 
            into the raid and to ensure that it will not be repeated and for the 
            United States of America to respect the right of workers under international 
            law to form free and independent trade unions.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-724</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>Supreme 
            Court</strong>-That the Parliament calls upon Her Majesty's Government, 
            in the event of a United Kingdom Supreme Court being created, to ensure 
            both that Scottish judges are appointed to sit in all civil appeals 
            from Scotland and that decisions of the Supreme Court in non-Scottish 
            cases are not binding in Scots law except in so far as the law determining 
            such cases is applicable on a United Kingdom basis.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Fergusson, Murdo Fraser, Phil Gallie, Robert Brown, 
            Mr Ted Brocklebank, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, 
            David McLetchie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-723</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Banks, 
            Credit Companies and Loan Sharks</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the recently announced measures designed to (a) control the unseemly 
            practices of banks and other agencies that encourage people to take 
            on financial burdens that they can ill afford and (b) pursue the loan 
            sharks, who batten upon poor people, whom the banks ignore, and inflict 
            upon them scandalously high levels of interest; believes that there 
            is no place for such activities in Scotland in the 21st century, and 
            supports the Scottish Executive, Her Majesty's Government and local 
            authorities who are introducing measures that will drive these loan 
            sharks from the streets whilst at the same time encouraging those 
            in debt to approach the appropriate agencies for help in dealing with 
            this serious problem.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-722</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>The 
            Commonwealth and Zimbabwe</strong>-That the Parliament commends those 
            Commonwealth leaders who stood firmly against the lifting of the suspension 
            of Zimbabwe from the organisation; is of the view that that stance 
            will hearten Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition and currently 
            on trial in that country, and will also send a message of hope to 
            Mr Tsvangirai's colleagues, trade unionists, journalists and others 
            who have been brave enough to oppose President Mugabe's oppressive 
            regime, but believes, at the same time, that more affluent Commonwealth 
            nations have to do much, much more in order to help eradicate the 
            grinding poverty that blights the lives of so many Commonwealth citizens 
            and, if there is a failure of political will in this regard, then 
            those suffering people will inevitably question the value, or the 
            point, of membership of the organisation.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-721</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Smoking 
            Ban in Shopping Centre Concourse</strong>-That the Parliament applauds 
            the decision by the Avenue Shopping Centre in Newton Mearns to ban 
            smoking from the common areas of the centre; appreciates the rights 
            of units within the centre to make their own decision, but points 
            out that this decision is based on public demand, and encourages other 
            shopping centres and the units within the Avenue Shopping Centre to 
            follow the example set.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-719</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>VIP 
            Radio</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of VIP 
            Radio, the first radio station aimed at breaking down social isolation 
            faced by people with sight problems, which in the first instance will 
            help 10,000 people with sight problems in the Greater Glasgow area; 
            congratulates the station on employing a mix of sighted, blind and 
            partially sighted people; welcomes the potential for this radio station, 
            although initially broadcasting via an internet channel, to extend 
            the service, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to support 
            all public service organisations to ensure that their services and 
            information are fully accessible to people with sight problems and 
            other disabilities.</P>

            <em>Stage 2 of the 2004-05 Budget Process </em>(SP Paper 62).</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-714</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Australian 
            Government's Treatment of Refugees</strong>-That the Parliament condemns 
            the actions of the Australian government in refusing to grant sanctuary 
            to refugees arriving there and in jeopardising the lives of such refugees 
            by preventing them from reaching Australia, forcibly removing them, 
            detaining them in prisons for indefinite periods of time and failing 
            to grant residence when their refugee status has been recognised.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-713#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Sustainability 
            in Higher Education</strong>-That the Parliament, on the occasion 
            of the conference on sense and sustainability in Scottish higher education, 
            organised by the Higher Education Partnership for Sustainability in 
            Scotland (HEPS), commends the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council 
            (SHEFC) on its promotion of sustainable development in the sector, 
            including its support for HEPS, led by University of Aberdeen, Heriot 
            Watt University, University of St. Andrews and University of Stirling 
            and their support for the Scottish Universities' Network for Sustainability

            of Music and Drama, University of St Andrews, University of Stirling, 
            University of Strathclyde; also commends the UHI Millennium Institute 
            and Forum for the Future for their contribution; further commends 
            these organisations and universities for their pro-active agenda and 
            the progress they have made so far in mainstreaming sustainability 
            good practice into the management, research, and curriculum of the 
            higher education sector; recognises the importance of these developments 
            for the economy, environment, and future of Scotland, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should request SHEFC, the Scottish Further 
            Education Funding Council and Scottish Enterprise to require sustainability 
            reporting and monitoring as a condition for funding and grant aid.</P>

            to end and insert &quot;courageous, worthy of support and fully in 
            keeping with the pride in their Scottish identity that new Scots feel 
            and notes that more and more Scots consider themselves to be Scottish 
            rather than British and that British identity is becoming increasingly 
            artificial as the recent English rugby victory celebrations, with 
            not a Union flag in sight, demonstrated.&quot;</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-647#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Access 
            to Children's Therapy Services in North East Scotland</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with great concern the problems facing children 
            with special needs in Aberdeenshire and elsewhere with regard to accessing 
            vital physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy 
            and orthotics; further notes the difficulties of recruiting speech 
            and language therapists in the north east of Scotland and that the 
            speech and language therapy training courses are located in the central 
            belt and are oversubscribed; further notes that those staff currently 
            in place do a tremendous job given the strain that they are being 
            placed under, and considers that the Scottish Executive should (a) 
            make greater funding available for these courses, (b) promote the 
            location of a speech and language therapy training course in the north 
            east, (c) provide funding for training and employment of additional 
            orthotic staff and technicians in the north east and (d) provide additional 
            funding to NHS Grampian and Aberdeenshire Council to allow short-term 
            solutions to be quickly implemented to improve the immediate situation.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-365#</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh's 
            Proposals for Congestion Charging</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that the draft congestion charging scheme approved by the City of 
            Edinburgh Council proposes to exempt Edinburgh residents who live 
            outwith the proposed outer cordon from paying a congestion charge, 
            whilst still proposing to levy a charge on residents of other local 
            authorities; believes that such a proposal is discriminatory and unfair, 
            thus failing to meet the requirement of &quot;fair treatment&quot; 
            emphasised by the Scottish Executive in giving approval in principle 
            to a charging scheme, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should reject any subsequent proposal from the City of Edinburgh Council 
            which is based on this form of charging regime.</P>
