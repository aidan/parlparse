<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1483</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Suicide</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with cautious optimism the decline in the rate of suicide, with the 2006 rates being 17.4 per 100,000 population for men and 5.3 per 100,000 population for women, the lowest over the period from 1991 to 2006; is nevertheless alarmed that Scotland still has the highest suicide rate in the United Kingdom, with 765 deaths due to confirmed or suspected suicide in 2006, an average of more than two each day; is aware that about three-quarters of suicides were of males, with one in four deaths among men under age 35 being as a result of taking their own lives and suicide continuing to be the leading cause of death for that demographic; notes that the risk of suicide in the most deprived areas of Scotland is nearly double the national average and that approximately 75% of suicides were completed by individuals who were not in contact with a health professional within the previous year; recognises the importance of providing help for these people and others affected by suicides and suicidal behaviour; lauds the work of Samaritans, Childline, Breathing Space - the suicide helpline for men aged 16 to 40, and Choose Life <em>-</em> the 10-year programme launched by the previous administration in 2002 aimed at preventing suicide and raising awareness of the issue; recognises the importance of immediate, accessible help for individuals who suffer from suicidal thoughts; acknowledges however that phone number hotlines are not widely known, and therefore seeks to increase public awareness of such programmes by developing a national suicide prevention helpline accessible via 999 to make it easily accessible in times of need.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1482</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Prison Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports stronger alternatives to prison when dealing with crime; furthermore notes the Pew Center on the States report which calls the USA the global leader in the rate at which it imprisons its citizenry, with more than one in 100 adults behind bars in that country, and in addition applauds the stance taken by the states of Texas and Kansas to slow their prison population growth, as more cash-strapped federal states are faced with soaring costs and thus recognise that prison does not impact on recidivism or overall crime rates according to the Pew Center research.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1481</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Tax Havens and Relative Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the recent call by Germany for an EU-wide debate on tax havens; notes that the super-rich use European tax havens, such as the Channel Islands, to avoid paying billions of Euros to members of the European Union; holds that tax avoidance and evasion is inimical to tackling relative poverty and that, in developed countries, relative poverty is at least as detrimental to health, happiness and longevity as is absolute poverty; notes that the funds released by eliminating tax avoidance and evasion could significantly reduce relative poverty and that relative poverty and child poverty, as noted by motion S3M-1474, is a major problem in Scotland; considers, however, that the abuse of tax havens is global; therefore welcomes Barack Obama&rsquo;s proposed Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, and calls on governments worldwide to examine their relationships with businesses that expatriate profits through the use of tax havens.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1480</strong> <strong>Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Damian&rsquo;s Law</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled that innocent individuals continue to be murdered in random unprovoked knife attacks in Scotland; shares the anger of the communities of Greenock and elsewhere that a number of these offences are committed by offenders with previous convictions for knife crime; regrets that, despite law reform and concerted efforts by the Scottish Executive, police and others, too many individuals still carry a weapon as a matter of course; agrees that knife-carriers need to be taught that their actions have consequences before they rob someone of their life, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to examine the imposition of mandatory custodial sentences for unlawful possession of knives and other bladed weapons as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1479</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Milton of Campsie Athlete to Carry Olympic Torch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kirsty McWilliam of Milton of Campsie who has been given the honour of taking part in a prestigious Olympic ceremony; notes that Kirsty will be participating in the Olympic Torch Relay, which spans 22 cities and five continents, ahead of the Olympic Games in Beijing in August 2008; recognises that 17-year-old Kirsty is the under-19 British Triathlon Champion and won a bronze medal at last summer&rsquo;s European championships, and notes that she is currently ranked third in Europe and seventh in the world.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1478</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Venezuelan Oil Assets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision on 7 February 2008 by a court in England to grant an injunction to US multinational oil company ExxonMobil, freezing the US $12 billion assets held by the Venezuelan oil company PDVSA in England and Wales; further notes that the action was in response to the policy of the Venezuelan Government to take back majority control of its own oil resources, that the Venezuelan Government was given no notice of the case and was not afforded any opportunity to be represented at the hearing; believes that the action by ExxonMobil contravenes the right of the democratically elected government of Venezuela to exercise sovereignty over its natural resources, a right that properly belongs to all countries of the world; supports Venezuela&rsquo;s national sovereignty, including the right to determine its own policy in relation to its oil and natural resources, and calls on government at all levels in the United Kingdom to support efforts to have the dispute resolved by the World Bank&rsquo;s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1477</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Islamic Relief Support for Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Islamic Relief UK on raising &pound;100,000 at a dinner in Glasgow Central Mosque to be sent as much-needed aid to assist the Palestinian people in Gaza; recognises  the work of Islamic Relief which annually raises and spends &pound;8 million on humanitarian assistance in the occupied territories, and commends the organisers of this latest Glasgow event, along with the Scottish people and business, for the generosity shown in an hour of such need in Palestine.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1476</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Rail Services in Airdrie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Jamie Hepburn MSP&rsquo;s call for rail improvements in Central Scotland, including a better rail service for Airdrie; notes that the Airdrie to Bathgate rail link was agreed by the previous administration and included the provision of a railway station at Plains; condemns the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision not to proceed with a station at Plains, despite the massive difference that it would make to the local community and local economy, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider this matter urgently to ensure that the people of Plains in Airdrie have a direct link to the new Airdrie to Bathgate rail link.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1475</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with Shelter Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the excellent record of the housing campaign organisation, Shelter, over its 41-year history in campaigning to highlight the issues of homelessness in Scotland and the United Kingdom; expresses its regret at the actions of Shelter&rsquo;s management in seeking to impose cuts in pay, longer working hours and the undermining of conditions of employment on Shelter&rsquo;s dedicated staff; expresses its solidarity with Shelter&rsquo;s members of Unite the Union which are currently in dispute, and urges the board of directors to work co-operatively with the union to resolve this dispute amicably to enable Shelter to continue to play its invaluable role in our society.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1474</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Affairs Committee: Report on Child Poverty in Scotland (HC 277)</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent report on child poverty in Scotland by Westminster&rsquo;s Scottish Affairs Committee which shows that Scotland is doing better than the United Kingdom as a whole at reducing child poverty; notes, however, that the rate of reduction in child poverty may be slowing and that recent reductions in child poverty rates may not have fully benefited children in the most severe poverty; notes the recommendation that the position of young single adults should be improved and, accordingly, that age-based discrimination in the tax and benefits system should end; notes that a significant proportion of children living in poverty come from households where at least one parent is working and the committee&rsquo;s consequent recommendation that the problems of low pay, job retention and career advancement be tackled; further notes the committee&rsquo;s emphasis on the importance of suitable and affordable childcare, especially with respect to disabled children, as well as its emphasis on the importance of the contribution to society made by full-time carers; also notes its criticism of the complexity of the tax credit system; supports its call for the UK and Scottish governments (where relevant) to do more to simplify the benefits system, to improve awareness of entitlements and to constantly review the effectiveness of programmes designed to tackle child poverty, and, especially, calls for poverty-reduction programmes to be focussed mainly on those in the deepest poverty and on families with disabled members.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1470</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to President-elect of NUS Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Gurjit Singh on his election as President of the National Union of Students Scotland; notes the contribution of the NUS and other student bodies to the successful campaign for abolition of the graduate endowment; believes that the NUS has an important role to play as a strong, independent voice for students in Scotland, and further believes that MSPs of all parties should continue to work closely with student representative bodies to ensure that the voice of students is heard in the Parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1470.1</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to President-elect of NUS Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1470) in the name of Aileen Campbell, insert at end &quot;and welcomes the dramatic conversion of the SNP in supporting the work and existence of NUS Scotland as part of a successful UK-wide student union, following decades of campaigning by student nationalists to withdraw their institutions from its membership.&quot;</p>
