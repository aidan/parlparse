          <p><strong>*S1M-3170#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Psychiatric Services 
            at Murray Royal Hospital, Perth</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the concerns of psychiatrists, user groups and members of the legal 
            profession at the reduction in secure beds in psychiatric hospitals 
            in the Tayside area; considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            ensure that forensic psychiatric services currently provided at Murray 
            Royal Hospital are not lost during the restructuring of services by 
            NHS Tayside but rather that an increased number of beds and appropriate 
            services is made available for male and female patients in the forensic 
            psychiatric unit, and believes that the importance of mental health 
            facilities across Tayside must be recognised and adequately funded.

          <p>Supported by: David Mundell<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3169</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: The Parliament thanks 
            Aberdeen</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its thanks to the 
            University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen City Council and all Aberdonians 
            for the welcome and the hospitality that we received in the Granite 
            City during our historic sitting in Europe's oil capital; considers 
            that, in the words of the city's famous toast, we were &quot;Happy 
            to meet, sorry to part and happy to meet again, Bon Accord!&quot;, 
            and calls on the Parliamentary Bureau to give consideration to the 
            Parliament meeting outwith Edinburgh periodically, including returning 
            to Aberdeen. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3168#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Glasgow Airport</strong>-That 
            the Parliament supports the development of Glasgow Airport as the 
            main centre of scheduled aviation services, by means of as many direct, 
            non-stop flights as possible, between the west of Scotland and the 
            rest of the world; applauds Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority's 
            decision to commit £500,000 to finalising preparation for the construction 
            of a heavy rail link between Glasgow Central Station and the airport; 
            recognises that this new rail link should be routed via Paisley Gilmour 
            Street and Paisley St James; believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should commit itself politically and financially to this new rail 
            link immediately; further recognises that any measures to enhance 
            the capacity of Edinburgh Airport could pose a threat to the future 
            of Glasgow Airport and, consequently, to the west of Scotland's economy; 
            invites the Office of Fair Trading to consider whether the interests 
            of the travelling public are best served by the retention in ownership 
            of both Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports by Scottish Airports Ltd, a 
            subsidiary of British Airports Authority, and further invites the 
            First Minister, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary 
            of State for Trade and Industry, the Office of Fair Trading and all 
            Glasgow MSPs and MPs to take note of the terms of this motion.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3167#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Congratulations to 
            The Robert Gordon University for Scrapping Archaic Academic Contracts</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates The Robert Gordon University and the 
            Association of University Teachers for reaching an agreement that 
            will see academics currently classed as contract research staff put 
            on open-ended permanent contracts and hopes that other universities 
            will follow Robert Gordon's example; recognises that around 4,700 
            academics in Scotland, Scotland's brightest and best, are still stuck 
            on fixed-term contracts and are faced with insecurity, poor promotion 
            prospects and low pay, and considers that the Minister for Enterprise, 
            Transport and Lifelong Learning should use the example set by The 
            Robert Gordon University as an opportunity to give the higher education 
            sector clear guidance and leadership on this issue.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3161</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan: Gaelic Services 
            in the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the resignation 
            of the Gaelic Officer; commends him for the excellent work he has 
            done in the service of Gaelic in the Parliament since his appointment 
            in September 2000, and asks the Presiding Officer to ensure that Gaelic 
            services in the Parliament are supported and developed and that the 
            Gaelic Officer is properly resourced.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3159</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Appointment of 
            the Lord High Commissioner</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            the Catholic Relief Act of 1829 continues to prohibit the appointment 
            of a Catholic as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of 
            the Church of Scotland; further notes that virtually all other provisions 
            of this outmoded and discriminatory act have been repealed and that, 
            whilst the position of Lord High Commissioner is a non-ecclesiastical 
            appointment by Her Majesty the Queen with no liturgical or religious 
            function in the Church of Scotland, it has great significance and 
            prominence in Scotland at the time of the Kirk's General Assembly; 
            observes that the Church and Nation Committee of the Church of Scotland 
            is taking a commendable stance on issues of sectarianism and the need 
            to root them out from Scottish society, and suggests that the Church 
            of Scotland join with the Scottish Parliament in encouraging Her Majesty's 
            Government to repeal this provision in the Catholic Relief Act and 
            in exhorting Her Majesty the Queen to appoint a Catholic to the position 
            of Lord High Commissioner for 2003 as a mark of reconciliation and 
            as a sign of national determination to have done with institutionalised 
            discrimination.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3158</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Smoking in Public 
            Places</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the 
            public places charter on smoking voluntary code of practice; notes 
            its tolerant attitude to smoking in public places, its advocacy of 
            tolerance of non-smokers rights by smokers and vice versa, and, in 
            recognition of this adult and liberal approach, calls for the charter 
            to be employed in the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood, 
            for a suitably sized room with air cleaning equipment to be located 
            at Holyrood for the benefit of smokers and non-smokers alike and for 
            similar consideration to be given to the Parliamentary Bar. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3157</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Central Scotland 
            Police Headquarters</strong>-That the Parliament notes with dismay 
            that the SNP members of Central Scotland Police joint board have instigated 
            a report which will examine the feasibility of relocating the force's 
            headquarters from Randolphfield, Stirling, to a new site in Falkirk; 
            believes that this proposal is being put forward for partisan and 
            parochial reasons and without regard to the impact on either headquarters 
            staff or police finances, and further believes that the proposal is 
            an unnecessary distraction from the greater priorities that the police 
            have to deal with, particularly the growth in crime which, according 
            to the Scottish Executive's own statistics, has risen by 25% in Clackmannanshire, 
            9% in Stirling, and 3% in Falkirk since 1997.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3157.1</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Central Scotland 
            Police Headquarters</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3157) 
            in the name of Mr Brian Monteith, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out 
            from &quot;, particularly&quot; to end and insert &quot;; recognises 
            that the priority of the Physical Resources Sub-Committee of the joint 
            board should be to ensure that the police buildings across the central 
            Scotland area are of an appropriate standard, allowing officers to 
            be even more effective in their work, and congratulates Central Scotland 
            Police on their efforts towards the success of the Safer Central initiative, 
            which has taken drugs to the value of over £260,000 off the streets 
            of central Scotland and has led to a detection rate of 64%, one of 
            the highest in the United Kingdom.&quot;</a></p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3152#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Westfield Landfill/Recycling 
            Plant</strong>-That the Parliament notes that since 1975 there have 
            been a number of EC Waste Directives demanding action on waste management 
            and that consecutive governments have failed to make significant improvements 
            particularly with regard to recycling; further notes that Scotland 
            currently has the worst recycling record in Europe with only 4.5% 
            of waste recycled compared to other small European countries, like 
            Switzerland, who have reached 50%; recognises that Scotland sends 
            £50 million per annum to Her Majesty's Treasury in landfill tax; believes 
            that revenue raised from landfill tax should go direct to the Scottish 
            Executive budget to support and develop the introduction of separation 
            at source recycling, waste minimisation and packaging reduction: further 
            believes that mandatory targets must be set for local authorities 
            to achieve 30% to 35% recycling rates for domestic waste by 2010; 
            is concerned that large landfill/recycling plants, such as that proposed 
            for Westfield in Fife, which will draw in waste from all over Scotland, 
            fail to meet the test of proximity, where waste should be dealt with 
            as close to its source as can be achieved, and regrets that, if the 
            Westfield proposals are agreed to, then the scale of proposals will 
            have an adverse impact on the quality of life in the local communities 
            that surround the site, on the health of children and adults resident 
            in the area and will put additional and excessive pressure on the 
            already under-funded roads and bridges infrastructure across Fife.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Andrew Welsh, Tommy Sheridan</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3151#</strong> <strong>Gordon Jackson: Epilepsy</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes with concern the 25% rate 
            of misdiagnosis of epilepsy, as identified in <em>The Misdiagnosis 
            of Epilepsy: Findings of a population study</em> (Scheepers, Clough 
            and Pickles) and <em>The Misdiagnosis of Epilepsy</em> (Smith, Defalla 
            and Chadwick); recognises and agrees that there is a need for a national 
            framework for epilepsy, as already exists for diabetes, to improve 
            standards of health care, and further notes that England and Wales 
            are working towards such a framework for 2005.</a></p>
