<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1936</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Challenging the European Investment Bank</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication, with the financial assistance of the European Union, of the <em>Citizens&rsquo; Guide to the European Investment Bank</em> (EIB) by the coalition of development and environmental NGOs known as Counter Balance: Challenging the European Investment Bank; sympathises with the organisation&rsquo;s desire that the EIB becomes a public interest-driven bank and a tool for achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals, that it should play a major role in the fight against climate change and that it should operate as a truly accountable institution and lend in a responsible manner rather than give public subsidies for private companies; concurs with the aim of increasing awareness among various civil groups of the environmental, social and human rights impacts of the EIB&rsquo;s operations outwith the European Union, and believes that the EIB&rsquo;s destructive activities to date, based on an outdated and counterproductive development model, would justify the name &quot;Extractive Industries Bank&quot; as referred to in the document.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1935</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 26 countries have already ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and believes that the UK Government should ratify the convention at the earliest possible opportunity to signal that disabled citizens of the United Kingdom enjoy the same human rights afforded in all decent societies.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1934</strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>CLIC Sargent Food and Nutrition for Children and Young People with Cancer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that children and young people with cancer are not always offered food in hospital that is appetising and responsive to their needs; considers food and nutrition to be vital to these children and young people who need to keep up their immunity from infection, whose taste buds will change as a result of chemotherapy, and who are likely to be in hospital for some time; notes with concern that a survey of families by children&rsquo;s cancer charity, CLIC Sargent, shows that 92% of families surveyed in Scotland have seen their food spending increase while their children were undergoing cancer treatment, and that all parents reported bringing food into the ward for their children; is concerned that food is being wasted in hospital due to its unappetising nature, and calls on the Scottish Government, through its Choosing the Right Ingredients discussion, to ensure that all children with cancer in Scotland are served good quality, appropriate food in hospital.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1933</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Scrap the Fuel Duty Rise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the calls by both the Federation of Small Businesses and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to cancel the proposed 2p rise in fuel duty, due to be introduced in autumn 2008; notes figures from the Scottish Chambers of Commerce that indicate that the UK Government has received an additional &pound;505 million of revenue due to rising fuel prices over the last six weeks; notes that, according to the Federation of Small Businesses, deferring the 2p rise by six months would cost &pound;550 million, and therefore calls on the Chancellor, in light of this dramatic increase in revenues, to scrap the proposed rise in fuel duty and to introduce a fuel price regulator.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1932</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Parliament Project Team, based in the School of History at the University of St Andrews, in producing an online database, The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, containing the proceedings of the Scottish Parliament from 1235 to 1707, including such entries as that of the 1318 King Robert Parliament &quot;Concerning holding and observing common law and justice: The lord king wishes and commands that common law and common justice should be done as much to paupers as to wealthy people according to the ancient laws and liberties used rightly before these times&quot;.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1895.2</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Removing the Barriers to Microgeneration</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1895) in the name of Shirley-Anne Somerville, insert at end &quot;considers that householders also need suitable methods of financing their investment in microrenewables and that in addition to grant-based investment there is also scope for government to support the development of new financial products which would allow homeowners to use the equity in their property to install microrenewable technology without upfront costs or regular loan repayments, the sum being repaid only when the property is sold; recognises the work being done by Kirklees Council in the north of England to develop the RE-Charge scheme which works in this way, and considers that the Scottish Government should learn from such innovative approaches and follow this example.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1888#</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Increasing Access to Insulin Pumps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the considerable benefits that insulin pumps have for diabetics to help them to manage their condition; notes with concern the current restrictive criteria for eligibility for the use of insulin pumps which have contributed to insulin pump usage in Scotland being among the lowest in western Europe, with only around 0.75% of people with Type 1 diabetes using pumps in Scotland, compared with 15% to 20% in the United States of America and Germany; is concerned at the extreme regional disparity in uptake of insulin pumps across NHS boards, with only two patients receiving insulin pump therapy in NHS Ayrshire and Arran, compared with 42 in NHS Tayside in the most recent figures, despite all NHS boards having received funding for access to insulin pumps; supports the campaign of Diabetes UK to increase access to insulin pumps and welcomes the review being undertaken currently by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the eligibility for use of pumps in the NHS, and believes that further steps should be taken to ensure that new NICE guidance that seeks to relax access criteria is adopted swiftly in Scotland, to support all NHS boards to increase access to insulin pumps for patients with diabetes and to enable more training for health practitioners to support patients in moving to the use of pumps where it is clearly of benefit in the management of their diabetes.</p>
