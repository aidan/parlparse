<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3300</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Glenburn Post Office, Paisley</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concern in Glenburn, Paisley, following the closure of the local post office; notes that the community, particularly elderly and disabled people, will be inconvenienced by having to travel a considerable distance to find an alternative, and calls for a local post office to be re-established in Glenburn as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3299</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Budget (Scotland) (No.2) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Budget (Scotland) (No.2) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alex Salmond<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3298</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Katie Dorman</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Katie Dorman, age 10, a pupil of St Aidan&rsquo;s Primary School in Wishaw, on securing a role alongside the star-studded Scottish cast of No Holds Bard, which will be shown on BBC1 as part of the Homecoming celebrations; notes that talented Katie, who attends the UK Theatre Group in Glasgow, plays the part of Hailey Braid, the daughter of the character played by Extras and Ugly Betty star Ashley Jensen, and further notes that this programme gives P6 pupil Katie the opportunity to showcase her talents as she sings and recites poetry in her role, which was filmed last summer at various locations in Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3297</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Banknotes (Acceptability in the United kingdom) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that David Mundell MP is to introduce a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill in the UK Parliament to make provision for the acceptability of Scottish banknotes throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Lamont<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Ted Brocklebank<strong>*</strong>, Jackson Carlaw<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, Elizabeth Smith<strong>*</strong>, Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Mitchell<strong>*</strong>, John Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3296</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Slashing Services in West Dunbartonshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses dismay at the recent budget savings options issued by West Dunbartonshire Council, totalling a possible &pound;8.5 million of cuts in services; notes that the proposed cuts disproportionately affect children and young people and older and vulnerable people; further notes that for older people the proposals include increasing the cost of community alarms, charging for meals on wheels and closing day care centres and care homes, that for people with a learning disability or mental health problem who are receiving a housing support service the council is considering charging &pound;20 a week for services that are currently free and that for children and young people the proposals include options such as closing Garshake Nursery and St Martin&rsquo;s Primary School, the removal of all breakfast clubs and free milk for children in primary one to primary three, the closure of all out-of-school care provision and the removal of all music, PE, drama and art teachers from primary schools, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government urgently to intervene to protect the interests of West Dunbartonshire residents.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3295</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Support Renfrewshire Faitrade Zone Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign to gain Fairtrade zone status for Renfrewshire, following its application, and notes that Renfrewshire&rsquo;s campaign won the Fairtrade Foundations Outstanding Achievement Award at the 2008 Fairtrade Fortnight Awards.</p>
