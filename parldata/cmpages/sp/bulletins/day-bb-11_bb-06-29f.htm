<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00441 Kevin Stewart: Congratulations to Bangla Mela Organisers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the Aberdeen Bangla Mela celebration and recognises that, although the rain fell on Westburn Park, the day was bright and colourful thanks to the hospitality given to everyone by the city&rsquo;s Bangladeshi community.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00440 Neil Findlay: The Right to Withdraw Labour and the Current Industrial Action over Pensions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the right of workers to withdraw their labour is a human right recognised in the UN&rsquo;s International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; considers that any proposals to put a legal limit of 50% turnout in order to allow public sector workers to take industrial action is a precedent that governments should be wary of, especially considering the low turnouts in recent parliamentary and local government elections; supports the aspirations of teachers in England and Wales and civil servants in Scotland and across the United Kingdom to protect their pensions and jobs; queries the right of the UK Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, to question the morality of teachers on this issue when he is part of the government asking valued public sector workers to pay more, work longer and get less from their pensions, and considers that the proposal to change healthy public pension schemes is no more than a further tax on public sector workers.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00439 David Torrance: Kirkcaldy YMCA 125th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff and volunteers of Kirkcaldy YMCA, founded in 1886, on this year celebrating its 125th anniversary; considers that it has a proud history in hosting and supporting local sports and providing a prominent venue and performance space for musical bands and initiatives over the past 60 years; commends the organisation on what it considers to be its excellent work in delivering opportunities for young men and women through diverse and exciting educational, recreational and caring programmes to assist the physical, social, mental and spiritual development of young people and their contribution to the community, and wishes Kirkcaldy YMCA every success for its next 125 years of service to the people of Kirkcaldy.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00438 Drew Smith: Opposing Unfair Attacks on Public Sector Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament puts on record its recognition of the hard and dedicated work of public sector workers; recognises the anger felt by many at what it sees as the serious attack on their living standards arising from measures being taken by the UK Government, resulting in reduced terms and conditions of employment and pension provision as a direct result of the UK Government&rsquo;s economic strategy, and urges the UK Government to enter into meaningful and genuine consultations with the parties involved in the dispute to avoid the necessity of industrial action being taken.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00437 Jean Urquhart: Ullapool High School, Young Engineers Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ullapool High School on winning the Showcase Award at the Young Engineers event held recently by the Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI); notes that, led by their teacher, Topher Dawson, the Ullapool High School S5 pupils, Robby MacKay, Seoras MacLeod, Jordan MacDonald, Alexander Stuart and James MacLeod, demonstrated an eight-metre-long airship that they built over the winter, flying it both inside and outside the Glasgow Science Centre; notes that the event was attended by 60 schools from across Scotland and understands that the airship was one of the most admired projects of the day; agrees with Dr Lesley Sawers, SCDI chief executive, that young engineers and scientists are among the country&rsquo;s most valuable assets, that securing children&rsquo;s interest in these areas from an early age is vital to Scotland&rsquo;s economic future, cementing its status as a leader in areas such as oil and gas and low-carbon energy, and considers that young engineers and science clubs work towards these goals, teaching children practical skills in fun, hands-on ways.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00436 Aileen McLeod: Savour the Flavours Wins Stall Wars</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dumfries and Galloway-based Savour the Flavours for winning the Stall Wars competition at the Royal Highland Show 2011; notes that Savour the Flavours works to support Dumfries and Galloway&rsquo;s food and drink industry, working with producers, chefs, retailers, manufacturers, event organisers, schools and consumers to help raise awareness of the exceptional local produce to be found in Dumfries and Galloway; further notes that Savour the Flavours operates with funding from Dumfries and Galloway Council, the LEADER programme and the Scottish Government; further congratulates Liz Ramsay, Dave Smith and their team for recently receiving further funding to help continue to create a strong food and drink industry in Dumfries and Galloway; understands that there are a massive 75 events confirmed thus far for Flavour Fortnight 2011 in Dumfries and Galloway, far exceeding the previous record of 47 events in 2010; wishes the Dumfries and Galloway team the best of success for Flavour Fortnight 2011, which runs between 3 and 18 September, and hopes that the Savour the Flavours approach is used as a template for success across Scotland to support the fantastic Scottish food and drink industry.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00435 Jim Eadie: Inch Summer Saturday</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers and participants involved in the Inch Summer Saturday, a day of arts, crafts, sports, live music and dancing held at the Inch park in Edinburgh on 25 June 2011 and funded by a &pound;1,000 Comic Relief grant aimed at bringing the community together and celebrating the creative talents of local people in the Inch, Liberton and Gilmerton areas; notes that the event was made possible thanks to the support of 12 partner community organisations and that the funding was administered through Arts South Edinburgh, and considers the event to be an excellent example of a grassroots community event with activities for people of all ages.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00434 Tavish Scott: The Hello Campaign for the National Year of Communication</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Hello Campaign for the National Year of Communication; notes that the campaign, run by the Communication Trust, a coalition of over 35 leading voluntary sector organisations, aims to increase understanding of how important it is for children and young people to develop good communication skills; further notes that, in the 21st century, the ability to communicate, to say what you want to say and understand what other people are saying, is fundamental; understands with concern that in the United Kingdom, over one million children and young people have some form of speech, language or communication need that can affect them severely; further understands that, in areas of poverty, over 50% of children start school with delayed language skills; congratulates the campaign&rsquo;s ambition to help thousands of children and young people to improve their communication skills so that they can live life to the full, and urges the Scottish Government to ensure that the needs of children with speech, language and communication needs are addressed.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00433 Graeme Pearson: Donald Dewar Debating Tournament 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all of the participants in the Donald Dewar Debating Tournament final 2011; considers that the teams from Braes High School in Falkirk, Glenalmond College in Perth, Kirkcudbright Academy in Kirkcudbright and Stewart&rsquo;s Melville College in Edinburgh were a credit to their schools, families and communities; recognises the achievement of Mari McGinlay and Blair Wilson from Braes High School, Ruairidh Macintosh and Andrew Niven from Stewart Melville&rsquo;s College, Simon Boendermaker and Marcus Buist from Glenalmond College and Helen Smith and Max Syed-Tollan from Kirkcudbright Academy in making the final, and applauds them all for the high calibre of debating, which, it considers, would no doubt have made the man whom the tournament is named after very proud.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00419 Gil Paterson: Big Lottery Fund&rsquo;s 2014 Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Big Lottery Fund that three projects in Clydebank and Milngavie will be allocated resources totalling &pound;4,729 to help support and stimulate grassroots involvement in sport and physical activity; notes that the three successful projects are Milngavie Primary School Parent Teacher Association, Radnor Park Out of School Care and Clydebank College; congratulates all the projects on their successful applications, and wishes them the best of luck for the future.</p>
