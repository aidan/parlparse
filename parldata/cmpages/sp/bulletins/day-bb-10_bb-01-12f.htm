                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5495 Jim Tolson: Third Annual Fife Jazz Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the third annual Fife Jazz Festival on 4 to 7 February 2010, celebrating both jazz and Fife with music from internationally acclaimed musicians as well as Fife jazz musicians at venues across the Kingdom, including Dunfermline, St Andrews, Cowdenbeath, Buckhaven, Glenrothes and Freuchie; further welcomes the Fife Jazz Education programme in schools and Fife Jazz Weekend School, encouraging young people to play jazz; notes that the festival will host the Arctic Youth Jazz Orchestra, which will perform with the Fife Youth Jazz Orchestra, and acknowledges the positive effect that this festival will have on the cultural wellbeing of people across Fife and visitors to the area.</p>
