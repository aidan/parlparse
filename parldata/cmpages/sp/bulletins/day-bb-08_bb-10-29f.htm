<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2783</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Mental Health (England and Wales Cross-border transfer: patients subject to requirements other than detention) (Scotland) Regulations 2008 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>2.55 pm</strong>&#9;Scottish Government Debate: Non-Native Invasive Species</p>
<p>and insert</p>
<p><strong>2.55 pm</strong>&#9;Ministerial Statement: Teacher Employment Working Group Report</p>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Government Debate: Non-Native Invasive Species</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2780</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>A Helping Hand with the Rising Cost of Living</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the rise in the cost of living and the impact of the credit crunch on families, individuals and small businesses in Scotland; believes that the Scottish Government should use the substantial levers at its disposal to give practical help; disagrees with the policy stated in the Draft Budget 2009-10 that &quot;the Scottish Government will not use the existing tax varying powers in 2009-10&quot;, and believes that all parties should work to secure a 2p reduction in the basic rate of Scottish income tax, which would deliver more than &pound;300 per year into the pay packet of the average Scottish earner and a significant fiscal stimulus to the economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2779</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>The Importance of HBOS to the Scottish Economy and Jobs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament gives a general welcome to the measures taken by the UK and other governments to tackle the current banking crisis; considers, however, that the recapitalisation plans announced by HM Treasury in October 2008 have fundamentally changed the landscape under which competition rules were waived to enable a merger between Lloyds TSB and Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS); further considers that inconsistent statements have come from the UK Treasury about whether or not the banks would independently have access to the recapitalisation funds; believes that this ambiguity is not serving anyone&rsquo;s interests in the present environment; further believes that losing HBOS corporate headquarters and jobs in Edinburgh would seriously jeopardise the city&rsquo;s position as a financial centre; sees no reason why HBOS should not be able to access UK Treasury recapitalisation and, therefore, liquidity funding on the same independent basis as other major banks, and, with this in mind, considers it a very real possibility that an independent HBOS solution could be found that may well be in the best interests of shareholders, employees, customers and the Scottish economy at large.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2778</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Closure of BA&rsquo;s Glasgow Cabin Crew Base</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave concern about British Airway&rsquo;s decision to close its Glasgow cabin crew base, as a result of which staff are being required either to relocate to London or accept voluntary redundancy; expresses concern about the implications for services between London and Scottish airports, and urges members and the public to sign up to the e-petition at www.saveBAscotland.co.uk, which seeks the retention of both the base and the jobs of almost 140 Scottish cabin crew.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2777</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Non-Native Invasive Species</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Invasive Non-Native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain; notes that this is one of the first comprehensive strategies on invasive non-native species to be developed in Europe; further welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to work in partnership with governments and organisations across these islands to implement the strategy, and acknowledges that continued efforts are required by all partners to progress the key actions of the strategy.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2776</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Mental Health in the Workplace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Scottish Development Centre for Mental Health and the Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives on establishing a pilot project to raise awareness of the overall benefits of healthy inclusive workplaces in relation to mental health and improving support for workers with mental health issues and hopes that the knowledge gained from this pilot will lead to a further reduction in stigma and contribute to a healthier working environment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2775</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Gael Power - BBC Alba, Publication of First Viewing Figures and Freeview</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes publication of the first viewing figures for BBC Alba of over 610,000, which is substantially larger than the audience of 250,000 that the BBC wanted to attract; believes that this is a good indication of the future success of the channel and congratulates BBC Alba for its variety and originality in programming, for example showing the Scotland versus Russia women&rsquo;s football match; is concerned that BBC Alba is only available to those with subscriptions to Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media, but not on Freeview, the most popular digital system; further believes that the exclusion of BBC Alba from Freeview denies many Gaelic speakers, and those with an interest, a chance to view the channel and also to be included in the viewing figures, and calls on the BBC to address access to Freeview sooner than 2010 and to establish how many viewers are unable to view the channel but would if Freeview was available.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ken Macintosh<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2774</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>International Robert W Service Verse Speaking Competition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that the International Robert W Service Verse Speaking Competition is to be held in Beith on 28 February 2009; notes the connection between Robert Service and the people of Ayrshire and, in particular, the town of Kilwinning where he grew up; acknowledges that this contest represents an opportunity for his works to be promoted both in Scotland and on the world stage and could form part of the Homecoming Scotland 2009 programme; agrees that events such as this play a vital role in enhancing Scotland&rsquo;s cultural heritage, and therefore thanks the Barrmill Jolly Beggars Burns Club for organising the event.</p>
<p>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2773</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Ian McColl</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its sadness at the death of John Miller &quot;Ian&quot; McColl on 25 October 2008, aged 81; recognises his contribution to Scottish football and considers that he will be missed by all fans of the game of football; notes that he played for Rangers FC for 15 years between 1945 and 1960, made a total of 526 appearances for the Glasgow club and won 14 caps for Scotland; recognises his success as manager of Scotland when appointed in 1961 and that he had one of the best records as Scotland manager, with successes including winning the British Home Championships in 1962 and 1963 and securing famous victories such as beating Spain 6-2 in Madrid, and believes that Ian McColl was one of the true greats of Scottish football.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2772</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Adoption of A70 as a Trunk Road</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that there is a need for major investment in Ayrshire&rsquo;s strategic road network; welcomes the completed improvement works to the A77 over recent years and planned improvement works to this route still to be undertaken; further believes that if the economy of Ayrshire is to prosper then the A70, which links southern Ayrshire to the M74, must be upgraded, and calls on the Scottish Government to recognise the significance of this route to the economic development of Ayrshire by adopting the A70 as a trunk road.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2771</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Neonatal Care in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 2008 report into neonatal care in Scotland by Bliss, the charity for babies born too soon, too small or too sick; notes with concern that Scotland has a higher rate of premature births than England and Wales and that this rate has been steadily increasing for at least the last 25 years, and further welcomes the commitment of Bliss to Scotland with the opening of a Scottish office.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2770</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Rotary International</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the work of Rotary International, a worldwide organisation of more than 1.2 million business, professional, and community leaders; notes that prospective members must actively hold or be retired from a professional, proprietary, executive or managerial position; is aware that members of Rotary clubs, known as Rotarians, undertake charitable work, provide humanitarian services, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations and help build goodwill and peace in the world; notes that there are 204 Rotary clubs with 6,748 members in Scotland, and acknowledges the work of Rotary International in its various worldwide campaigns and especially its polio campaign, where Rotarians work in collaboration with organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and UNICEF to eradicate completely that terrible disease.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2769</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Sexual Offences (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2767.1</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>British-Irish Council</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2767) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;Scottish ministers&rsquo;&quot; to end and insert &quot;proposal for the Council to take forward a workstream on renewable energy; encourages Scottish ministers to work in co-operation with all the members of the British-Irish Council, and encourages them to continue to support the Council in addressing issues of real and common concern.&quot;</p>
