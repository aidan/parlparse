That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </p>
          <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at</strong> <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></p>

          <p align="center"><strong> New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2811# David McLetchie:Restriction of Primary School Intakes in Edinburgh&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament deplores the decision of the Labour administration of the City of Edinburgh Council to use the provisions of section 44(4) of the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 to limit primary one intakes in six schools in Edinburgh, namely Murrayburn, Trinity, Hermitage Park, the Royal High, Preston Street and St. Mary&rsquo;s Leith, to allow the local authority to reduce teacher numbers and costs in future years; notes that this was not the stated intention of the Scottish Executive when the Bill was considered by the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, at which time the Minister indicated that the measure was intended to allow local authorities to maintain statutory class-size limits and avoid increases in the number of teachers or classes in future years; condemns the council&rsquo;s introduction of this measure without consultation with parents, and notes that it will lead to an increase in the number of composite classes and an unnecessary restriction on parental choice.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2810 Carolyn Leckie:Solidarity with the NUJ and BECTU&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises the magnitude of the anger demonstrated by the recent NUJ and BECTU industrial action ballot results; applauds the solidarity expressed by their membership but deplores the actions of BBC management that have led to the imminent dispute, and believes that the BBC should take urgent action to begin meaningful negotiations and reach agreement with the trade unions to secure employment and quality public service broadcasting.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2809 Brian Adam:Aberdeen Airport Noise Mitigation&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament calls on BAA, in light of Aberdeen City Council&rsquo;s decision to allow the 24-hour opening of Aberdeen Airport, to investigate the possibility of upgrading soundproofing and other noise mitigation devices to both council and privately-owned homes under the flight path and to consult the UK Noise Association in a review of the noise monitoring measures to reflect more accurately the real disturbances experienced by those living under the flight path.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2808 Brian Adam:NUJ Freelance Day of Action 7 June 2005&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament commends the NUJ for the proactive way it is promoting the work of its freelance members through a day of action on 7 June 2005 and recognises the importance of NUJ freelance contributors to a high quality, diverse and free press in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2792 Christine Grahame:The Lancastria&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that 17 June 2005 will mark the 65th anniversary of the sinking of the former Clyde-built liner and requisitioned troopship, Lancastria, which was sunk by enemy action whilst loading the remainder of the British Expeditionary Force from France in 1940, five miles off the French coastal town of St Nazaire; notes that the sinking is the worst naval disaster in British maritime history, claiming the lives of more than 4,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and civilian refugees, a grim death toll greater than the combined loss of life in the Titanic and Lusitania disasters; notes and commends the efforts of the local French people during the rescue operation in assisting the survivors and tending to the burial of the hundreds of victims washed ashore in the months following the sinking; pays tribute to both the survivors and victims of the disaster, men, women and children who have been forgotten by history; notes the D-Notice banning news of the sinking ordered by Winston Churchill which effectively remains in place in the United Kingdom to this day; notes that the Shetland-born captain of Lancastria, Captain Sharp, was instructed by Royal Navy officers under orders from the Admiralty in London to load as many people as possible &ldquo;without regard to the limits set down under international law&rdquo;, loading some estimated 9,000 people on a ship which normally would carry just over 2,000, and that this was a significant contributory factor in the scale of the disaster; urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to recognise formally the sacrifice made by both victims and survivors of the Lancastria by commissioning a special Lancastria medal, following the precedent set by the Dunkirk medal, to be awarded whether <em>in vivo </em>or posthumously to all of the victims of the disaster, and asserts that this would in some small way recognise what has become a forgotten sacrifice and would offer the relatives of victims the peace of mind that their loved ones had not died in vain and were being duly, if belatedly, remembered.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2785 # Carolyn Leckie:Birth Rate and Poverty&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament is extremely concerned that, according to Professor Michael Crawford, the incidence of low birth weight has increased since the 1970s and that in some areas of Glasgow the incidence is 14%; acknowledges that the single biggest risk factor for low birth weight is poverty; is appalled that, when government tells us that the economy is buoyant and the wealthy have more than doubled their wealth since 1997, the incidence of low birth weight in Scotland is at levels associated with the poorest countries of the world; condemns successive governments for failure to prevent this humanitarian catastrophe, and believes that the health consequences for future generations will be dire unless aggressive action is taken to redistribute wealth and eradicate poverty. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2784 # Carolyn Leckie:Stop Violence Against Women&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament is concerned about the recent violent deaths of women in the context of very low conviction rates for violence against women, in particular sexual violence, and extends its concern and condolences to all the friends and families of these young women so brutally taken from the world; regrets that there remain too many outstanding, unsolved cases of murder of women; believes that reporting of these crimes stigmatises the female victims by headlines such as &ldquo;prostitute murdered&rdquo;, and further believes that all of these women are first and foremost women, daughters, mothers, sisters, partners and friends and that the focus of blame should rest on the perpetrators not the victims and that much more effort needs to be made to identify the perpetrators of these crimes and end the unacceptable level of gender-based violence in society. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2780 Irene Oldfather:Bicycle Helmets&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that the majority of deaths in cycling accidents occur as a result of head injuries; is aware that the number of pedal cyclists admitted to hospital with head injuries as a result of being involved in a transport accident was 527 in the year ending March 2004; recognises that wearing a correctly fitted helmet has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of severe injury; notes the action that the Scottish Executive has taken to date by funding the Scottish Road Safety Campaign, which develops key road safety education initiatives and encourages the use of protective headgear through the Scottish Cycle Training Scheme, but recognises, nonetheless, that further action will be required to reduce the number of cyclist deaths related to head injuries.</p>
