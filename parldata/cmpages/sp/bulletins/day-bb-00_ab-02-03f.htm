    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-497#</b> <strong>Cathy Peattie: Scottish Media Group</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with concern the growing evidence of the diminution and marginalisation
    of regional cultural content by Scottish Media Group; the reduction in regional production
    staff levels, and the consequences of these changes for the cultural identity and economic
    well-being of Scotland and its regions.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Mr Kenneth Macintosh<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong>,
    Lewis Macdonald<strong>*</strong>, Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong>, Elaine Thomson<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-496#</b> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Agrimoney Compensation for Dairy Farmers</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that many dairy farmers have seen their incomes plummet as a
    consequence of falling milk prices compounded by the strong pound; recognises that milk
    production in Scotland is heavily concentrated in Ayrshire, Dumfries and Galloway and
    Lanarkshire; acknowledges that the farming community in these areas bears the brunt of
    these market conditions; further notes that the dairy sector is eligible for agrimoney
    payments to compensate for the crippling effects of the strength of sterling; regrets that
    dairy farmers are the only eligible sector of agriculture for which no such payments have
    been made and believes that agrimoney payments should be made available to dairy farmers
    to secure the industry&#146;s future.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-495</b> <strong>Hugh Henry: National Minimum Wage</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament congratulates Her Majesty&#146;s Government for introducing a National Minimum
    Wage and recognises its contribution in helping to tackle poverty in Scotland; notes the
    role played by trade unions in campaigning for its introduction, and supports the
    introduction of an annual review of the level of the National Minimum Wage as it applies
    to both age groups.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-494</b> <strong>Hugh Henry: National Lottery</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s Government
    regarding the operation of the National Lottery and asks that, when the current contract
    with Camelot expires, the contract should be awarded to a not-for-profit organisation so
    that money raised from the lottery as private profit can be diverted into supporting more
    good causes.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-493</b> <strong>Hugh Henry: World Cup in 2006</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    sends good wishes to the English FA for its bid to host the World Cup in 2006; recognises
    the benefits which the Scottish economy may enjoy from the arrival of many visitors from
    around the world and urges that, should the English bid be successful, the Scottish
    Tourist Board will encourage visiting fans to come to Scotland.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-492</b> <strong>Hugh Henry: Warm Homes Initiative</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive on its efforts to tackle fuel poverty in
    Scotland through the Warm Homes Initiative and urges Scottish Power to abandon standing
    charges for domestic fuel as they are inflicting a burden on the lower income sections of
    society.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-491#</b> <strong>Alex Neil: Kilmarnock and Loudoun Economy</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament <span style="text-decoration: none"><a NAME="MotionText">expresses concern
    at the spate of recent factory closures in Kilmarnock and Loudoun and notes the need for
    urgent action to be taken to deal with the deep seated problems of deprivation in
    Kilmarnock and Loudoun.</a></span></p>

    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-486.1</b> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Sustainable Development</strong>&#151;As
    an amendment to motion (S1M-486) in the name of Sarah Boyack, inset at end &quot;and urges
    the Scottish Executive, in order to fulfil that commitment, to prepare, through
    consultation, a strategy for implementation including an analysis of principal issues to
    be addressed, an indication of the targets and standards expected to be met, arrangements
    for independent monitoring, and strategic direction for those expected to meet such
    commitments.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-486.2</b> <strong>Mr Murray Tosh: Sustainable Development</strong>&#151;As an
    amendment to motion (S1M-486) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out from
    &quot;places&quot; to end and insert &quot;approves the Scottish Executive&#146;s
    commitment to integrate the principles of sustainable development into all government
    policies for the benefits it brings to the people of Scotland, now and in the future, and
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that land and other resources will be made
    available for the economic development of Scotland.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">S1M-483 Air Passenger and Freight Links to Scotland</b> (lodged on 1
    February 2000) Shona Robison<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-483.1</b> <strong>Mr Murray Tosh: Air Passenger and Freight Links to
    Scotland</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-483) in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill,
    leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;and, acknowledging the
    potential for economic growth through improved air links, supports the development of a
    new Air Traffic Control Centre at Prestwick funded by private capital, calls for the
    acceleration of the Scottish Airports and Air Services Study and effective surface access
    strategies for Scotland&#146;s major airports, and calls for urgent assurances that other
    freight operators will be authorised to carry freight traffic currently carried through
    Prestwick Airport by FedEx.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-483.2</b> <strong>Tavish Scott: Air Passenger and Freight Links to
    Scotland</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-483) in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill,
    leave out from &quot;in the 21st century&quot; to end and insert &quot;and acknowledges
    the potential for economic growth through improved airlinks; notes that the future of air
    traffic control and associated issues are a reserved matter outwith the remit of the
    Parliament, but recognises that there are concerns and that the Liberal Democrats are
    opposed to the development of the air traffic control system by public private
    partnership; strongly supports a two centre strategy to protect jobs at Prestwick;
    underlines the need to give the highest possible priority to air safety, and further notes
    that during the second reading of the Transport Bill in the House of Commons on 20
    December 1999, no Scottish National Party MP spoke in the debate, and only one voted
    against the second reading of the Bill.</p>

    style="text-decoration: none"><a NAME="AmendmentText">leave out from &quot;without this
