<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">current motions</a> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Any questions in relation to this section should be directed to the Chamber Desk, for which contact details are provided at the end of the Bulletin.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00074 Christine Grahame: Raise a Glass to Scottish Borders Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the unanimous decision by Scottish Borders Council, a Liberal Democrat/Conservative/Independent administration, to support a minimum unit price for alcohol at 45p and urges members across the Parliament to follow this example.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00073 Sarah Boyack: Scottish Wildlife Trust in Europe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) will launch its publication, <em>Climate connections: towards low carbon high biodiversity economies</em>, at Scotland House, Brussels, on 25 May 2011 as part of EU Green Week; understands that the report will argue strongly that climate and biodiversity are inextricably linked and cannot be addressed in isolation from one another; considers that membership-based organisations such as SWT have an important and positive role to play in the development of public policy; congratulates SWT for highlighting what it sees as the role of healthy and biologically diverse ecosystems in adapting to and mitigating climate change and for its initiative in producing evidence-based policy and taking it to the heart of Europe, and commends the People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery and Scottish Natural Heritage for their financial support for SWT without which, it considers, nature conservation, public engagement and Scottish public policy would be diminished.</p>
<p>Supported by: Liam McArthur*, Drew Smith*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00072 Patricia Ferguson: The Concrete Garden</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises all of those involved with the Concrete Garden in Possilpark; notes that the garden was created with a small budget but with a great deal of thought, ingenuity and community involvement; welcomes the contribution that the garden makes to the life of Possilpark, and congratulates the organisers on winning the prestigious chairman&rsquo;s prize at the Scottish Design Awards.</p>
<p>Supported by: Paul Martin*, Jackie Baillie*, Drew Smith*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00071 John Wilson: MS Week 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of National MS Week, which will take place from 23 to 29 May 2011; further notes the particular significance of multiple sclerosis (MS) to Scotland; understands that Scotland has the highest reported prevalence of MS anywhere in the world; congratulates the MS Society on what it considers to be the ground-breaking research that it undertakes with others into the causes, symptoms and treatments of MS; supports the MS Register project, which, for the first time in the United Kingdom, aims to provide an accurate picture of how MS impacts on the lives of people living with it; hopes that this will lead to better-directed research, treatment and services, and welcomes the MS Society&rsquo;s reception at Our Dynamic Earth, Edinburgh, on 24 May to celebrate MS week and launch the MS Register project.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00070 James Dornan: Community Education at the University of Strathclyde</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, since 1964, the University of Strathclyde&rsquo;s Jordanhill campus has provided what it considers to be a world-leading course in community education; notes that this course has provided graduates who have gone on to work in a range of professions including community learning and development, health improvement, youth service and community regeneration; further notes that, despite reports of widespread student and staff opposition, it is one of four courses that the university proposes to cut; believes that communities in Scotland require skilled community educators to help deliver a number of national and local government initiatives, and calls on the university principal and court to re-evaluate these proposals and commit to securing the future for all subjects under threat of closure.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Rob Gibson*, Roderick Campbell*, Kenneth Gibson*, Paul Wheelhouse*, Humza Yousaf*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00069 Ken Macintosh: Proposed Cuts to Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Strathclyde</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern regarding proposed cuts to the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Strathclyde and, in particular, plans to withdraw degree courses in music, community education, geography and sociology; worries that, as well as the loss of jobs and the immediate impact on staff and students, such a move narrows the breadth of the higher education (HE) curriculum at Strathclyde; highlights anxiety that ad hoc decisions taken by individual HE institutions could have a far reaching cumulative effect on the range and accessibility of HE courses for Scottish undergraduates, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that Scottish universities continue to offer a world-class education across all disciplines.</p>
