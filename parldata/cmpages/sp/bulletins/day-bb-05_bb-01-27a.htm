          <p align="center"><strong>  Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
          <p> 9.30 am Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
          <p> The Clerk has been advised of the topic of the following Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Business </p>
          <p> <em>followed by</em> Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Energy Policy&mdash;</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> S2M-2320 Alex Johnstone: <strong>Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s renewable energy policy is unduly biased in favour of wind power to the detriment of other renewable technologies, which has led to widespread local opposition to wind farm developments throughout the country and to higher costs for electricity; furthermore agrees with Allan Wilson MSP, Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, that the concerns of security of supply and the need for emission reductions mean that it is time for an open-minded debate into the future of nuclear energy in Scotland; supports John Home Robertson MSP&rsquo;s proposal for a Cross Party Group on the civil nuclear industry, and calls on the Executive to work in partnership with the UK Government to create a long-term plan for Scotland&rsquo;s energy needs which balances renewable production with nuclear energy. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> S2M-2320.4 Allan Wilson:<strong> Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S2M-2320) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &ldquo;is concerned&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s study into present and future energy supply and demand in Scotland; supports the Executive&rsquo;s position of not supporting the further development of nuclear power stations while waste management issues remain unresolved; supports the Executive&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the development of renewable energy in Scotland, including wind, wave, tidal, solar and biomass power, as a key element of a b alanced energy supply portfolio; supports the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to achieving 40% renewable electricity generation by 2020, and welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s proposal in the Review of the Climate Change Programme to create an Energy Efficiency Strategy for Scotland.&rdquo; </p>
            <p> S2M-2320.2 Richard Lochhead:<strong> Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S2M-2320) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &ldquo;is concerned&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;believes that Scotland is well placed to be Europe&rsquo;s energy powerhouse given our massive energy resources; believes that onshore and offshore wind energy is an important element in a balanced renewables policy but that the development of other renewables must be accelerated; shares the frustration expressed by many others, including Highland Council and the Parliament&rsquo;s Enterprise and Culture Committee, who are calling for a national strategic framework for wind farm developments; calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the UK Government does not introduce any charging scheme for access to the grid that discriminates against renewables in Scotland; believes that no new nuclear power stations should be built in Scotland, and calls for the Scottish Parliament to have control over energy policy and oil and gas revenues.&rdquo; </p>
            <p> S2M-2320.3 Shiona Baird:<strong> Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S2M-2320) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &ldquo;is concerned&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;welcomes the political consensus that climate change is a reality and that alternatives to fossil fuel energy sources must be developed in order to curtail emissions of greenhouse gases; strongly believes that Scotland&rsquo;s energy future requires a wide range of environmentally-sustainable energy sources; agrees with the Enterprise and Culture Committee&rsquo;s Inquiry into renewable energy that Scotland needs to develop urgently all forms of renewable energy including marine, on and off-shore wind and solar sources; believes that a much greater focus on energy efficiency across all sectors must be central to any energy policy; notes the International Atomic Energy Agency&rsquo;s view that nuclear power will be unable to halt climate change and considers that the case for nuclear power in Scotland&rsquo;s long-term energy future remains completely unconvincing, and calls for more powers over energy policy to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.&rdquo; </p>
            <p> S2M-2320.1 Frances Curran:<strong> Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S2M-2320) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &ldquo;and to higher&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;; calls on the Executive to state categorically that no new nuclear power stations will be built in Scotland, bring forward the closure dates of all existing nuclear power stations in Scotland, initiate an immediate programme of investment in all aspects of renewable energy and create a publicly-owned, publicly-resourced renewable energy industry.&rdquo; </p>
