                        <strong>Mr Keith Harding:</strong> <strong>Homelessness in Fife</strong>—That 
                        the Parliament notes that homelessness in Fife has risen 
                        38% over the past three years, affecting 3,388 households 
                        and that the figures for Scotland show an increase of 
                        12% over the same period; further notes that this has 
                        occurred at a time when Fife Council has failed to collect 
                        millions of pounds of rent arrears and lost income from 
                        unlet properties, and recognises that these resources 
                        could have been used to bring unlet homes back into use 
                        or for better computer systems to match people to homes 
                        as part of a programme to help alleviate homelessness 
                        in the Kingdom. </font></p>
