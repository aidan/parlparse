<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am&#9;</strong>Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Student Hardship&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4188</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Student Hardship</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls for a cross-party approach on tackling hardship among the poorest students in Scotland; believes that students have been severely let down by the SNP&rsquo;s broken promises, actions and inaction in power; further believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning&rsquo;s efforts have been misplaced in focussing solely on reducing graduate debt rather than student hardship while student demand for hardship and childcare funds increases, commercial borrowing among students continues and student support levels in Scotland fall far behind the rest of the United Kingdom; notes the open letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning signed by NUS, the main opposition parties and student leaders across Scotland calling for the Scottish Government to increase levels of student support through increased loans and for a new direction from the Scottish Government; further notes that on the 12 March 2009, through motion S3M-3675 as amended, the Parliament rejected all of the proposals contained in the <em>Supporting a Smarter Scotland </em>consultation, which closed in April 2009, for not adequately addressing student hardship, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the main opposition parties on their joint approach to tackling student hardship by using the available resources to provide &pound;7,000 in support for the poorest students, a &pound;500 increase in grant for the poorest students, an increase in support of &pound;200 for all students through the non-means-tested loan and almost &pound;2 million to discretionary funds for childcare and hardship funding. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4188.2</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Student Hardship</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4188) in the name of Claire Baker, leave out from first&nbsp;&quot;calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the proposals from Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats contained in their responses to the <em>Supporting a Smarter Scotland </em>consultation; notes motion S3M-3675 as amended whereby the&nbsp;Parliament called on the Scottish Government to tackle student hardship, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with all political parties to deliver specific proposals to tackle student hardship, particularly during this time of recession.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4188.1</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Student Hardship</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4188) in the name of Claire Baker, insert at end &quot;and agrees that the Scottish Government should make further progress towards the provision of an adequate minimum income guarantee for all students.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Supporting Employment in Scotland&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4187</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Supporting Employment in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that 34,000 extra Scots were out of a job in the last year and that many live under the threat of redundancy; recognises that government support for business and individuals is vital in the current climate; calls on the Scottish Government to examine the ProAct scheme developed by the Welsh Assembly Government, which supports businesses on short-time working, with a view to developing a similar initiative in Scotland; further recognises the seriousness of the economic situation in Scotland; believes that the Scottish Government should bring forward a new and revised economic recovery programme prior to summer recess, and calls for such a plan to outline how the Scottish Government intends to deliver the extra 7,800 apprenticeship places agreed for 2009 and the 75,000 training places announced by the First Minister on 18 April 2009. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4187.2</strong> <strong>Jim Mather: Supporting Employment in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4187) in the name of John Park, leave out from &quot;with&quot; to first &quot;Scotland&quot; and insert &quot;to establish whether or not a scheme would benefit Scotland&rsquo;s economic recovery&quot;.</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4187.1</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Supporting Employment in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4187) in the name of John Park, insert at end &quot;; regrets the flat-lining of budgets for colleges and universities in the spending review period announced in 2007 and the dramatic real-terms cuts in operational funding for Scottish Enterprise and the new agency, Skills Development Scotland; expresses concern at the impact that this will have on the sector&rsquo;s ability to accommodate increased training demand in the workforce, and fears that this could lead to a slower recovery for Scotland from the recession.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>11.40 am</strong>&#9;General Question Time&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>1. Cathy Peattie:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will extend the national concessionary travel scheme to include demand-responsive community transport schemes such as Dial-a-Journey in Forth Valley, which is used by older and disabled people who are eligible for the scheme but cannot use scheduled services. (S3O-7024)</p>
<p><strong>2. Derek Brownlee:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive which areas of the public sector are not covered by its commitment to avoid compulsory redundancies. (S3O-6976)</p>
