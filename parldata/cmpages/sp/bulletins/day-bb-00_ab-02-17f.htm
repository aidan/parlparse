    Hospital (Dumbarton)</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the possible
    closure of the maternity unit at Vale of Leven Hospital, Dumbarton; believes that it is
    not acceptable for expectant mothers to be forced to travel from Dumbarton to Glasgow for
    maternity services, and further believes that the West of Scotland NHS Trust should
    reverse this closure decision.</p>

    (S1M-550) in the name of Mr Alasdair Morrison, leave out from &quot;publication&quot; to
    end and insert &quot;vision for Scottish tourism set out in the New Strategy for Scottish
    Tourism, but believes that this vision will not be achieved unless effective action is
    taken by the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty&#146;s Government to tackle the problem
    facing the industry in Scotland of relative competitive disadvantage; calls upon the
    Scottish Executive to give further careful consideration to the responses to the
    consultation paper and to provide, as a focus for a wide ranging public debate, an
    analysis of the responses, thereby demonstrating that it takes seriously the submissions
    made by the industry, and further believes that Scotland should be ready and willing to
    learn from its competitors, such as Ireland, in order to promote best practice in the home
    tourist industry.&quot;<i><strong> </strong></i></p>
