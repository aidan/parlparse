<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4468 David Whitton: East Dunbartonshire Mini Water Polo</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the six schools in East Dunbartonshire, Balmuildy, Wester Cleddens, Lenzie Moss, Meadowburn, St Joseph&rsquo;s and Torrance Primary, on reaching the finals of the Scottish Swimming and Kellogg&rsquo;s Swim Active mini-polo finals; notes that Balmuildy Primary 5 and Meadowburn Primary 6 won the gold medals; also notes that the Kellogg&rsquo;s Swim Active initiative has been a great success in East Dunbartonshire, introducing mini-polo to over 2,500 children in the course of this academic year, and hopes that it can be rolled out across other local authorities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4467 John Swinney: Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4466 Kenny MacAskill: The Draft Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008 (Consequential Modifications) Order 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that the draft Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008 (Consequential Modifications) Order 2009 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4465 Jim Mather: Arbitration (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Arbitration (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4464 John Swinney: Climate Change (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4463 Bill Kidd: Foreign Affairs Committee Calls for Trident Debate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes calls by the Foreign Affairs Committee in its report, <em>Global Security: Non-Proliferation</em>, for a debate in the House of Commons in 2009 on the Initial Gate stage of the Trident replacement project, when the decision to start initial design work is to be made, so that the issue can be sufficiently scrutinised; believes that the cross-party support for Jeremy Corbyn MP&rsquo;s Early Day Motion (EDM 660) that &quot;requests that the Initial Gate decision be delayed until Parliament is in session and can be presented with the report for scrutiny&quot; provides a clear indication of the consensus that exists, irrespective of party allegiances, for transparency and democratic accountability surrounding the Trident replacement debate, and considers that the attempt to approve this multi-billion pound project behind closed doors flies in the face of appeals for increased transparency on the part of the profligate UK Government.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4447 Kenneth Gibson: Calman Commission A Wasted Opportunity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disappointed with the rather timid recommendations set forth in the publication, <em>Serving Scotland Better: Scotland and the United Kingdom in the 21st Century</em>; believes that proposals merely to redraw Scotland&rsquo;s complex relationship with Westminster would only perpetuate a complex constitutional mess; regrets that the outcome of this report seems largely predetermined by an unrepresentative unionist clique as evidenced by the convenient sidestepping of full fiscal autonomy and veto powers, the paucity of public meetings and the commission&rsquo;s own stated objective of securing the union; recognises the National Conversation to be much more democratic in its deliberations, considering as it does all constitutional options; sees the Isle of Man and other crown dependencies flourishing through self-governance and wonders why Scotland is not recommended the same privilege; notes that these crown dependencies have long successfully governed in many areas that the commission appears to believe Scotland incapable of managing, such as varying the tax regime, setting energy policy, regulating health professionals, running the postal system and meeting our unique immigration needs; recognises that the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey and the other Channel Islands, with a population of less than 200,000 among them, are entirely self-supporting, receive no subsidies from the United Kingdom and even make an annual contribution to Westminster for defence services; welcomes any increased powers but is disappointed that Scotland will still be denied its own oil revenues and considers limited borrowing to be a far cry from a long-term solution; agrees with those economists who state that the Calman recommendations are at best an opportunity missed and at worst a recipe for economic instability; acknowledges the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government best suited to their needs, as stated in the Scotland Act 1998, and therefore seeks the public&rsquo;s view on this non-consensus document through referendum; suggests that there is no reason why the Scottish people should not decide how they should be governed; believes that these issues could simply be resolved by full Scottish independence, as any other system would restrict Scotland&rsquo;s potential as an enterprising nation, and looks to take Scotland forward following a positive result in the free and fair referendum that the Scottish Government proposes to hold in 2010.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4429 Kenneth Gibson: Sizewell Nuclear Leak</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its grave concern at the long-overdue disclosure of unauthorized radioactive release from Sizewell nuclear power station, exposing the site&rsquo;s culture of non-compliance and absolute negligence; is appalled that such a sensitive facility would operate in a seemingly non-existent control environment where proper training and nuclear site licence conditions have been set aside; is aware that leaking radioactive material was detected only when a contractor went to wash laundry and that this chance discovery led to the prevention of the irradiated fuel becoming uncovered and a potential airborne off-site release; finds it beyond belief that a nuclear disaster was averted only by pure luck and that public safety should be dependent on fortuitous events; considers that the power plant&rsquo;s pond system pipe work was mistakenly constructed with simple PVC pipe and wonders why this serious anomaly was not discovered at any time during the 40-year life of the plant or during the safety reviews after two similar accidents; considers that this highlights a disturbingly endless trend of alarm failure and ignorance at Sizewell; acknowledges that the central processing unit (CPU) controlling the alarm system had failed, resulting in a standing alarm, which sounded for two days without anybody recording it in a log or investigating; believes that the relay-based alarm system was poorly installed and never actually operational, the pond level alarm was incorrectly modified and would not have worked if pond level detectors had tried to initiate it and that a fluid detection system should have sounded an alarm from the pipe&rsquo;s discharge but at the time the system was not fully installed; regrets that all these alarms were of little consequence because the alarm&rsquo;s computer software was also found to be malfunctioning and that, even if the software and alarms had operated properly, they would have been masked by the CPU&rsquo;s standing alarm, which was being ignored in the master control room; further regrets that a nuclear power station, built with substantial public investment and potentially representing a significant health risk, would be operated with ignorance of standing alarms, failure of inspection and oversight and in a shroud of secrecy; considers that UK ministers would prefer to ignore freedom of information requests while spending their time promoting a generation of new reactors; insists that the UK Government allays suspicion of similarly undisclosed accidents by ending this ongoing lack of disclosure, and hopes that UK ministers will recognise the wisdom, foresight and public benefit of clean, green energy sources, which seemingly, as experienced so often under Labour, have been ignored.</p>
