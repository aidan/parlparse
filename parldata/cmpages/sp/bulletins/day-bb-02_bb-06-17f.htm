          <p><strong>*S1M-3221</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Kurdish Political 
            Party, PKK</strong>-That the Parliament calls upon Her Majesty's Government 
            to withdraw the Kurdish political party, the PKK, from the Terrorism 
            2000 list in light of the PKK's declaration of an end to its military 
            campaign in 2001.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3220</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Holyrood Project 
            and Israeli Goods</strong>-That the Parliament calls upon the Scottish 
            Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Holyrood Progress Group not to 
            source goods or services for the Holyrood Project from any company 
            trading with the state of Israel.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3219</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Batasuna</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns the decision of the Spanish Government to 
            proscribe the Basque National Party Batasuna and calls upon Her Majesty's 
            Government to resist any attempts by the Spanish Government to add 
            Batasuna to the European list of terrorist organisations.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3218</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Detention of 
            Marwan Al Barghouti</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the continued 
            detention without trial of the Palestinian parliamentarian Marwan 
            Al Barghouti by the Government of Israel and calls upon Her Majesty's 
            Government to use all its efforts to secure his release.</p>

            Area Centre Project Management Team and the 2002 Prize for Public 
            Management Leadership</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 
            Dalmellington Area Centre Project Management Team which consists of 
            officers from Ayrshire &amp; Arran Primary Care NHS Trust, East Ayrshire 
            Council and Strathclyde Police on achieving the Office for Public 
            Management 2002 prize for Public Management Leadership, and looks 
            forward to the roll-out across Scotland of this partnership template 
            for providing one stop public facilities.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3216</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Financial Disadvantage 
            of Glasgow City Council</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continuing 
            damage to the city of Glasgow as a direct result of the Tory reorganisation 
            of local government in 1996; further notes that Glasgow's first budget 
            after reorganisation in 1996-97 resulted in a £63 million reduction 
            in expenditure and a 19.1% increase in council tax, that the following 
            two years' budgets increased the council tax by 22% and 9.4% respectively 
            while reducing local authority jobs by over 5,000 since local government 
            reorganisation, that Glasgow's budget has increased by 14.5% (only 
            1.2% in real terms) compared to a Scottish average of 22.5% (8.2% 
            in real terms) and its council tax has increased by 39% compared to 
            a Scottish average of 31% and that the &quot;mismatch&quot; of funding 
            caused by reorganisation is a major cause of Glasgow's reduced expenditure 
            but higher council tax; is aware that Glasgow City Council is still 
            compelled to spend £36 million more on education and social work than 
            it receives in government support, such is the high level of deprivation 
            and poverty within the city, while its council tax at £1,141 for Band 
            D is the highest in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to respond 
            positively to the report by Professor Arthur Midwinter which highlights 
            the need for Glasgow to receive £32.6 million in supplementary grant 
            as its share of the £50 million owed to all local authorities financially 
            disadvantaged by the &quot;mismatch&quot; of funds after local government 
            reorganisation, and believes that Glasgow and the other affected local 
            authorities should receive the supplementary grants within the current 
            financial year.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3215</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Adults with Incapacity 
            (Specified Medical Treatments) (Scotland) Regulations 2002</strong>-That 
            the Health and Community Care Committee recommends that nothing further 
            be done under the Adults with Incapacity (Specified Medical Treatments) 
            (Scotland) Regulations 2002 (SSI 2002/275).</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Margo MacDonald, Alex Neil, Andrew Wilson, Mr Lloyd 
            Quinan, Mr Gil Paterson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3214</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Job Losses at O2 
            Call Centre, Thurso</strong>-That the Parliament expresses deep concern 
            over the job losses that have occurred at the O2 call centre in Thurso; 
            notes the detrimental economic impact that this will have on the local 
            area; recognises the difficulty of suitable job relocation for the 
            workforce in the immediate area, and urges action from the Scottish 
            Executive, Her Majesty's Government and Highlands and Islands Enterprise 
            to assist Manpower in finding other contracts which would fully utilise 
            the distinctive skill base of the workforce and, if necessary, find 
            the recruitment opportunities and/or training services to help the 
            workforce find alternative employment.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3213</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Faslane Peace 
            Camp</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Faslane peace 
            camp on achieving its 20th<sup> </sup>year of peaceful protest in 
            the campaign for a nuclear-free world.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3212</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: European Commission 
            Initiatives on the By-catching of Dolphins, Porpoises and Pilot Whales 
            in Fishing Gear</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the initiatives 
            finally being taken by the European Commission and other interested 
            parties to reduce and perhaps one day eliminate the inadvertent slaughter 
            of dolphins, porpoises and pilot whales trapped in the nets of trawlers 
            operating in waters close to Scotland's coastline and elsewhere; is 
            convinced that Scottish fishermen will readily engage with scientists 
            and others in an effort to reduce dramatically this needless slaughter, 
            and believes that it has an important role to play in the implementation 
            of rules and regulations governing the use of whatever means are needed 
            to protect such important marine species.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3211</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Private Hire Vehicles 
            (Carriage of Guide Dogs etc.) Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That 
            the Parliament endorses the principle of including in the Private 
            Hire Vehicles (Carriage of Guide Dogs etc.) Bill a power for Scottish 
            Ministers to regulate for the carriage of guide and other assistance 
            dogs in private hire cars in Scotland and agrees that the relevant 
            provisions to achieve this end in the Bill should be considered by 
            the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3210#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie: Causing Death 
            by Dangerous Driving</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication 
            of the report by the Transport Research Laboratory, <em>Road Safety 
            Research Report No.26, Dangerous Driving and the Law,</em> which examines 
            the use and application of the law on careless and dangerous driving 
            throughout the UK; supports the report where it states that in Scotland 
            a "clearer message regarding the seriousness of these offences would 
            be sent to both defendant and society if all causing death by dangerous 
            driving cases were tried in the High Court" rather than sheriff courts, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should (a) commission specific 
            Scottish research in this area to take on board the report's conclusions 
            and recommendations and (b) take the necessary steps to ensure that 
            dangerous driving offences are heard in the appropriate court and 
            not downgraded.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3209</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: University of St Andrews 
            (Postgraduate Medical Degrees) Bill - Stage 3</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees that the University of St Andrews (Postgraduate Medical Degrees) 
            Bill be passed.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3208#</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Lanark Racecourse</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the proposals for development that would enable 
            Lanark Racecourse to once again host first-class horse racing events; 
            commends the efforts of local individuals behind such proposals and, 
            in particular, Mr David Hughes; offers full cross-party support to 
            these endeavours which will greatly enhance the social and economic 
            regeneration of Lanark and the surrounding communities; encourages 
            the UK horse racing authorities to do all in their power to enable 
            the proposals to come to fruition, and looks forward to the day when 
            the race for the Silver Bell, the UK's oldest racing trophy, is once 
            more a regular fixture at Lanark.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Karen Gillon</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3207</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Peebles Sheriff 
            Court</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the threat of 
            the permanent closure of Peebles Sheriff Court; further notes that 
            the Minister for Justice is currently considering a report into the 
            expenditure required to make the courthouse fully operational and 
            intends to make his conclusion public soon; further notes that the 
            retention of the sheriff court at Peebles is supported by, <em>inter 
            alia,</em> the Sheriff Principal of Lothian and Borders, the two sheriffs 
            who sit there, the Society of Solicitors in the Shires of Selkirk 
            and Peebles and the Faculty of Solicitors in Roxburghshire, and urges 
            the Scottish Executive, in implementing its commitment to access to 
            justice for all, to keep a sheriff court at Peebles, either refurbished 
            or new build.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3206 Trish Godman on behalf of the Local Government Committee: 
            Local Government Committee, Inquiry into Local Government Finance</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the 6th Report 2002 of the Local Government Committee, 
            <em>Inquiry into Local Government Finance</em> (SP Paper 551) and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to consider the report's recommendations.

          <p><strong>S1M-3205#</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Neurosurgery for 
            Mental Disorder</strong>-That the Parliament notes the imminent introduction 
            of regulations regarding the use of neurosurgery for mental disorder 
            (NMD); acknowledges the resolution of the General Assembly of the 
            United Nations A/RES/46/119 17 December 1991, Principle 11 (14) which 
            states &quot;Psychosurgery and other intrusive and irreversible treatments 
            for mental disorder shall never be carried out on a patient who is 
            an involuntary patient in a mental health facility and, to the extent 
            that domestic law permits them to be carried out, they may be carried 
            out on any other patient only where the patient has given informed 
            consent and an independent external body has satisfied itself that 
            there is genuine informed consent and that the treatment best serves 
            the health needs of the patient&quot;, and considers that the Parliament 
            and the Health and Community Care Committee should assess the implications 
            of such regulations for basic human rights whilst taking into consideration 
            the report from the NMD service in Dundee which does not support the 
            use of such procedures on patients who are incapable of giving informed 
            consent.</p>

            Scotland and Southern Africa</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            anniversary of the uprising of South African schoolchildren and students 
            in Soweto and across South Africa on 16 June 1976; recognises the 
            historic roles played by young people, trade unionists, political 
            activists, church folk and internationalists in the struggle for the 
            defeat of apartheid and its supporters and for the establishment of 
            a non-racial, democratic South Africa; resolves to send its warmest 
            greetings to the Government and people of South Africa around this 
            historic day; further recognises that the final victory against the 
            apartheid system came on the heels of sacrifice, commitment and travail 
            by men and women, young and old, Governments, organisations and institutions 
            of various kinds resolved to uproot the evil system of apartheid and 
            that their shared efforts bore fruit on 27 April 1994, when South 
            Africa attained democratic rule under Nelson Mandela; recognises that 
            the new leadership, resurgent economies and greater democracy at the 
            centre of the promotion of the African Renaissance are in the interests 
            not just of African countries and African peoples but also of the 
            whole world; believes that the Scottish Executive and MSPs should 
            ensure that innovative measures and opportunities for the development 
            of mutual support and understanding between the peoples of Scotland 
            and southern Africa are addressed across all Executive departments 
            and across the responsibilities of the committees of the Parliament,

            to Dust and Allergens</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the considerable role exposure to house dust mites and other allergens 
            plays in triggering asthma and allergies; commends the work of the 
            British Allergy Foundation in highlighting and promoting quality building

          <p> <strong>S1M-3193</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant: The Loch Ness Partnership</strong>-That 
            the Parliament supports the work of the organisations involved in 
            the Loch Ness partnership and the launch of their initial plan for 
            the area; notes the importance of sustainable economic and social 
            development to the area while ensuring that the unique environment 
            is respected; further notes that particular focus has been placed 
            on maximising business opportunities, marketing, land and transport, 
            and congratulates all those involved in promoting the Loch Ness area.

          <p><strong>S1M-3191#</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Dundee Heritage 
            Trust</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that our industrial 
            heritage is of interest to many people from other countries as well 
            as Scots; notes with concern, however, that despite strenuous efforts 
            and exploration of all possible funding opportunities, Dundee Heritage 
            Trust, the charity which owns Dundee's leading tourist attractions, 
            RRS Discovery and the Verdant Works, has been forced by a continuing 
            and critical shortfall in revenue support into a series of cost-cutting 
            exercises and staff redundancies, the latest being the loss of their 
            very experienced and committed chief executive; recognises that the 
            seriousness of this move cannot be underestimated and is a worrying 
            indication that the closure of both Discovery Point and the Verdant 
            Works may now be imminent; considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            put in place a financial package with immediate effect and extend 
            central revenue support as part of a longer term strategy to secure 
            the future of these significant visitor attractions, both of which 
            achieved five star grading by VisitScotland, with Dundee Heritage 
            Trust being the only independent operator in Scotland to achieve this 
            accolade, and notes that the loss of RRS Discovery, which gives the 
            city of Dundee its "identity" and the Verdant Works, the last working 
            jute mill in Scotland and European Industrial Museum of the Year in 
            1999, to the cultural heritage of the nation would be both significant 
            and irreplaceable.</p>

            Mr Lennox Lewis on his great victory as World Boxing Council and International 
            Boxing Federation heavyweight boxing champion; regards him as an excellent 
            role model for young people of all backgrounds and a fine ambassador 
            for our country, and extends a cordial invitation to him to visit 
            the Parliament on his next trip to Scotland.</p>

            in the Edinburgh Green Belt</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            decision of Midlothian Council to commence the construction of a large 
            roundabout near Roslin, Midlothian, despite the fact that objections 
            to the proposal at the Midlothian Local Plan Inquiry have not yet 
            been resolved; believes that the proposals as they stand are inappropriate 
            in scale and damaging to a fragile area of Edinburgh's Green Belt, 
            and therefore calls on Midlothian Council to review the decision through 
            a process of consultation on how transport links on the A701 can be 
            best improved and the quality of the Green Belt protected.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3171#</strong> <strong>David Mundell: VisitScotland Funding 
            of Dumfries and Galloway Tourist Board Foot-and-Mouth Recovery Plan</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with extreme concern the failure of VisitScotland 
            to allocate the necessary £280,000 to fund the second year of the 
            foot-and-mouth recovery plan prepared by Dumfries and Galloway Tourist 
            Board; believes that funds allocated nationally to VisitScotland by 
            the Scottish Executive to help the tourist industry recover from the 
            foot-and-mouth disease outbreak should be targeted on those areas 
            most affected by the disease, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should enter into urgent dialogue with VisitScotland to review their 
            funding allocation to the board in the expectation that the necessary 
            funding will be made available to support the Board's foot-and-mouth 
            recovery plan which has already had considerable success in its first 
            year.</p>

            out from &quot;politically&quot; to end and insert &quot;to this new 
            rail link in early course; recognises that such a commitment should 
            not, of itself, prejudice the future of other Scottish airports, and 
            invites Glasgow's elected representatives to support the provisions 
            of this motion.&quot;</a> </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3062#</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Glasgow Airport 
            Rail Link</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            the importance of Glasgow Airport to the economy of west central Scotland, 
            growing congestion on the M8, M74 and M77, the economic and employment 
            opportunities that would be opened up by establishing a rail link 
            to Glasgow Airport and the urgent need to enhance public transport 
            facilities serving the airport; is concerned at the lack of progress 
            on agreeing and proceeding with this key project, and believes that 
            the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning should 
            convene an urgent meeting of Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority, 
            British Airports Authority, Railtrack, Glasgow City Council, Renfrewshire 
            Council, Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and other interested parties
