<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at</strong> <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5466 Dave Petrie: Support for FSB Report on the Effect of Supermarkets on Town Centres</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the recent Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) report on the effect of supermarkets on existing town centre retailers; notes the report&rsquo;s findings that up to 80% of shoppers now do their food shopping in out-of-town supermarkets and up to 93% of retailers in some towns have experienced negative effects following supermarket development; expresses strong concerns over the significant decline in the level of business activities undertaken by existing retailers and its effect on the local economy; calls on the Scottish Executive to support small and local businesses, which are the backbone of the Scottish economy; believes that the movement away from town centres only increases urban decline and does nothing to tackle the core issue of inner city regeneration; considers that issues concerning town centre planning, parking facilities and traffic congestion need to be addressed to encourage shoppers back into these areas; supports the FSB proposals, including the establishment of a town centre action group and strategy plan to help promote and co-ordinate the delivery of retail and local services in town centres and provide assistance through funding packages; supports locally produced goods and their environmental benefits in terms of food miles and commends supermarkets who pursue a policy based on local production, and considers that supermarkets should be monitored strenuously to ensure that they are competing fairly.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5465 Carolyn Leckie: Bloody Sunday</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament remembers the 28 unarmed civil rights marchers who were slaughtered or wounded by forces of the British state in Derry on Sunday 30 January 1972 and who it considers were slandered by the UK Government and media which falsely claimed that they were armed, including in the official, now discredited, Widgery Report; pays tribute to the survivors and relatives of the dead who have battled courageously for 35 years to establish the truth and are still waiting for the report and conclusions of the Saville Bloody Sunday Inquiry; believes that they have been unfairly scape-goated for the greed of lawyers, causing the inquiry to cost hundreds of millions of pounds, and finally notes that the military personnel who took part in the events of Bloody Sunday were honoured by the Queen which further brings into disrepute the whole honours system.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5464 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> Crofting Reform etc. (Scotland) Bill&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Crofting Reform etc. Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when the meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
<p>Groups 1 to 5:  55 minutes<br />
  Groups 6 and 7:  1 hour 15 minutes<br />
  Groups 8 to 11: 1 hour 35 minutes.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon*</p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5463 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> Rule 10.6.5&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, for the purpose of allowing up to 30 minutes to debate motion S2M-5454 in relation to the draft Local Government Elections Order 2007 on Thursday 25 January 2007, the second and third sentences of Rule 10.6.5 of Standing Orders be suspended.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon*</p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5462 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> Business Motion&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 be completed by 2 March 2007.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon*</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5460 Tommy Sheridan: Solidarity with PCS Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the overwhelming vote in favour of strike action by members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS); offers support to these vital workers in their fight against cuts and compulsory redundancies; condemns the government&rsquo;s lack of assurances on job security, below inflation pay offers, dogmatic privatisation agenda and failure to progress national pay issues, and calls for a moratorium on all civil service redundancies.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5459 Margaret Smith: Queen Margaret University</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, on attaining full university title; acknowledges that Queen Margaret University has become the first new university in Scotland in the 21st century; recognises that Queen Margaret specialises in professional education, development and research that informs policy and practice in health, drama and the creative arts, media and social science, and business and enterprise, and wishes the university all the best in continuing to enrich people&rsquo;s everyday lives.</p>
<p>Supported by: Susan Deacon*</p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5458# Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Autism Parliamentary Network</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament affirms its commitment to improving the lives of people with autistic spectrum disorder; is concerned that, while progress has been made, individuals with autistic spectrum disorder still experience difficulties in accessing the appropriate services and support necessary for them to fulfil their potential, in Aberdeenshire and across Scotland, and welcomes the development of an Autism Parliamentary Network, co-ordinated by the National Autistic Society Scotland, which will serve as an information channel to support Members of the Scottish Parliament in their endeavours to create a society where autism is fully understood and where people with autistic spectrum disorder are fully respected and supported and receive timely, quality services, which are appropriate to their individual needs.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jackie Baillie*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Robin Harper*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*, Dave Petrie*, Derek Brownlee*, Rob Gibson*, Tommy Sheridan*</p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5457 Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Keep Annan Jobs in Annan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision of Young&rsquo;s of Annan to move part of its processing from Dumfries and Galloway to Thailand, at the cost of 120 jobs; considers that the additional food miles involved in sending produce to Thailand and back are environmentally unsustainable, and calls on the Scottish Executive to explore all options to safeguard the future for these workers and the remaining workforce at Young&rsquo;s, by engaging with both the trade unions and management and by ensuring that Scottish Enterprise Dumfries and Galloway is resourced to assist with retraining individuals and developing alternative opportunities in the Annan area.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5456 Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Rescue Package for One Plus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vital contribution that the lone-parent organisation, One Plus, makes in working in partnership in over 100 projects, employing over 600 people, offering advice and support, mainly to women and their children, providing training, employment and care-based services to 1,000 families and individuals every week, while contributing to the regeneration of local communities; notes that the Scottish Executive has rejected a request by One Plus for &pound;2 million to bridge the funding gap which has plunged the organisation into a financial crisis, forcing it into liquidation and meaning the loss of those 600 jobs, childcare services, training and employment facilities; considers that, if the Executive is prepared to give millions of pounds for retraining support to the same number of NCR workers, which may not create a single new job, what is good enough for NCR must be good enough for One Plus and could actually save 600 desperately needed jobs; believes that a rescue package for One Plus makes better economic sense than liquidation, which is estimated to cost up to &pound;10 million in terms of the liquidator&rsquo;s costs, redundancy and severance payments for employees losing their jobs and knock-on impacts, and calls on the Executive to reconsider urgently its decision not to help One Plus out of its financial crisis and to reconvene negotiations with the financial management and the board of One Plus, One Plus&rsquo; main client Glasgow City Council and independent auditors with a view to saving One Plus, a vital service to ten thousand lone parents and their children in Glasgow and the west of Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Frances Curran*, Carolyn Leckie*</p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5455 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> Substitution on Committees&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mr Andrew Arbuckle be appointed to replace Jeremy Purvis as the Scottish Liberal Democrat Party substitute on the Environment and Rural Development Committee.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5451 Donald Gorrie on behalf of the Procedures Committee:</strong> <strong>Parliamentary Time and Scottish Commission for Public Audit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Procedures Committee&rsquo;s 11th Report, 2006 (Session 2), Review of Parliamentary Time (SP Paper 699) and its 10th Report, 2006 (Session 2), Scottish Commission for Public Audit (SP Paper 689), and agrees that the changes to Standing Orders set out in Annexe A to each report be made with effect from the day after the Parliament is dissolved at the end of the current session.</p>
<p>Supported by: Karen Gillon*</p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5450# Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Disabled Access to Shotts Railway Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that all railway stations in Scotland should be fully accessible to people who have a disability; in particular, notes that the east-bound platform at Shotts railway station has no disabled access, which means that wheelchair users currently must use an alternative railway station, and considers that Transport Scotland should provide suitable disabled access to this station as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie*</p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5449 Dr Jean Turner: Baldernock Community Council Takes Climate Change Seriously</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work done by Al Gore&rsquo;s lecture tour and his film &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, which can now be seen on DVD and should be viewed by as many people as possible to bring home the horror of the consequences to communities if they ignore the message of the urgency to halt climate change; praises the Baldernock Community Council for its serious approach to this subject by engaging with a post-graduate student of Salford University who has volunteered his services to analyse the situation within the Baldernock Community Council area over an eight-month period, with a team of local helpers, to find out what energy is used and then to find a way forward to reduce carbon emissions to their lowest; acknowledges that Baldernock is lucky to have the free services of this post-graduate student, and urges the Scottish Executive to encourage all communities to participate in similar exercises, and in so doing join with communities such as Aston Hayes in Cheshire, with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs support, and Riverside in Stirling, by giving some financial support to all community councils for this purpose.</p>
<p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Mr Mark Ruskell*, Robin Harper*, Carolyn Leckie*, Frances Curran*, Rosie Kane*, Donald Gorrie*, Patrick Harvie*, Eleanor Scott*, Mr Jamie Stone*</p>

<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie*</p>
<p> S<strong>2M-5437*#* Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> Television Coverage of Scottish Football<strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should exert all its infl</strong>uence on BBC Scotland to ensure that the corporation provides television coverage of every Scotland national football team match; believes that, in light of the sporting and cultural importance of the national team, this issue should be highlighted every time the Executive meets BBC Scotland, and further believes that members of the public in the west of Scotland would benefit from the matches being shown on terrestrial television.</p>
<p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Donald Gorrie*</p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5339.1 Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5339) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end &quot;but, in so doing, believes that, in order to promote healthy eating and improve the diet of the nation, universal free school meals should be provided for all nursery, primary and secondary school pupils in the public sector, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward appropriate amendments at Stage 2 to this effect.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5339.2 Patrick Harvie: </strong>Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill<strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5339) in the name of Hug</strong>h Henry, insert at end &quot;but, in so doing, regrets that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to review entitlement to free school meals has not yet been acted upon, and considers that a pilot of universal free provision would help inform any decisions resulting from the review.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5339.3 Fiona Hyslop: Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5339) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end &quot;but, in so doing, regrets that provision for the piloting of free and nutritious school meals on a universal basis in public sector nurseries and the early years of primary school has not been included in the Bill, nor the flexibility to introduce this at a later date, as a key element in tackling health and nutrition of children and improving the uptake of school meals in the longer term.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5339.4 Frances Curran: Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5339) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end &quot;and, in so doing, urges the Scottish Executive to consider the crucial research by Hull City Council, announced on 22 January 2007, which shows how free healthy school meals can assist take up and improve learning and behaviour; acknowledges evidence already given to the Communities Committee which supports free healthy school meals, and considers that amendments should be brought forward at Stage 2 which would introduce free healthy school meals for all state school children, including those in nurseries.&quot;</p>
