<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>

  <p> <strong>S3M-1603.2</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson: Housing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1603) in the name of Johann Lamont, after &quot;housing targets&quot; insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s provision of a real terms increase of 9% in affordable housing over the period of the comprehensive spending review falls far short of what is needed to address the affordable housing shortage.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

  <p> <strong>S3M-1601.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Schools of Ambition</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1601) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;and to continue to provide Schools of Ambition funding directly to schools and to support decisions being taken on the expenditure of such funds at school level.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S3M-1601.3</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Schools of Ambition</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1601) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;and considers that head teachers play a crucial role in leading excellent schools and turning around schools that face challenges, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to provide additional support and incentives for head teachers to improve their schools, including enhanced contract terms with more flexibility and increased rewards for outstanding leadership.&quot; </p>
