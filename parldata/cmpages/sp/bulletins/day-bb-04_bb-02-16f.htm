          <p><strong>*S2M-917#</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Parkhead 
            Youth Project</strong>-That the Parliament notes the invaluable contribution 
            that Parkhead Youth Project has made to life in the East End of Glasgow; 
            notes the success of the project in making up to 13,000 contacts with 
            young people each year, offering them advice and support; further 
            notes the recent decision by the East End Social Inclusion Partnership 
            (SIP) to withdraw core funding from the project despite its success 
            in helping young people and the efforts of the staff to attract additional 
            grants; deplores the fact that the project will be forced to close, 
            denying the young people of the East End the opportunity to take part 
            in empowering educational activities; notes that the project has complied 
            with every piece of developmental and organisational advice offered 
            to it by the local SIP; believes that East End SIP should reconsider 
            the decision to withdraw funding from the Parkhead Youth Project, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should take steps to end 
            the funding lottery for community organisations by adopting the principle 
            that funding is guaranteed for all types of social inclusion projects 
            where need has been demonstrated.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-916#</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>Fuel 
            Prices in Rural Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the widening gap between fuel prices in urban and rural areas; further 
            notes that between the fuel crisis in September 2000 and summer 2003 
            the gap remained at a relatively constant two to three pence per litre 
            but has increased since then to a differential of at least six pence 
            per litre, and therefore strongly believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should enter into talks with the major fuel suppliers to ascertain 
            why the differential cannot be maintained at a level that will be 
            less damaging to private, business and tourism interests in rural 
            areas than the current discriminatory level.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-915</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Environmental 
            Justice Fund</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the proposed environmental 
            justice fund and the compensation it proposes for communities blighted 
            by industrial and domestic waste dumping in, or close to, them; regrets 
            the decision of Scottish Ministers to grant planning permission for 
            an extension to the Greengairs landfill site in Lanarkshire, and expresses 
            a desire that the communities in and around the Greengairs site are 
            amongst the first to see real benefit from the proposed fund.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-914#</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> 
            <strong>Better Access to Small Claims Courts</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that the thresholds of £750 for small claims and £1,500 for 
            summary cause are unrealistically low and that these limits are preventing 
            many Scottish citizens from securing the settlement of legitimate 
            claims; notes that the equivalent procedure in England can be used 
            for claims up to the value of £5,000, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should amend the regulations to set more appropriate thresholds 
            for the small claims procedure in Scotland.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-913#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Commonwealth 
            Day 2004</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the valuable role 
            of the Commonwealth in strengthening relationships between nations 
            across the world; welcomes the continued contribution of Scotland 
            and its people to those relationships; reaffirms its support for the 
            work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and commends the 
            theme of Commonwealth Day this year, &quot;Building a Commonwealth 
            of Freedom&quot;, that raises important issues of governance, democracy, 
            human rights, citizenship, building communities and development that 
            are relevant to all peoples of the Commonwealth.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-912</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>British 
            Heart Foundation &quot;How Big is Your Heart&quot; Campaign</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that, despite substantial progress, coronary 
            heart disease remains one of Scotland's biggest killers, causing too 
            many Scots to die prematurely each year; congratulates the British 
            Heart Foundation on its &quot;How Big is Your Heart&quot; Valentine's 
            Day campaign and particularly for the success it has had in raising 
            funds to carry out much-needed research for the fight against heart 
            disease in Scotland; believes that campaigns such as these provide 
            an ideal opportunity to raise public awareness about the nature and 
            extent of the disease, and urges MSPs and members of the public to 
            support the &quot;How Big is Your Heart&quot; campaign.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-911#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Airborne 
            Initiative</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the Scottish Executive's 
            decision to withdraw funding from the Airborne Initiative; commends 
            the staff for the excellent work that they have put in over the last 
            10 years; recognises that the initiative's strategy, in terms of what 
            was possible, has been a huge success in that at least half of the 
            participants completed the course and at least a quarter of these 
            have not reoffended; notes that recent success rates show that up 
            to 50% of those who completed the course have not re-offended; further 
            notes that the scheme has saved the Executive between £2.8 and £4.2 
            million in prison costs over the last 10 years, and believes that 
            the Executive should consider whether it has any other scheme that 
            is likely to be anywhere near as effective in helping serious and 
            persistent offenders back into society and out of prison on a permanent 
            basis.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-910</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Smoking 
            and Fertility</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the British 
            Medical Association (BMA) on its most recent report, <em>Smoking and 
            reproductive life </em>-<em> the impact of smoking on sexual, reproductive 
            and child health</em>; notes with concern the fact that women who 
            smoke are three times more likely to have children with low birth 
            weight and that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, 
            stillbirth and death of the newborn; takes cognisance of the fact 
            that over a quarter of Scottish mothers smoke during pregnancy; asks 
            the Scottish Executive to take on board the remarks made by Dr John 
            Garner, chairman of the BMA Scottish Council, on the fact that the 
            Scottish Executive's target to reduce smoking has not changed despite 
            the release of its recent Tobacco Action Plan, and, in light of these 
            comments, urges the Scottish Executive to set much more ambitious 
            targets for the reduction of smoking in this group.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-909#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Financial 
            Management of Further Education Colleges</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the substantial growth in funding and participation rates in 
            the Scottish further education sector in recent years; recognises 
            the measures initiated by the Scottish Executive and the Scottish 
            Further Education Funding Council aimed at improving the financial 
            health of the sector; notes with concern, however, that the deadline 
            imposed on all colleges to achieve financial security by July 2006 
            puts significant pressure on those colleges who have suffered as a 
            result of mismanagement and/or underfunding in recent decades, and 
            stresses that such financial strategies should not work to compel 
            colleges to cut back on courses or services and should not have a 
            detrimental impact upon current students.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-908</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for the Ay Family Threatened with Imminent Deportation to Turkey</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with grave concern the imminent threat to deport 
            the Ay family from Germany to Turkey and the unusually speedy rejection 
            of their last appeal; further notes the disappearance of Mr Ay on 
            his return to Turkey in 2002 and the fact that he remains missing 
            to this day; cautions the Home Office that failure to note this evidence 
            of danger to the family could lead to their death or similar disappearance 
            and represents a breach of their human rights guaranteed under the 
            United Nations Charter and European Convention on Human Rights; calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to Home 
            Office ministers to intercede immediately on behalf of the Ay family 
            and use their discretionary powers to grant the family leave to return 
            to the UK, and further calls upon the Executive to work with the Home 
            Office to develop an impartial asylum assessment system.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-907#</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> 
            <strong>Fish Farming in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the results of a study into the presence of chemical residues in seabed 
            sediments near fish farms, published by the Scottish Environment Protection 
            Agency (SEPA); notes that 89% of sample measurements did not detect 
            any residues of chemicals used to treat sea lice; further notes that, 
            in the 11% of analysis where there were measurable concentrations 
            of active ingredients, residues were restricted to areas of seabed 
            below and close to fish farms and that all results from outwith these 
            immediate areas were below SEPA's safe environmental standards; welcomes 
            the continuing commitment of the Scottish aquaculture industry to 
            minimising the environmental impact of fish farming, and commends 
            SEPA on its use of sound science, robust regulation and partnership 
            working to ensure the protection of Scotland's marine resources.</P>

            has won the competition on two previous occasions; takes the opportunity 
            to wish the Scottish team of Anna Crosby, Yoosun Koh, Nathan Smeaton, 
            James Moir and Gabriel Brady the very best of luck in attempting to 
            bring the competition back to Scotland for a third time; believes

            believes that the team will do Scotland proud.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-896</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>BBC 
            Highland</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the important role 
            that radio news provides in disseminating regional news and current 
            affairs; regrets that in 1992 the BBC decided to discontinue BBC Highland, 
            the English language news and current affairs service that provided 
            vital regional coverage throughout the Highlands and Islands; notes 
            that the decision was strongly opposed by the wider community at the 
            time, and calls on the BBC, as part of its duty to provide a comprehensive 
            broadcasting service across the whole of the UK, to reinstate the 
            service.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-895#</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Missing 
            Link Completion and Upgrade of the A801 Avon Gorge Road</strong>-That 
            the Parliament acknowledges the tireless campaigning efforts over 
            many decades by local communities and individuals of Westfield and 
            Avonbridge to bring about the much-needed upgrading of the A801 Avon 
            Gorge road; notes with concern the significant number of deaths and 
            accidents on the road over the years; recognises that the road is 
            a key link between the M8 and M9 in the very centre of Scotland and 
            that completion of the missing link part of the road would allow safe 
            and more environmentally responsible north-south transportation in 
            Scotland, avoiding one of the most severe gradients, of approximately 
            1 in 6, of any road in Scotland and so eliminating the 40 miles currently 
            taken by many heavy goods lorries from Whitburn to Grangemouth via 
            Newbridge, and believes that the Scottish Executive should recognise 
            the important national strategic importance of improving this road 
            in considering its decision in relation to planning and should acknowledge 
            its responsibility to help complete and upgrade the road in terms 
            of support for funding to West Lothian and Falkirk councils.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-894#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Bus 
            Services for Holyrood and the New Scottish Parliament</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with dismay the removal of Lothian Buses Service 
            64 running between Holyrood and Princes Street; further notes that 
            the only remaining service, Lothian Buses Service 35 serving the Holyrood 
            and Abbeyhill areas, is a temporary service which does not operate 
            into the evenings; understands that local residents, along with staff 
            from a range of companies including Scotsman Publications, are adversely 
            affected; welcomes plans for the high frequency Lothian Buses Service 
            100 to be extended from the current service from Waverley Station; 
            notes with regret that due to the lack of an agreed route with the 
            Traffic Commissioner there will be no extension of the Lothian Buses 
            Service 100 until autumn 2004 at the earliest; notes with concern 
            the fact that there is now no direct bus route between the city centre 
            and the new Parliament at Holyrood, and considers that the relevant 
            authorities, including the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, 
            the City of Edinburgh Council and Lothian Buses, should resolve this 
            problem urgently.</P>

            that nursery nurses, essential to the development of our children 
            and the future well-being of Scotland's society, are still not valued 
            by COSLA or the Scottish Executive; condemns those who profess to 
            support investment in education and who profess concern about Scotland's 
            depopulation, but condemn nursery nurses to low pay, undervalued status 
            and continued gender discrimination; salutes the determination and 
            solidarity of the 4000 nursery nurses on strike this week; believes 
            that the spectre of all-out strike action is an indictment of the 
            employers, COSLA and the Executive; considers that COSLA should return 
            to the negotiating table; believes that the Executive must exert all 
            its influence to ensure a fair and agreed national settlement for 
            nursery nurses, and affirms its unequivocal support for nursery nurses.</P>

            research into vending machines in schools commissioned by the Food 
            Standards Agency and carried out by the Health Education Trust; notes 
            that this research shows that vending machines containing water, milk 
            and fruit juice are just as popular as those containing fizzy drinks 
            and that they yield a similar income for school funds, and therefore 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should take immediate steps 
            to remove fizzy drinks from vending machines within our schools in 
            favour of these healthy alternatives.</P>

            health charity, fpa, for launching this initiative to help raise awareness

            needs assistance if it is to attract staff to fill its 32% vacancy 
            rate in social work posts and pursue a concerted recruitment campaign; 
            further believes that the council needs to offer a greatly improved 
            pay and conditions package and regrading commitment to prevent staff 
            leaving the profession, and believes that the proposed reorganisation 
            of the department would lower morale further.</P>

            Executive Minister, Sam Galbraith, and the offence caused to older 
            people by his remarks; rejects the assertion that cancer services 
            have suffered because of the decision to fund free personal care; 
            is concerned about the negative impact his comments will have on both 
            older people and cancer patients; is pleased that the policy of free 
            personal care has helped to tackle some of the discrimination towards 
            those with an age-related illness, and believes that this policy has 
            been of huge benefit to many thousands of Scotland's elderly people 
            and one of the most successful achievements of the Scottish Parliament.</P>

            the deal reached at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels

            bad weather on fishing time or time taken for vessels to steam to 
            and from fishing grounds; notes the impact that this will have on 
            the safety of our fishermen at sea, and calls upon Her Majesty's Government
