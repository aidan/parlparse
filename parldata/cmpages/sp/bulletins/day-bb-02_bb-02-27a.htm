            <p><strong>S1M-2597</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder:</strong> 
              <strong>Plight of Chronic Pain Patients</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
              considers that the Scottish Executive and health boards should move 
              the plight of chronic pain patients up the health agenda, chronic 
              pain being regarded as the most neglected health issue in Scotland 
              and possibly the biggest in terms of numbers as, according to the 
              Pain Association Scotland, some 500,000 people suffer long-term 
              pain through problems such as back pain and arthritic conditions, 
              and agrees with health professionals who have appealed to the Parliament 
              that the wreckage of many lives through lost jobs, and the loss 
              of millions of pounds to the economy, could be relieved by ending 
              the dire shortage of specialised pain clinics and staff in Scotland.
