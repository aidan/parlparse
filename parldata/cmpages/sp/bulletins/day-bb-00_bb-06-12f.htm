            that the reduction to five per cent of VAT on the installation of 
            energy saving materials excludes domestic wind turbines, and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to show its commitment to renewable energy 
            by making representations to the UK Government to change this glaring

            the delay in reaching a decision is both unacceptable and is causing 
            substantial uncertainty throughout the Western Isles; further notes

            Change Levy (CCL) is due to be imposed on 1 April 2001 and that this 
            will have a substantial adverse impact on their operating costs and 
            put many businesses in jeopardy; notes that it will affect, in particular, 
            textiles, farming and electronics manufacture in areas such as the 
            Scottish Borders, and urges the Scottish Executive, as a matter of 
            urgency, to review the whole issue of CCL which will penalise even

            the connection between cannabis use and more dangerous and addictive 
            drugs like heroin; further notes that such a measure would effectively 
            take the cannabis market out of housing estates and residential areas 
            and into licensed premises which could be properly regulated; further 
            recognises that such a move would greatly reduce the overall harm

            Parthenon Marbles</strong>-That the Parliament notes the latest request 
            by the Greek Government for the return of the Parthenon Marbles, which 
            were unlawfully taken from Turkish-occupied Athens almost 200 years 
            ago and which are now held by the British Museum in London; rejects 
            claims by the British Museum that they can look after them more effectively 
            than the people of Greece, these being both patronising and also undermined 
            by recent evidence of defective cleaning work carried out by the Museum 
            on the Marbles; believes that, just as the Scots have received back 
            the Stone of Destiny, so the people of Greece have a right to receive 
            back one of their most important artistic and cultural treasures, 
            and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to return the Marbles to their 
            rightful home in Greece. </font></p>

            Announcements made by the Scottish Executive</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees that considerable confusion has been caused by a number of 
            recent Scottish Executive announcements, particularly funding announcements; 
            believes that the way funding announcements are made by the Scottish 
            Executive has done little to further open government; notes that the 
            Executive has allowed the same resources to be announced as &quot;new 
            funding&quot; on more than one occasion, thus damaging public scrutiny, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive to institute a new protocol 
            for all public and press announcements in order that these make clear 
            whether funding announced is additional resources or whether it is 
            part of a previous funding package and, if it is, when and through 
            what statement the funding was previously announced. </font></p>

            Broadcasting of Parliament while in Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the decision of the Parliamentary Bureau to downgrade 
            broadcasting coverage of the Parliament during the period when the 
            Parliament sits in Glasgow; recognises the value of broadcasting coverage 
            in Glasgow as there are fewer spaces in the public gallery there; 
            notes that the decision will create a significant disruption to the 
            continuous picture archive of the Parliament; further notes that the 
            Parliament's own rules of broadcasting coverage cannot be observed 
            with the reduced camera pattern; is concerned that the decision will 
            cause a deterioration in coverage of the Parliament during its important 
            and historic Glasgow sittings; concurs with the unanimous view of 
            Glasgow City Council that this decision gives an unfortunate signal 
            to Glasgow about the way it is considered by the Parliamentary authorities 
            and the Executive, and agrees that the Parliamentary Bureau should 
            reverse its decision. </font></p>

            Lothian provides for disabled people in the community; notes with 
            concern that TAIC is having its funding withdrawn as a result of the 
            recent local government settlement and budget allocations, and agrees 
            that the Executive should conduct an audit to identify the effect

            work of the DPHS in Edinburgh; and believes that the Scottish Executive,

            independent living a reality for all disabled people, in particular 
            by including a disabled audit in the proposed single seller survey,
