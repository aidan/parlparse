<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1833</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Vintage Tractor Run on Behalf of Prostate Cancer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the four builders, Michael Clancy, Geoff Lamb, Ian Snape and Ross King of the Federation of Master Builders for leaving their JCBs behind to take part in a 850-mile vintage tractor run from John O&rsquo;Groats to Land&rsquo;s End to raise money for prostate cancer, a disease that 35,000 men in the United Kingdom are diagnosed with each year and the second most common form of cancer found in men in Scotland; congratulates them on raising &pound;4,000 for The Prostate Cancer Charity; notes that the team will today finish the Scottish part of its journey, and thanks the many companies, organisations, public figures, local farmers and communities for their support and generosity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1832</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Replacing GDP with Wellbeing Indicators</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent research report, produced by Forward Scotland in partnership with the Scottish Council Foundation, entitled <em>A wellbeing framework for Scotland: A better way of measuring society&rsquo;s progress in the 21st Century</em>; notes that the report proposes a range of subjective indicators which could be used as an alternative to GDP; believes that GDP, the current measure of economic growth, makes no distinction between beneficial and harmful economic activity, ignores many socially beneficial and highly desirable practices and treats the depletion of natural capital as income and is therefore a very poor indicator of economic development; further notes that Greens and others across Europe have been calling for alternative indicators to economic growth for many years that focus on wellbeing, and so measure the health, happiness and aspirations of people instead of merely the speed with which their money circulates around the economy, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider alternatives to GDP with a view to adopting more suitable measures of national progress.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1831&diams; </strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>2014: A Year of Sport for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that 2014 will be a significant year for Scottish sport; notes that, in addition to the annual sporting events taking place that year, Scotland will host the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Ryder Cup in Gleneagles; acknowledges that each event will bring international athletes to this country and will focus worldwide attention on Scotland; welcomes the variety of sporting opportunities that 2014 will present to Scotland, and believes that 2014 should be designated &quot;Scotland&rsquo;s Year of Sport&quot; in order to highlight the benefits that sport and physical activity bring to the health and wellbeing of the people of Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1830</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Deaf Awareness Week - 5 to 11 May 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Deaf Awareness Week which is taking place with events throughout Scotland to celebrate the diversity of the deaf community and to highlight the inequalities that deaf, deafblind and deafened people face on a day-to-day basis, and further notes that it will see the launch of the Scottish Council on Deafness&rsquo; research paper, <em>Making the Case for Specialist Mental Health Services for Deaf People in Scotland: with Recommendations for Action</em> that will take place on Thursday 8 May 2008, and highlights the need for equality in the diagnosis, care and treatment of deaf, deafblind, deafened and hard of hearing people with a mental illness in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1829</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Bank of Scotland Senior Shield Winners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Our Lady&rsquo;s High School, Cumbernauld, on its stunning football victory in the Bank of Scotland 105th Senior Shield Cup Final on Tuesday 29 April 2008; notes that this is the first time Our Lady&rsquo;s High has won the century-old trophy; congratulates the S5 and S6 pupils for an enthralling game played in a competitive yet sporting manner at Hampden Park, and thanks pupils, staff and supporters of Our Lady&rsquo;s High for their hard work, enthusiasm and commitment to sport as well as to the local community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1828</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>World Lupus Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that World Lupus Day will take place on 10 May 2008 and that this year the annual Lupus UK conference is being held in Glasgow on 11 May 2008; recognises that around 50,000 people in the United Kingdom and over five million people worldwide, of whom around 90% are female, have lupus and that it is therefore likely that every MSP has a number of constituents who may be affected by this condition; further recognises that, while lupus can be mild, it can also be disabling and sometimes fatal, has no known cure and causes many different symptoms including joint and muscle pain, fatigue, depression and kidney, heart, lung and brain symptoms as well as recurrent miscarriages; acknowledges that there is an urgent need to increase awareness in Scotland, the United Kingdom and worldwide of the debilitating impact of lupus and the difficulty that can arise in gaining a diagnosis, given that it mimics a number of other diseases, and supports Lupus UK and other lupus organisations across the world in calling for increases in funding for medical research on lupus, targeted education programmes for health professionals and public and worldwide recognition of lupus as a significant health issue.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1827</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Inverclyde&rsquo;s Educational Achievements</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and congratulates the first-class efforts and ongoing achievements of Inverclyde school pupils, teachers and parents and Inverclyde Council&rsquo;s Education Department; notes that St Stephen&rsquo;s High School in Port Glasgow has qualified for the final stage of the Schools Question Time Challenge for 2008 for the second year in a row; notes that Inverclyde recently received its best ever primary school HM Inspectorate of Education report for Overton Primary School and Nursery Class, and further notes that in Inverclyde pupil attainment levels regularly exceed the national average and that 50% of Inverclyde pupils go on to further or higher education after leaving school.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1826</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>A New War Memorial for Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the City of Edinburgh Council on its unanimous decision to support the construction of a new memorial in Princes Street Gardens to commemorate all those from Edinburgh who have fallen in war; notes that the first dedicatee will be Corporal Mark Wright GC, who lost his life in Afghanistan in 2006; recognises the courage of our armed services in action today around the world, and believes in the importance of honouring those brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1825</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>National Trust Joins Fight against Plastic Waste</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that the National Trust is set to join other national names, such as B&amp;Q and Marks &amp; Spencer, in deciding to charge 5p for disposable plastic bags in its 220 shops and plant centres; commends the fact that the money raised will go towards conservation work and research into tackling climate change; believes that charging for disposable plastic bags is an excellent way to reduce their use and the subsequent waste that they produce, and calls on other members of the business community to take action to reduce plastic waste.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1824</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Coinage for All Peoples</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Royal Mint to think again with regard to its plans to issue coins using heraldic coats of arms that are exclusively English and condemns it for not including all constituent parts of the UK: Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland and England, on any new issue; draws the attention of the UK Government to the fact that, if these plans go ahead, all legal tender will represent only one nation in the United Kingdom for the first time in history, and therefore demands that the UK Government intervenes to stop this insensitive decision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1823#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Local Newspaper Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 5 to 11 May 2008 is Local Newspaper Week, which this year has the theme of Campaigning for Your Community, showcasing and exploring the campaigning work undertaken by local newspapers across the country; notes that 84% of adults read a local paper, and that local newspapers and their websites are a highly trusted source of news; believes that local newspapers such as the best-selling <em>Falkirk Herald,</em> the <em>Grangemouth Advertiser</em> and the <em>Bo&rsquo;ness Journal</em> are important focal points for their communities, providing a forum for debate on local issues and information and feedback about local events; congratulates the <em>Falkirk Herald </em>on being named Weekly Newspaper of the Year at the 29th Press Awards, organised by the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society; notes that local newspapers, through their editorial content and advertising, play an important role in the local economy; believes that local newspapers are an essential component of local democracy, facilitating the dialogue between elected representatives and their constituents, and applauds the hard work of newspaper staff whose dedication underpins the success of the local newspaper industry.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1799#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Challenging Man&rsquo;s Demand for Prostitution in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the report, <em>Challenging Man&rsquo;s Demand for Prostitution in Scotland</em>, a collaboration between the Women&rsquo;s Support Project in Glasgow and US organisation, Prostitute Research and Education; notes with concern the evidence that men who use prostitutes regularly are more likely to regard other women as &quot;objects&quot; and the link between using prostitutes and sexual violence against women, and believes that the evidence presented in the report will serve to inform and shape the debate and future direction of prostitution in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1799.1</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Challenging Man&rsquo;s Demand for Prostitution in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1799) in the name of Sandra White, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;deplores the publication of the report, <em>Challenging Man&rsquo;s Demand for Prostitution in Scotland</em>, as it lacks any academic merit, is based on material gathered after payments to respondents, is guilty of bias leading to foolish conclusions and presents the public with a simplistic view of a highly complex subject; notes the outrage expressed by 16 distinguished academics who have joined Dr Jane Scoular, Reader in Law at the University of Strathclyde, in utterly condemning the report, and notes that the academics believe that &quot;this research violates fundamental principles of human research ethics in that there is no evidence of any benefit to the population studied&hellip;It seems highly unlikely that the participants were ever informed of the true nature of the research, which could well have influenced their response. This sort of research is dangerous&quot;.&quot;</p>
