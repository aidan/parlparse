          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1972</strong> <STRONG>Dennis Canavan:</STRONG> <STRONG>Congratulations to Falkirk FC</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk Football Club on winning the Bell&rsquo;s League Challenge Cup and commends both Falkirk FC and Ross County FC on providing an excellent and memorable cup final.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1971</strong> <STRONG>Trish Godman:</STRONG> <STRONG>Overcrowding on Scottish Train Services</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament is seriously concerned at the abject failure of ScotRail officials to address the serious problem of gross overcrowding of trains in Scotland and, especially, on the commuter train running from Glasgow to Edinburgh; believes that this cramming of passengers into trains is, at worst, a potential safety hazard of some magnitude and, at best, a source of serious discomfort and stress, especially to elderly and disabled passengers and that it acts as a powerful deterrent to those who would travel on public transport if they could be guaranteed a level of comfort that equals the standards to be found in most European Union member states and Scandinavian countries, and calls on the Scottish Executive to engage in discussions with senior officials of ScotRail in order to enhance the safety and comfort of rail passengers in Scotland.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1970</strong> <STRONG>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</STRONG> <STRONG>The Edinburgh Voluntary and Community Sector Compact</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Edinburgh Compact Strategy; recognises the important role of the voluntary and community sector in Edinburgh and throughout Scotland, and congratulates the Compact Partnership and all the partner agencies who are involved in formulating and implementing the compact strategy.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1969</strong> <STRONG>Christine Grahame:</STRONG> <STRONG>"Wear a Hat Day" (and possibly gloves, coat and scarf)</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes and congratulates Age Concern on its initiative, Wear a Hat Day, on 3 December 2004 to raise funds to publicise, and raise the profile of, the devastating impact of cold weather on the health and well-being of older people; recognises that hypothermia is a silent killer and that older people may not realise how cold they have become until it is too late; while applauding this initiative in fighting the freeze, expresses anger that it is necessary in an energy-rich nation such as Scotland, where the predicted figures for admissions to hospital from hypothermia for the current year for people aged 65 and upwards is 115, the figures for excess winter mortality in the year 2002-03 were 2510, 37% of single pension households, comprising 128,000 households, are classed as fuel poor and Scotland falls well behind the Scandinavian nations in ensuring that winter deaths are minimised; notes the substantial impact rising fuel prices have on those on a fixed income such as a pension, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to enter into discussions with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government with regard to abolishing the means-tested pension credit which 48% of those entitled to claim in Scotland do not claim and which, in any event, is unjust, with a view to providing a pension that will bring an end to pensioner fuel poverty and make &quot;wear a hat&quot; days superfluous.</p>
