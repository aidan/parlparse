          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1834</strong> <strong>Elaine 
            Smith: Employment Rights of Pregnant Women</strong>—That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the recent report by the National Association of 
            Citizens Advice Bureaux which revealed that tens of thousands of women 
            throughout the UK are still being sacked or illegally threatened with 
            dismissal just because they are pregnant and asks that the Scottish 
            Executive considers ways both of sending a message to the Scottish 
            business sector that such practices are not only illegal, but wholly 
            unacceptable in modern Scotland, and of assisting smaller businesses 
            to ensure that they can deliver the additional employment rights being 
            introduced by Her Majesty’s Government.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1833</strong> <strong>Angus 
            MacKay: International Criminal Court (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>—That 
            the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the International Criminal Court (Scotland) Bill, agrees 
            to the expenditure payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund of 
            the expenses of the Scottish Ministers in consequence of the Act.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1832</strong> <strong>Andrew 
            Wilson: Voting Rights for 16-Year-Olds</strong>—That the Parliament recognises 
            that young people are entitled to be treated in a fair, just and consistent 
            manner and are entitled to have the same rights as other citizens; 
            further recognises that adulthood begins at 16 and that young people 
            work, pay tax and have much to contribute to society and politics; 
            notes that the Electoral Reform Society believes that there is a strong 
            body of opinion in favour of votes for 16-year-olds; recalls the First 
            Minister’s opposition to such electoral reform in <i>The Scotsman</i> 
            on 28 January 1998, claiming that there was no demand in the country 
            that had been measured for such a change and that there would be no 
            concessions on this issue; acknowledges and welcomes the support by 
            Nigel Griffiths MP for such a move to lower the voting age to 16; 
            also notes recommendation 167 of the Report of the McIntosh Commission 
            on Local Government and the Scottish Parliament, which asks for particular 
            consideration to be given to the possibility of extending the vote 
            in community council elections to 16-year-olds, as a first step to 
            extending the franchise in all elections to 16-year-olds, and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's 
            Government to promote and support any appropriate amending legislation 
            so that in all future elections people will be able to vote from the 
            age of 16.</font></p>

            John McAllion: Public Interest Whistle-blowing in Scotland</strong>—That 
            the Parliament, while welcoming the presence in Scotland of the independent 
            charity &quot;Public Concerns at Work&quot;, urges the Scottish Executive 
            to take reasonable and proper account of the implications of public 
            interest whistle-blowing for all areas of its work and to promote 
            and deliver openness, accountability and good governance throughout 
            Scotland and further calls upon the Scottish Executive to undertake 
            an education campaign to inform the people of Scotland of the implications, 
            protections and benefits of public interest whistle-blowing as it 
            affects the conduct of public, private and voluntary organisations 
            throughout Scotland.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1830#</strong> <strong>Cathy 
            Jamieson: Commission for Racial Equality</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes 
            the signing by the leaders of all the parties in the Parliament of 
            the Commission for Racial Equality’s compact which condemns the use 
            of race and xenophobia by politicians in the next general election 
            campaign and urges all MSPs to sign this motion to reinforce the commitment 
            to denounce the use of race issues as a means of attracting electoral 
            votes.</font></p>

            Kenny MacAskill: 70th Anniversary of Scottish Youth Hostels Association</strong>—That 
            the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Youth Hostels Association 
            (SYHA) on its 70th anniversary; notes the contribution made by the 
            Association to attracting both visitors to Scotland from abroad and 
            to the Scottish countryside from within; notes also the opportunity 
            provided by the Association to visit many of the more remote but beautiful 
            parts of our land; welcomes the development by the Association of 
            educational tours which facilitate and enhance the opportunity for 
            youngsters in Scotland to partake in the benefits and pleasures of 
            the countryside; recognises the current difficulties being experienced 
            by the SYHA as a result of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, 
            and urges organisations and individuals in Scotland to show their 
            support in this time of difficulty.</font></p>
