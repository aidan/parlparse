<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1220</strong> <strong>Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>The Haven in Blantyre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates The Haven Caring Counselling Communication Centre in Blantyre on being awarded a Life Transitions grant of &pound;283,677; notes that its success in receiving this award recognises the inspirational work done by the centre and the services it provides for people who are affected by life-limiting illnesses in the communities which it serves; commends all the staff of The Haven Caring Counselling Communication Centre for the care and compassion which they give to their clients during the times that they need it most, and notes that this funding will support the continuation of this crucial service for people not only in South Lanarkshire, but also in North Lanarkshire and north Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1219</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Dumbarton Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that, despite the SNP promising to match Labour&rsquo;s school regeneration programme &quot;brick for brick&quot; in April 2007, the young people of Dumbarton have been denied a new much-needed school; believes that Dumbarton Academy should become the first priority for rebuilding in West Dunbartonshire, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene with the local authority to ensure that a new Dumbarton Academy is built by the originally proposed date of Spring 2009 in order that the full curriculum can be delivered.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1218</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Appointment of George Burley as the Scotland National Football Team Manager</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the appointment of Cumnock-born George Burley as the manager of the Scottish national football team; recognises his contribution and achievements as both a player and a manager, and wishes him and the players well in the qualification campaign for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1217</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Commemoration by the Bank of England of the 250th Anniversary of the Birth of Robert Burns</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the outstanding life and work of Scotland&rsquo;s bard, Robert Burns; notes that the man, born in Ayrshire on 25 January 1759 to a Kincardineshire father and an Ayrshire mother, combined his inheritance of Scotland&rsquo;s strong oral and musical traditions with a wide-ranging but restricted formal education; recognises his emergence as a poet through the publication of the <em>Kilmarnock Edition</em> of his poems on 31 July 1786 as a milestone in the development of Scottish culture; notes that, following his death in Dumfries on 21 July 1796, Burns was widely recognised as Scotland&rsquo;s bard, a position he has commanded ever since; acknowledges that, through works such as A Man&rsquo;s A Man for a&rsquo; That and Auld Lang Syne, Burns&rsquo; reputation and influence has spread across the globe, and, recognising the common usage of Bank of England notes in the Scottish economy and the bank&rsquo;s previous commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the death of economist Adam Smith, cordially invites the Bank of England to mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns through the issuing of suitable commemorative notes.</p>
