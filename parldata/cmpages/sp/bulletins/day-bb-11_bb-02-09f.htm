<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7923 Murdo Fraser: Early Intervention in Health and Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of early childhood development and the impact of early intervention in determining future health, social wellbeing and educational achievement of individuals; notes the large and growing body of evidence that highlights the importance of child and parental interaction in the early years of life; recognises the vital role performed by health visitors in supporting families in the early years; notes with concern that, in seven NHS board areas, there was a fall in health visitor numbers between 2009 and 2010; supports a national health visiting strategy that ensures that all families, regardless of income, area or need have access to a health visitor service that will provide a guaranteed level of support to families until their child reaches the age of five; further believes that there needs to be greater flexibility in how parents use their child care entitlement; supports a more flexible mix of state, partnership and private provision of nursery school places, and believes that more information relating to good parenting should be made available to all parents through maternity units, early years settings, GP practices and on NHS websites.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7922 Bill Kidd: Biking for Bobath</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds Julie McElroy for her upcoming Julie&rsquo;s Bobath Challenge to raise funds and awareness for Bobath Scotland Children&rsquo;s Therapy Centre in Glasgow, which supports children with cerebral palsy; further applauds the centre&rsquo;s 16 years of continued service to children diagnosed with cerebral palsy; notes that Julie, age 25, who received therapy from Bobath Centre for her cerebral palsy, will be biking from Edinburgh to Glasgow on 31 March 2011 as the first leg of the challenge; further notes Julie&rsquo;s many adventures to raise awareness and money for cerebral palsy charities across the United Kingdom, including crossing the Amazon Basin and scaling Ben Nevis, and commends Julie&rsquo;s efforts to help children in Scotland, and wishes her best of luck in Julie&rsquo;s Bobath Challenge and any future adventures that she may have to help those with cerebral palsy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7921 Jamie McGrigor: Oban Becomes a University Town</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that Oban has officially become a university town for the first time following the confirmation that the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) Millennium Institute has gained university status; believes that the town&rsquo;s Argyll College Oban campus and the Scottish Association for Marine Science Scottish Marine Institute are key parts of the UHI infrastructure and offer a very high quality of education to students, with excellent staff and a diverse range of courses; further believes that university status will boost the academic standing of the UHI and attract more students from across Scotland and further afield, and wishes all current and future students and staff in Oban and all other parts of the UHI network every success in the future.</p>

<p><em>followed by</em> SPCB Motion: Technical Changes to the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7912 Bill Wilson: The Bush Torture Indictment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Preliminary Bush Torture Indictment, which could serve as a basis on which to prepare country and plaintiff-specific indictments against George W Bush for condoning the use of torture in the form of waterboarding; notes that, according to international law experts at the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights and the Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, former presidents do not enjoy special immunity under the Convention Against Torture; believes that, as the UK has reportedly used information obtained from this torture, its leaders are also complicit and should face similar indictment, and is of the opinion that it is particularly important for countries claiming to believe in democracy and human rights to ensure that their nationals do not take part in, or condone, torture in any form.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7910 Linda Fabiani: South Lanarkshire College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates South Lanarkshire College on its excellent recent HMIE report, which reported that the inspectorate had full confidence in the college as well as noting six examples of excellent practice or sector-leading and innovative practice and not a single main point for action, and praises the students and staff of the college for their work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7736 Mike Pringle on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body: Technical Changes to the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(a) in exercise of the powers conferred by section 3 of the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Act 2009 (asp 1) (the &quot;2009 Act&quot;) determines that with effect from the day after the day this resolution is made the Scottish Parliamentary Pension Scheme (within the meaning of section 4 of the 2009 Act) is modified in accordance with Annex 1 to this resolution, and</p>
