              <p><strong>S2M-553</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>European 
                Parliament Seat Numbers</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
                reduction of UK seats in the European Parliament from 87 to 78 
                to accommodate enlargement of the EU; welcomes the accession of 
                10 new countries in 2004; believes, however, that Scotland, with 
                no seat on the Council of Europe, no Commissioners and fewer MEPs 
                than comparably-sized independent member states, has little enough 
                influence in the EU, and therefore believes that the Scottish 
                Executive should resist the reduction in Scotland's MEPs from 
                eight to seven. </P>
