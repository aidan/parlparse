<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5406&diams; </strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender History Month</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that February is LGBT History Month and that events will be taking place around Scotland to celebrate the lives of Scottish LGBT people, past and present; congratulates the many organisations that have contributed to LGBT History Month, including voluntary organisations, religious groups, businesses and the Scottish Executive; regrets that LGBT history, from the horrors of the gulags and gas chambers to the achievements of LGBT people in all spheres of life, often remains unwritten and unspoken; believes that this represents a cultural loss to the whole of society; further believes that young LGBT people in particular have a right to learn about their cultural heritage in all its forms, and hopes therefore that many communities, including schools, will participate in LGBT History Month this year and in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5405</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Scotland Sends Congratulations to Bulgaria and Romania on Joining the European Union</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament extends a warm hand of friendship to Bulgaria and Romania in celebration of their joining the European Union from the beginning of January this year, noting the celtic connections between Bulgaria and Scotland in particular; recognises, at the same time, the challenges that we share being on the periphery of the European Union; hopes that we can make common endeavour to ensure that the voices of our people are collectively at the heart of policy-making discussion in the EU, and looks forward to sharing experience, knowledge and development between the people of our countries.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5404</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Preserve and Celebrate the Donald Dewar Room</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament invites the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) to consider that there is a great variety of visitors from home and abroad to the Scottish Parliament who regard their visit to the Donald Dewar Room, with its unique collection of books and memorabilia which belonged to Scotland&rsquo;s first First Minister, as one of the highlights of their visit; encourages the SPCB to ensure that this room continues to be accessible at all times to visitors through prior arrangement with the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, currently the custodian of the key for the room, and finally celebrates the fact that the SPCB has facilitated provision of a wide variety of meeting and work rooms that can be booked by any parliamentarian or member of staff for quiet times of reflection or wider meetings with people from all across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5403</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Close Guantanamo Bay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that today, Thursday 11 January 2007, marks the fifth anniversary of the arrival of the first prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, the US-run detention and prison camp in Cuba; further notes that around 400 individuals are still detained in Guantanamo Bay prison camp without charges being laid against them and that many have been detained for years without charges or access to legal representation; believes that Guantanamo Bay prison camp represents an affront to democracy and a cruel abuse of human rights which further fuels the sense of hatred, injustice and inequality which often leads to acts of individual terrorism rather than being a useful tool in any way, shape or form against terrorism; believes that Guantanamo Bay represents a form of state terrorism by the United States of America and that it should be closed immediately with all individuals improperly detained entitled to hear charges brought against them with proper legal representation or be released; welcomes the screening of the documentary &quot;Outlawed - Torture, Extraordinary Rendition and Disappearances in the &quot;War on Terror&quot;&quot; in Committee Room 3 today, 11 January 2007, at 12:30 pm, and applauds the role of the American Civil Liberties Union in promoting this documentary.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5402</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Condolences to Family of David Ervine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its sincerest condolences to the family of David Ervine, the Progressive Unionist Party leader in Northern Ireland, who died suddenly on Monday 8 January 2007 aged only 53; pays tribute to the contribution that David Ervine made to the ongoing peace process in Northern Ireland, and believes that he will be sorely missed in Belfast and across Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5401</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Hospitals Need More Capacity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that Wishaw General Hospital was forced to close to accident and emergency admissions due to lack of capacity and that neighbouring hospitals were placed under increased pressure; notes that other NHS board areas are also at full capacity, often causing long waits on trolleys and multiple transfers between departments for some patients; believes that, with an increasing elderly, dependent and sick population, NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s plans to close emergency services and acute admissions at Monklands Hospital are inherently flawed, when experience demonstrates that an increase in capacity is needed, not a decrease; further believes that the burden of servicing two major PFI projects at a cost of &pound;42.7 million in 2006-07, the second biggest spend on PFI in Scotland, compromises NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s ability to organise services in the interests of patients and communities, and considers that the lack of capacity is compromising quality of care for patients and that a proper needs assessment of capacity and the resources to deliver that capacity is urgently required.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5400</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Covenanters&rsquo; Field, Bothwell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by South Lanarkshire Council to allow house building on the last remnant of the battlefield of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679, known as Covenanters&rsquo; Field, which has been left virtually undisturbed for 327 years; further notes that Covenanters&rsquo; Field was given to the local authority by the Battle of Bothwell Bridge Commemoration Service Committee in the 1980s to be held for safekeeping and protection; welcomes the proposal put forward by Bothwell Community Council to relocate the Covenanters&rsquo; Monument to the field, to establish a garden of remembrance and to develop the field as a tourist attraction by creating a &quot;Covenanters&rsquo; Trail&quot; to commence at the field and follow the Clyde Valley through Dalserf Church and onwards to some of the other Covenanters&rsquo; sites, and calls on the local authority to reconsider its proposals in light of the historic importance and local community opposition to the development of the Covenanters&rsquo; Field.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5399</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Further Education and Training Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the Further Education and Training Bill, introduced in the House of Lords on 20 November 2006, relating to the devolved matters of training and employment, to&nbsp;alter the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers in respect of services to share information and assistance in relation to employment and training, and in respect of industrial training levies, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5398</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the principle of giving consumers an effective voice as set out in the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill, introduced in the House of Lords on 16&nbsp;November 2006, and agrees that the relevant provisions to achieve this end in the Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5394</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Climate Change Kills the Poor - Legal Change Can Make a Difference</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the latest statement from Tony Blair regarding air travel and climate change; notes that since Labour came to power the United Kingdom&rsquo;s carbon emissions have increased by around 5%; notes that it is the poor of the world who will suffer most as climate change increases; also notes that diseases, including malaria and diarrhoea, will increase so that 185 million people in Africa alone could die as a direct result by 2100; recognises that droughts will worsen as water supplies for one sixth of the world&rsquo;s population are at risk from glaciers melting, increasing the frequency and intensity of famines; further notes that flooding as a result of the rise in sea level will threaten 300 million people within decades, creating between 150 and 200 million environmental refugees; acknowledges that rich countries are responsible for 80% of the man-made increases in CO<sub>2 </sub>; recognises that the average UK citizen causes in two and a half days as much CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions as a Malawian does in a year, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on the Westminster Government to ensure that the proposed climate change legislation has legally binding annual targets which include all aviation emissions.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5389.2</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Health with specific reference to Accident and Emergency Unit Provision</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5389) in the name of Mrs Nanette Milne, insert at end&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;particularly in the light of recent events at Wishaw General Hospital which&nbsp;was forced to close its doors to all but the most severe emergency cases.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5389.3</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Health with specific reference to Accident and Emergency Unit Provision</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5389) in the name of Mrs Nanette Milne, leave out from &quot;does not&quot; to end and insert &quot;reaffirms its view that Delivering for Health provides a coherent and consensual basis for service change in NHS Scotland; notes the support expressed in previous debates by Members from across the Parliament and health stakeholders for key aspects of the policy, including promoting local access to services and balancing local delivery with the need to have centres of excellence that provide high-quality, modern, specialist care, focusing on primary care services, separating scheduled and unscheduled care and providing community casualty units; commends the progress being made to implement the key directions set out in Delivering for Health; supports the unparalleled investment in health and health improvement made by the Scottish Executive; welcomes the requirement for investment in primary care and in community casualty services before changes are made to existing accident and emergency services; commends the hard work and outstanding commitment of NHS staff to new and flexible ways of working needed to provide modern and responsive services; supports the principle of a modern, well-resourced NHS in Scotland, free at the point of need, and believes that any necessary changes in the NHS in Scotland should be based on the needs of local communities.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5386.1</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Education with specific reference to Skills Academies</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5386) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;along the lines&quot; to end and insert &quot;in an education setting that offers a broad and balanced curriculum and equality of opportunity for all; believes that in order for all our young people to reach their full potential it is essential that class sizes be reduced to no more than 20 and, for composite and practical classes, to no more than 15, and further believes that segregation of pupils is inappropriate and that the proposals for skills academies are a diversion which will narrow opportunities rather than broadening them.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5386.2</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Education with specific reference to Skills Academies</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5386) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;for many children&quot; to end and insert &quot;most political parties have recognised the need for more vocational experiences for pupils over 14 since 2003 and is concerned about lack of progress in providing this to date; agrees with the position of the Schools and Colleges Review and the Parliament&rsquo;s Education Committee in its recent Pupil Motivation inquiry that all children should have vocational opportunities and that these should not be restricted by assessment of academic ability at the age of 14; acknowledges that the real challenge is to provide opportunities and choice for all pupils, working together with schools and colleges, and notes the concerns of skills and trades organisations that the proposal for skills academies provided for pupils with lack of academic ability, as proposed recently by the First Minister, is not what is required by them to meet current and future skills demand.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5386.3</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Education with specific reference to Skills Academies</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5386) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;be they stand-alone&quot; to end and insert &quot;but believes that investment in extending access to vocational skills should first be delivered at a local level throughout Scotland before considering the advisability of investing in dedicated institutions outwith the comprehensive system.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5386.4</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Education with specific reference to Skills Academies</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5386) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the priority given to improving education standards by the Scottish Executive, local authorities, schools and other partners; recognises that the Executive&rsquo;s investment in new and refurbished schools, increased teacher numbers, reducing class sizes, strong parental involvement and stable industrial relations is providing the right environment for real and lasting change for Scotland&rsquo;s children; welcomes the new opportunities that are being developed through A Curriculum for Excellence and Determined to Succeed, including enabling young people across Scotland aged 14 to 16 to undertake vocational learning in further education colleges as part of the school-based curriculum; believes that a strong and relevant education system is fundamental to securing a smart, successful Scotland in which all our 16 to 19 year-olds are in education, employment or training, and calls for steadily improving opportunities for young people to achieve success in education including, particularly, opportunities to study a wider range of vocational options.&quot;</p>
