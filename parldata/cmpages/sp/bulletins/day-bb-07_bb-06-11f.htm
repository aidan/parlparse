<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-149&diams; </strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Food in the Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the high quality of food grown and produced in Scotland; notes the nutritional value of quality, local fresh produce and the environmental benefits of reducing transport costs; recognises the huge importance of food production to the rural economy in the south of Scotland and across Scotland; notes that it is vital for small producers to be encouraged to bid for public sector contracts; recognises the importance of effective marketing and branding in ensuring a sustainable future for Scottish producers; notes the success of Bord Bia, Ireland&rsquo;s food board; considers that Scotland should have its own similar Scottish food and drink promotion and marketing board, and believes that a Scottish Food in the Parliament event, similar to the annual Business in the Parliament event, should be held in the Parliament to showcase Scottish produce and to improve the dialogue between all sections of the food industry and the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-148</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Cumbernauld Farmers&rsquo; Market</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Lanarkshire Farmers&rsquo; Market held its first market in Cumbernauld on 8 June 2007; further notes the great success of this event; congratulates the organisers of the market and those who worked to bring it to Cumbernauld; looks forward to the market&rsquo;s return to the town in future; wishes those participating traders all the best, and hopes that the market will go from success to success with Cumbernauld becoming a permanent fixture on its calendar.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-147&diams; </strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>National Diabetes Week, 10 to 16 June 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Small Change, Big Difference campaign being run by Diabetes UK Scotland for National Diabetes Week 2007; commends the tremendous support that Diabetes UK Scotland gives to the estimated 173,000 people in Scotland who are living with diabetes; notes that, in the Highlands alone, the number of people living with diabetes stands at 11,111 and this figure is predicted to rise to at least 13,000 by 2017, and therefore considers that the Scottish Diabetes Framework Action Plan should be delivered by 2009, as set out in the Diabetes UK Scotland Manifesto 2007.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-146</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>2010 Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament entreats all Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty signatories to make every endeavour to ensure that the preparatory committee for the 2010 review conference is afforded full support in its principal aims of facilitating and making recommendations in respect of the treaty, which is regarded as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and is designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to further the goal of nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament and to promote co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy; considers it appropriate for Scotland to be accorded observer status to the committee in view of the precedent set by Palestine and the fact that Britain&rsquo;s nuclear deterrent, the Trident missile system, is stationed in Scotland, and encourages the Scottish Executive to consider what course of action could be taken to achieve this end.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-145</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Memorandum of Understanding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deprecates the action taken by the Prime Minister in signing an agreement of understanding with Libya regarding the transfer of prisoners without prior consultation with the Scottish government, as set out in the Memorandum of Understanding and Supplementary Agreements between the UK Government and the Scottish Ministers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-144</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Orkney and Shetland Junior Inter-County</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the junior inter-county associations from both Orkney and Shetland on the occasion of their 60th anniversary; recognises the very positive impact that the inter-county competition has had in developing sporting achievement among young people in the islands; welcomes the opportunities that it has provided for building ties and friendships between the communities in both Orkney and Shetland, and applauds the tremendous efforts of the many volunteers over the years who have done so much to make the Stuart Cup not only possible but a continuing success.</p>
