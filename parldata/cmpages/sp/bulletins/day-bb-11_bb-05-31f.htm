<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong><br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;<br />
        <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong><br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong><br />
      <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00139 Alison Johnstone: EU Consultation on Plastic Bags and Packaging</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the European Commission&rsquo;s consultation on options to reduce the use of plastic carrier bags and improve the requirements of the biodegradability of packaging; understands that up to 450 billion plastic bags and sacks are consumed yearly in the European Union, contributing to the litter stream, polluting oceans, soil and other waterways and seriously injuring wildlife; further understands that the total volume of plastic carrier bags produced in Europe in 2008 was 3.4 million tonnes and that the low individual weight and small size of plastic bags means that they often escape waste management and end up in the marine environment, where their eventual decay can take hundreds of years; considers that advertising a packaging product as biodegradable when it will not, in fact, biodegrade in natural conditions can be misleading; recognises what it considers the positive step by the City of Edinburgh Council, which is currently investigating how a reusable bonus bag scheme can be rolled out across the city; considers that such steps are essential in a zero-waste society, saving resources, cutting CO2 emissions and reducing local authorities&rsquo; landfill tax bills and that the EC consultation provides an opportunity for an international solution to this global problem, and calls on the Scottish Government to encourage individuals and organisations to respond to the consultation at:</p>
<p>http://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/plasticbags_en.htm before 9 August 2011.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00138 Neil Findlay: Staff Thanks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends all of the staff working at the Parliament; thanks them for their approachability, responsiveness, professionalism and the help provided to the members, especially the new members, and considers their conduct in carrying out their duties exemplary.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00137 Bob Doris: Glasgow Welcomes Big Lottery Money</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Big Lottery Fund has allocated resources of &pound;1,212,845 to 54 projects in the Glasgow region during May 2011; notes that the Big Lottery Fund, along with the small grants schemes, Awards for All, Investing in Ideas and 2014 Communities, is investing in Scotland&rsquo;s communities through its Investing in Communities portfolio; considers that groups across Maryhill, Springburn and Rutherglen such as The Dash Club, Cambuslang and Rutherglen Creative Arts Group, Carers Care, St Roch&rsquo;s Secondary School, Scaraway Nursery, Cambuslang Summerfest Committee, Playbusters Ltd and Toonspeak Young People&rsquo;s Centre have benefited immensely and that this funding will be a welcome boost to all 54 projects, and wishes them all every success for the future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd, Sandra White, Mike MacKenzie, Mark McDonald</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00094 Patrick Harvie: Glasgow&rsquo;s Egyptian Halls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the cultural value of Glasgow&rsquo;s Egyptian Halls, a Grade A listed building designed by Alexander &quot;Greek&quot; Thomson, which is recognised as an architectural treasure of the city; deeply regrets the loss and dilapidation of other Greek Thomson buildings over the years, such as Caledonia Road Free Church; is concerned that the current owner of the Egyptian Halls is seeking permission to demolish the building, which it considers would deprive Glasgow of yet another part of its architectural heritage; considers that the owner of a culturally significant building bears a special responsibility for its protection and restoration and that this responsibility cannot be divorced from the benefits of ownership; calls on Glasgow City Council to refuse permission to demolish the Egyptian Halls and on the owner of the halls to work with the council and others to fully restore the building, and thanks the Greek Thomson Society for its work over many years in protecting and promoting Thomson&rsquo;s life and work.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00092 Bob Doris: Maryhill Parish Church Spring Fayre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Maryhill Parish Church on what is considered a highly successful Spring Fayre on Saturday 21 May 2011; considers that the church has a role as a leading light in family, youth and community initiatives in the area and that Deacon Jim Hamilton and the Rev Stuart Matthews have made a considerable contribution, and wishes Maryhill Parish Church well in its efforts to further engage with the local community in the years ahead.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00088 Drew Smith: Southside Festival 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament marks the occasion of the 4th annual Southside Festival, which takes place on 28 May 2011 in the Queen&rsquo;s Park Recreation Ground in Glasgow; notes that last year&rsquo;s festival attracted 15,000 visitors and that this year&rsquo;s event features a wealth of opportunities for Southsiders to enjoy music, art, comedy, talks and other events including community stalls over the period of the festival; further notes that the Southside Film Festival took place between 13 and 15 May; congratulates the organisers, stewards and other volunteers, and sends best wishes for the success of this year&rsquo;s festival, which it hopes will be repeated for many years to come.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00088.1 James Dornan: Southside Festival 2011</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00088 in the name of Drew Smith (Southside Festival 2011), leave out from second &quot;which&quot; to end and insert &quot;and hopes that what it considers the extraordinary decision by Glasgow City Council to withdraw &pound;11,000 of funding, which it believes is putting at risk the future of the Southside Festival, will be reconsidered by the Labour administration in Glasgow to help ensure that the festival will be repeated for many years to come.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S4M-00087# Liam McArthur: Damaging Impact of Air Discount Scheme Changes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the benefits that the Air Discount Scheme has brought to Scotland&rsquo;s island communities since it was first introduced in 2006; considers that, even with the Air Discount Scheme reduction, the cost of flying to and from the islands imposes a considerable financial burden on island life; understands, therefore, the very real concerns that the exclusion of business travel from the Air Discount Scheme has caused to businesses as well as to the public and voluntary sectors in the islands; considers that the change, on which there was no prior consultation, means that businesses and other organisations now either have to face even higher travel costs or have to miss out on opportunities to take part in meetings and other events on the Scottish mainland and further afield, and would welcome an urgent review of the impact of the exclusion of business travel.</p>
<p>Supported by: Tavish Scott, Jim Hume, Mary Scanlon</p>
<p><strong>S4M-00086 Bob Doris: Glee Meets Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow&rsquo;s North United Communities Theatre Group on what is considered its hugely successful first major drama production based on music from the musical drama TV series, Glee, on 20 and 21 May 2011 in the Wyndford Hub; notes that the show is being co-produced by Depot Arts and performed by young people from communities across the north of Glasgow including Ruchill, Cadder, Wyndford and Possilpark; thanks everyone involved in the production, particularly the youngsters who demonstrated such commitment to the show by their excellent performances, by designing and building stage sets, and managing the show&rsquo;s sound and lighting, and believes that such initiatives help to break down long-standing territorial boundaries and bring communities closer together.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00084 Neil Bibby: Gryffe High Goes Fairtrade</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament extends its warmest congratulations to the staff, students and parents of Gryffe High School on being officially recognised as a Fairtrade School; applauds the work done by all at Gryffe High School to promote ethical trading and thereby support some of the world&rsquo;s poorest farmers, and believes that this is an important step on the road to achieving fairtrade status for even more communities across Renfrewshire, where it considers that fairtrade groups have done outstanding work to promote ethical trading throughout Renfrewshire.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00083 Stuart McMillan: Cuts to Welfare Spending </strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern plans by the UK Government to cut &pound;9 billion from the benefits budget over the Comprehensive Spending Review period, including over &pound;2 billion from Disability Living Allowance and over &pound;1 billion from Employment and Support Allowance; considers that these cuts will have a direct affect on many disabled people in Scotland, potentially depriving tens of thousands of vital financial support to meet the extra costs that they face and to support them as they prepare for work; acknowledges the views of RNIB Scotland that this will disproportionately affect the chances of disabled people, including people with sight loss, to lead independent lives, and therefore urges the UK Government to review the savings to be delivered by measures contained in the Welfare Reform Bill and maintain essential support for blind, partially-sighted and other disabled people.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00082 Kenneth Gibson: No Necessity for a Coal-fired Power Station at Hunterston</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Draft Electricity Generation Policy Statement 2010, which made it clear that the Scottish Government is &quot;committed to decarbonising electricity generation by 2030&quot;; acknowledges that the SNP manifesto stated that &quot;the policy statement also makes clear that increased renewable generation means we see no energy need for additional thermal generation plants&quot;; considers that the current proposal for a coal-fired power station at Hunterston is, in effect, for new coal generation and would destroy a valuable site of special scientific interest and impact adversely on the local environment, tourism and the local quality of life; notes the opposition from local communities, thousands of individuals and a broad range of environment and development organisations to the application; expresses concern that the UK Government has submitted Hunterston for New Entrants Reserve 300 funding to the European Investment Bank despite a majority of MSPs in the last session opposing the proposal, and believes that proposals put forward that do not create additional greenhouse gas emissions are more deserving of funding.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00082.1 Liam McArthur: No Necessity for a Coal-fired Power Station at Hunterston</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00082 in the name of Kenneth Gibson (No Necessity for a Coal-fired Power Station at Hunterston), leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that approval for the project is the responsibility of the Scottish Government under Scotland&rsquo;s planning powers; believes, therefore, that the UK Government was right to submit all the bids that it received for New Entrants Reserve 300 funding to the European Investment Bank rather than making a unilateral decision on Scottish bids on behalf of the new Scottish administration, and trusts that, in light of the SNP&rsquo;s 2011 manifesto, planning permission for a new coal-fired power station at Hunterston will not be granted.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S4M-00081 John Mason: Full Steam ahead on the New Glasgow to Edinburgh Rail Link</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recently increased service on the Helensburgh to Edinburgh rail line via Glasgow, Airdrie and Bathgate, which serves many towns in central Scotland, and welcomes the continued development of this service, which it considers to be proof of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to transport and, in particular, public transport projects.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00080 Liz Smith: ASDA Kwik Cricket Competition Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the 2011 ASDA Kwik Cricket competition for primary schools; considers kwik cricket to be a great way to get children active and to introduce them to one of Scotland&rsquo;s fastest growing sports; recognises that 5,000 children participated in the competition last year and hopes that that number will grow in 2011; notes that the Scotland final takes place at Perth&rsquo;s Doo&rsquo;cot Park on 14 June and that the winners will represent Scotland at the UK final at Derbyshire County Cricket Club on 20 July, and commends the continued support of ASDA and Cricket Scotland in developing the game across the country.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00079 Jackie Baillie: &quot;Spokes&quot; Person against School Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the dedication shown by Somerset Charrington in campaigning against proposals to close primary schools in Argyll and Bute; understands that the Ulva parent has been cycling around Argyll and Bute, visiting all of the rural schools currently under threat of closure, bringing good luck messages from across the local authority; notes that Mr Charrington completed his mammoth journey on 21 May 2011 when he arrived at Luss Primary to be greeted by pupils and parents, and calls on Argyll and Bute Council once again to reconsider its plans for school closures.</p>
