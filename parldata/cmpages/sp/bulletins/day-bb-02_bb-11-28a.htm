Parliament</STRONG></P><DIR> <P>9:30 am&#9;Debate on Education&#151; </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3650</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Education</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
believes that the Scottish education system should move to the post-comprehensive 
era, where schools keep the comprehensive principle of equality of opportunity 
but are opened up to new and different ways of education built round the needs 
of the individual child and where there is a greater range of specialist schools 
for parents to choose from, offering excellent routes into university and skilled 
employment</P><DIR> <DIR> <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following 
amendments</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3650.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Cathy Jamieson: Education</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3650) in the name of Mr Brian Monteith, leave out 
from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the distinctive 
nature of Scottish education; supports reforms designed to tackle underperformance 
in schools and ensure that every school is a centre of excellence; recognises 
the major investment being made by the Scottish Executive; supports local flexibility 
and innovation in schools; welcomes the increased emphasis on citizenship, enterprise 
and vocational education; acknowledges the importance of a strong partnership 
with education authorities, schools, teachers and parents in raising attainment 
and closing the opportunity gap, and supports the Executive in its determination 
to ensure every child has an education that meets his or her individual needs.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3650.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Michael Russell: Education</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3650) 
in the name of Mr Brian Monteith, leave out from &quot;should&quot; to end and 
insert &quot;must be one which delivers the best for each child, is founded upon 
the broad and inclusive traditional strengths of Scottish education, is resourced 
and organised to help young people gain a secure grounding in the basic skills 
at an early age, gives various routes for entry into further education or skilled 
employment and which welcomes diversity and a variety of local delivery within 
a strong state sector, and therefore rejects any attempt to bring back from the 
political grave the divisive Tory educational philosophies of the past which proved 
so damaging to Scotland&#146;s young people during 18 years of undemocratic and 
unwanted Conservative Government in this country.&quot; </P></DIR></DIR><P>followed 
by&#9;Debate on Drugs Courts&#151; </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3641</STRONG> <STRONG>Bill 
Aitken:</STRONG> <STRONG>Drugs Courts</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
the growing prevalence of drug abuse and drug-related crimes; regrets that the 
Scottish Executive continues to send out mixed messages on drugs; further regrets 
that the Executive&#146;s flagship drugs courts have become a means of avoiding 
a prison term, and therefore calls on the Executive to ensure that (a) those sent 
to drugs courts have committed only a minimal number of offences, (b) there are 
sufficient resources to ensure that those who are sentenced by drugs courts have 
the option of immediate and instant treatment to undergo rehabilitation and (c) 
any breach of orders from the drugs courts are dealt with properly.</P><DIR> <DIR> 
<P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3641.2</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace: Drugs Courts</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3641) 
in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert 
&quot;welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Executive to address the problem 
of drug misusing offenders by establishing pilot drugs courts, the success of 
Drugs Treatment and Testing Orders and the Scottish Drugs Enforcement Agency, 
the additional resources made available to agencies within the criminal justice 
system, local authorities and the NHS to support its co-ordinated approach to 
reducing or eliminating the dependence on or propensity to misuse drugs and its 
integrated strategy to tackling drug-related crime and reducing the impact which 
this has on communities.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3641.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Roseanna 
Cunningham: Drugs Courts</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3641) in 
the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from &quot;regrets&quot; to end and insert 
&quot;welcomes the work of the drug courts in diverting users into effective rehabilitation 
programmes; acknowledges the dedication of the fiscals, social workers, drugs 
counsellors and sheriffs who have worked to make the drugs courts successful; 
considers that further resources are required to ensure the continued effectiveness 
of the drugs courts, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure the early roll-out 
of drugs courts and the provision of the necessary resources so that offenders 
in all areas of Scotland will have equal access to the same rehabilitation opportunities.&quot;
