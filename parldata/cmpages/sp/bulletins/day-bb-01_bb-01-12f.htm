            the Parliament notes with concern uncertainty about the future of 
            the creameries in Campbeltown, Rothesay and Arran; further notes the 
            claims of Scottish Milk that the cost of compliance with the Urban 
            Waste Water Directive may force them to pass on these costs, net of 
            grant, to local dairy farmers in Campbeltown, Rothesay and Arran; 
            welcomes the commitment by the Rural Development Minister to support 
            these creameries, and urges Scottish Milk to spread the cost of compliance 
            across its Scottish produce base and to match any funding given by 
            the Executive to the creameries.</font></p>

            or &quot;Scottish government&quot; in ordinary discussion when describing 
            the administration led by Henry McLeish and Jim Wallace, and notes

            <strong>Andrew Wilson: Burns Memorial Hall, Kilsyth</strong>—That the Parliament 
            notes with concern North Lanarkshire Council's decision to demolish 
            the Burns Memorial Hall in Kilsyth; further notes the historic contribution 
            of William Chalmers Burns in his missionary work, and calls upon the 
            council to reconsider its decision and to use the Hall to mark this 
            man's remarkable life in an appropriate manner.</font></p>

            <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Rankin Maternity Unit, Inverclyde Royal Hospital</strong>—That 
            the Parliament notes with great regret the possible closure of the 
            Rankin Maternity Unit at Inverclyde Royal Hospital and notes that, 
            as Inverclyde already has one of the worst health records in Britain, 
            any closure can only exacerbate this situation; further notes that 
            in particular the loss of specialised local knowledge which staff 
            have built up over many years would be a devastating blow to the community, 
            while the long and expensive journeys for women and families to the 
            proposed unit in Paisley would put unbearable strain on them at an 
            already stressful time, with potential consequences for their unborn 
            children; further regards it as inconceivable that an area the size 
            of Inverclyde would be left without any maternity service, and therefore 
            fully supports the campaign to Save the Rankin in Inverclyde with 
            the aim of keeping vital services and jobs in the community and supporting 
            staff who provide the high standard of health provision to users of 
            the Rankin Maternity Unit.</font></p>

            of people in residential care and nursing homes with preserved rights 
            to higher levels of income support as set out in the Health and Social

            professionals for the purposes of dispensing NHS prescriptions written 
            by them and of determining the list of medicines and appliances which 
            they may prescribe and which NHS community pharmacists may be paid

            with incredulity the hysterical reaction of some Westminster politicians 
            to this issue; regrets that the SNP are more concerned with the shadow
