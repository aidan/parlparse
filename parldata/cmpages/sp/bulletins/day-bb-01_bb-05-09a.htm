                        the Scottish Youth Hostels Association (SYHA) on its 70th 
                        anniversary; notes the contribution made by the Association 
                        to attracting both visitors to Scotland from abroad and 
                        to the Scottish countryside from within; notes also the 
                        opportunity provided by the Association to visit many 
                        of the more remote but beautiful parts of our land; welcomes 
                        the development by the Association of educational tours 
                        which facilitate and enhance the opportunity for youngsters 
                        in Scotland to partake in the benefits and pleasures of 
                        the countryside; recognises the current difficulties being 
                        experienced by the SYHA as a result of the outbreak of 
                        foot-and-mouth disease, and urges organisations and individuals 
                        in Scotland to show their support in this time of difficulty.
