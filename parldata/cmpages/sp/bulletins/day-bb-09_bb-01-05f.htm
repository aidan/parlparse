<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3154</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Life Should be Life</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the comments by the Lord Advocate on 17 December 2008 calling for life imprisonment to mean life imprisonment in certain cases; notes that she suggests that the current sentencing tariffs are not adequate, and welcomes the suggestion of a further review of sentencing in murder cases.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3153</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>The Late Sir Bernard Crick</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the passing away of Sir Bernard Crick, who devoted his life to political and constitutional philosophy, championing the political system as the only tested alternative to government by coercion, and contributed to the understanding of citizenship and published influential works, including <em>George</em> <em>Orwell: A Life</em>, and notes that Sir Bernard was interested in the notion of positive citizenship throughout the world, including in his adopted homeland of Scotland, that he will be sadly missed by all who knew him and by democrats everywhere and that the legacy of his works will live on.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Bashir Ahmad<strong>*</strong>, Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Bob Doris<strong>*</strong>, Des McNulty<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3152</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Public Analyst Laboratories</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of public analysts in the wider framework of food quality checks; recognises the crucial role played by public analysts in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in enforcing the recall of all Irish-produced pork products after they identified that animal feed contaminated with harmful toxins had infected pig products; notes with concern that 11 public analyst laboratories across the United Kingdom have closed in the last 13 years; is alarmed that there are currently only 24 public analyst laboratories left, of which four are in Scotland; is further concerned that the fate of Aberdeen city&rsquo;s Public Analyst Laboratory hangs in the balance, with the distinct possibility that it will be closed and the services contracted out to Tayside Scientific Services in Dundee; is deeply concerned that the wider public health role of public analysts is in danger despite the increasing demand by consumers for better quality food, and calls on the Scottish Government to conduct a review of arrangements for the funding of public analysts to ensure that food quality and safety are not compromised by the pressure on local government budgets.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3109</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Councillor Anthea Dickson</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates SNP councillor Anthea Dickson, elected on 11 December 2008 to serve the people of Kilbirnie and Beith Ward on North Ayrshire Council in Cunninghame North constituency; notes that Anthea more than doubled the SNP share of the vote from 23.4% in 2007 to 48.9% in 2008 with a swing of 15% from Labour; is aware that in 2007, even as the SNP won Cunninghame North by 48 votes, it polled 831 fewer votes than Labour in Kilbirnie and Beith but has now polled 424 more; recognises that Labour has two branches in the area, including Scotland&rsquo;s biggest, two Labour clubs and that the MP, Katy Clark, has two offices in Kilbirnie and Beith, and believes that if the SNP can win in such traditionally strong Labour territory it can look forward with confidence to even greater success elsewhere in the months and years ahead.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3107</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Keep Royal Mail in the Public Sector</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the imminent publication of the Hooper review on the future of the Royal Mail; is concerned that this may be used as an excuse by Lord Mandelson and the UK Labour government to break its manifesto pledge not to privatise Royal Mail; believes that Royal Mail should not be broken up or privatised either wholly or partially, and calls on the UK Government to confirm that privatisation will not be countenanced.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3105</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Further Delay in Publishing Energy Efficiency and Microgeneration Action Plan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the further delay of up to a year in the publication of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s energy efficiency and microgeneration action plan; notes that, as recently as 5 November 2008, the action plan was promised by the Scottish Government in 2008; notes the findings of the Stern review that energy efficiency could deliver up to 53% of the total greenhouse gas emission reductions required in the United Kingdom by 2050 and the conclusion of Audit Scotland&rsquo;s report of 11 December 2008 on energy efficiency in the public sector that there is a need for the Scottish Government to give stronger leadership to deliver improvements in energy efficiency, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward an ambitious action plan on energy efficiency and microgeneration without delay.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3095#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Scottish Coastal Path</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the development of core path networks, which it believes can make a major contribution to both encouraging healthy exercise and attracting tourists to Scotland, and particularly welcomes those in the South of Scotland; considers that coastal paths have a particular attractiveness because of the beauty of Scotland&rsquo;s coastline; further considers that long-distance paths have a particular role to play in attracting walkers to undertake at least part of the journey along such paths; congratulates those councils that have already created and marked paths along all or part of their coastlines, and believes that the creation of a Scottish coastal path, marked and marketed as such, would be a worthwhile long-term objective and would provide a national asset.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3038#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Devastating Cuts At The Herald and Evening Times</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the announcement that all staff at <em>The Herald </em>and <em>Evening Times</em> in Glasgow will be made redundant and have to re-apply for their jobs under new terms and conditions, which it believes will inevitably leave them worse off, and further believes that this reorganisation will have a damaging effect on editorial independence among the titles and should be re-evaluated.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2957#</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Forensic Science Laboratory</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposals made by the Scottish Police Services Authority for the closure of the forensic science laboratory in Aberdeen; welcomes the direction issued by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to the authority in May 2008 that it should engage in fresh consultation with interested parties; considers, with regret, that the authority&rsquo;s consultation document published in November 2008 amounts to no more than a further case for closure; believes that the authority has thereby appeared to suggest that the conclusion of its consultation has already been determined in favour of closure, and further believes that the continued provision of forensic services to Grampian Police and Northern Constabulary by the forensic laboratory in Aberdeen is one of a number of options worthy of proper consideration in a meaningful consultation process.</p>
