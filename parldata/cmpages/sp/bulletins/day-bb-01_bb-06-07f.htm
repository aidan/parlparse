            Craigie: Forth &amp; Clyde Canal</strong>—That the Parliament notes the 

            recent re-opening of the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal; congratulates the 

            British Waterways Board, the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal Society and Falkirk, 

            North Lanarkshire, Glasgow City and West and East Dunbartonshire Councils 

            for working in a co-operative fashion to make this ambitious project 

            a reality; further notes the major boost the re-opening of the canal 

            has given the communities on its banks and looks forward to augmented 

            leisure facilities being provided along the route of the canal and 

            the economic spin-off that will follow, and further looks forward 

            to the next step in the completion of the project which is the opening 

            of the Falkirk Wheel and the resulting link between the Forth &amp; 

            Clyde and Union Canals.</font></p>

            Elder: Contribution of the Open University to Lifelong Learning</strong>—That 

            the Parliament extends its congratulations to the Open University 

            (OU), which has awarded bachelor and postgraduate degrees to over 

            1,100 students in Scotland this year; acknowledges that 77% of these 

            students attain their degree whilst working full-time; notes that 

            the number of OU graduates has increased by 19% over the last year, 

            illustrating the increasing demand for university level courses and 

            qualifications which are delivered flexibly; believes that the age 

            of OU graduates, which ranges from 22 to 85 with the average age of 

            an OU graduate being 43, illustrates that lifelong learning is a reality 

            in Scotland, and congratulates the 771 graduates who received awards, 

            of which 125 were postgraduate degrees, at the Glasgow Royal Concert 

            Hall on 5 May 2001.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1996#</strong> <strong>Christine 

            Grahame: Residential Home Closures</strong>—That the Parliament notes with 

            concern the closure and threatened closure of many residential homes 

            in the voluntary, charitable and private sectors; considers that this 

            is directly attributable to under-funding by local authorities over 

            a period of years; notes that the Church of Scotland, with 34 homes 

            with 900 residents, has an overall running deficit of £1.5 million 

            per annum, with losses last year alone amounting to £3.5 million, 

            and that the spokesman for the Church’s Board of Social Responsibility 

            has stated that the situation is at crisis point, and therefore believes 

            that the Scottish Executive should address this situation immediately.
