<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5026</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>The Draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2005 Amendment (No. 3) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Finance Committee recommends that the Draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2005 Amendment (No. 3) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5025</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Scottish Monument in Flanders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the people of Zonnebeke in Flanders for their efforts in raising funds to build a Scottish monument, a Celtic cross made from Corrennie Pink granite from Scotland, which will be dedicated to all the Scottish soldiers who fought in the Great War, wherever they came from; notes that it is not aimed at glorifying war but that its sole purpose is to remember all Scottish involvement, from the Canadian Scottish to the 1st South African Brigade which was part of the 9th (Scottish) Division; further notes that there is no monument at present in any part of the Ypres Salient dedicated to any Scottish regiments and that this monument will be a tribute to every Scottish soldier, whatever his regiment; recognises the efforts of the local authorities of Passchendaele, Wytschaete and Messines for their planning of year-long events in 2007 to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Third Battle of Ypres, otherwise known as &quot;Passchendaele&quot; in which there were over 500,000 British and German casualties, and further recognises that the Celtic cross will be an important, permanent reminder in keeping alive the memory of the Scottish soldiers from the Great War and will also serve as a wonderful testament to the people of Flanders in showing their thanks for the sacrifice of the Scottish soldiers and also to those Scots whose final resting place is far away from home in &quot;Flanders Fields&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5024</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Time for the Right to Abortion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the national pro-choice week of action, currently taking place; is appalled that, according to the World Health Organisation, 200 women per day die from unsafe abortions; expresses concern that a woman&rsquo;s right to control her own fertility and destiny is still not a right enshrined in law in Scotland or the United Kingdom; condemns the US Government&rsquo;s attacks on women&rsquo;s access to abortion at home and internationally; believes that the current legal framework embeds inequality of women; believes that women are entitled to access quick, safe, supported, non-judgemental and informed abortion services within the NHS when that is what they have chosen, which would reduce the stress of the whole situation, and further believes that the requirement to have the permission of two doctors in order to obtain an abortion should be abolished.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5023</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Low Wages in the Scottish Tourism Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the tourism industry is worth &pound;4.2 billion to the Scottish economy yet those employed in the sector have the lowest gross weekly earnings of all workers in Scotland, some &pound;46 a week lower than those in the next lowest-paid sector, agriculture; also notes that the most recent job centre survey carried out by the Scottish Low Pay Unit found that 88% of vacancies advertised in the tourism and leisure sector paid under half male median weekly earnings and that 10% of wages offered were below the then minimum wage rate, and calls for the tourism industry to address the scandalously low wages paid to its workforce and for the Scottish Executive to carry out a publicity campaign to draw workers&rsquo; attention to their legal rights to a minimum wage and, in particular, to target those new Scots from Poland and other parts of eastern Europe whose first language is not English and who are reported to be the subject of illegal exploitation by unscrupulous employers.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5022</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Blockade of Coca Cola Bottling Plants in Venezuela by Employees Seeking Severance Benefits</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the blockade of Coca Cola bottling and distribution plants throughout Venezuela by former employees of the company seeking their rightful severance benefits which the company has refused to pay; believes that Coca Cola&rsquo;s failure to pay such benefits when its net worldwide profits for the last quarter were over $1.46 billion illustrates the total lack of social responsibility shown by global multinational companies whose only concern is to maximise profits at the expense of workers, and expresses its support for the courageous stance of the ex-employees and wishes them success in their action.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5021</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Scotland Needs Physios</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great concern the current levels of unemployment of physiotherapist graduates in Scotland, with an estimated half of this year&rsquo;s graduates unable to find employment within the NHS in Scotland; notes that people are living longer with more chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis and therefore more physiotherapists are desperately needed to help rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons; considers that it is a disgrace that patients are on waiting lists throughout Scotland but that newly qualified physiotherapists are unable to practise their skills to help them; notes that thousands of working days are lost due to musculoskeletal disorders every year in Scotland; recognises the value of workplace physiotherapy in the fight against work-related ill health, that prevention is better than cure and that there is also an important role for physiotherapists in communities, but that these graduates will not be able to assist any of these patients to live normal and active lives because the graduates will be unemployed physiotherapists, and considers that this is unacceptable and a significant waste of public investment in the education of these graduates.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5020</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Scottish Public Services Ombudsman</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the important work that the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) undertakes for the Scottish public and its vital role in investigating complaints against public bodies; welcomes the SPSO&rsquo;s commitment to improve the delivery of services provided by bodies under its jurisdiction and further welcomes recent changes that the SPSO has made to improve access to its services for complainants; notes that in 2005-06 the SPSO received 99% more enquires and 56% more complaints than in 2004-05, and believes that the SPSO&rsquo;s annual budget must reflect the increased demands placed on the SPSO so that its office is appropriately staffed and resourced to continue to carry out its work, with any increased funding to come from reducing the budgets of other commissioners and ombudsmen.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5019</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Wear It Pink</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that nearly 4,000 women in Scotland will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006; endorses Breast Cancer Campaign&rsquo;s organisation of &quot;wear it pink&quot; on Friday 27 October 2006; notes the importance of the event in promoting awareness of breast cancer among the general public; encourages MSPs to participate in the initiative to help raise funds for independent breast cancer research at centres of excellence throughout the United Kingdom, and congratulates Breast Cancer Campaign and all of its supporters for having raised nearly &pound;1.7 million in 2005 through &quot;wear it pink&quot;.</p>

<p>*<strong>S2M-5018</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon on behalf of the Local Government and Transport Committee: Provision of Rail Passenger Services (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament does not agree to the general principles of the Provision of Rail Passenger Services (Scotland) Bill.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
