          <p>3.30 pm&#9;Debate on Action to Recruit, Retain and Value Nurses-

          <p><strong>S1M-3078</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Action 
            to Recruit, Retain and Value Nurses</strong>-That the Parliament pays 
            tribute to the vital contribution made by all members of health care 
            teams across Scotland but, in this International Nurses' Week, recognises 
            the central role of nurses and midwives in delivering high quality 
            patient care and supports the significant investment and action to 
            recruit, retain and value nurses and midwives being delivered through 
            Facing the Future and other initiatives. </p>
          <blockquote>

            <p><strong>S1M-3078.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Action to 
              Recruit, Retain and Value Nurses</strong>-As an amendment to motion 
              (S1M-3078) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;; 
              notes that a newly registered nurse's salary, at £16,005, is 9.7% 
              less than that of a newly qualified police constable and 11% less 
              than that of a qualified teacher; believes that addressing low pay 
              levels is central to addressing the problem of recruiting and retaining 
              nurses; further welcomes the work of the Scottish Integrated Workforce 
              Planning Group, and notes that the development of an adequately 
              resourced workforce planning strategy is essential if NHS employers 
              are to offer nurses the flexible working patterns and meaningful 
              career paths that they are entitled to expect from a 21st century 
              employer and that will enable them to continue working in the NHS.

            <p> <strong>S1M-3078.2</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Action to Recruit, 
              Retain and Value Nurses</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3078) 
              in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;and supports&quot; 
              to end and insert &quot;notes with concern, however, the recent 
              decrease in nurse numbers; acknowledges that better staffing levels 
              and conditions will lead to better morale and therefore higher levels 
              of nurse retention, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to 
              promote a more flexible system that would recruit and retain appropriate 
              numbers of nurses and midwives to serve Scotland's needs.&quot;
