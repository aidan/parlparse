<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00412 Jackie Baillie: Action on Standards for Children with Asthma</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the survey by Health Improvement Scotland on part of the mandatory standards of care for children and young people with asthma published on 27 June 2011; understands that there are 72,000 children with asthma in Scotland, one of the highest rates in the world, and that the standards were developed to ensure that children and young people with asthma receive a high level of care no matter where they live in Scotland; notes that the survey shows that some NHS boards have no register of local children and young people who have asthma, fail to record the number of children admitted to hospital with asthma symptoms and have not developed a care protocol for such children and young people; believes that the Scottish Government must make asthma a priority given that emergency admissions for children have remained at a high level for the last 10 years without any sign of being reduced; further believes that Health Improvement Scotland should examine NHS boards against all of the standards of care for children, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that NHS boards end what is considered the complacency that exists towards children with asthma.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00411 Humza Yousaf: Dennistoun Community Youth Project Awarded BoS Grant</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Dennistoun Community Youth Project (DCYP) on being one of the six charities in Glasgow awarded a share of more than &pound;69,000 from the Bank of Scotland Foundation Small Grants Programme and recognises that DCYP outreach teams work in Dennistoun, Milnbank, Wellpark and Reidvale, aiming to encourage young people to take part in various activities in the area and to provide information to the young people so that they can make an informed choice in life.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd, Paul Martin, Kevin Stewart, Kenneth Gibson, Jean Urquhart, Bob Doris</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00410 Neil Bibby: Armed Forces Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises Armed Forces Day on 25 June 2011; welcomes this occasion as an opportunity for members of the public to show their appreciation for armed forces personnel who risk their lives to defend peace, promote freedom and make the world a safer place; believes the armed forces to be the finest in the world and a credit to the country, and hopes that the Scottish public will get involved in Armed Forces Day events across Scotland to mark this important occasion, the highlight of which will take place in Edinburgh, culminating in a parade of up to 1,500 serving personnel, veterans and cadets down the Royal Mile from the Castle Esplanade to Holyrood Park.</p>
<p>Supported by: James Kelly, Liam McArthur, Elaine Murray, Kenneth Gibson, Jackie Baillie, Ken Macintosh, Mark Griffin, Kezia Dugdale, Rhoda Grant, Jamie McGrigor, Drew Smith</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00409 Colin Keir: Dawid Stepien Wins Prize in National Galleries Competition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dawid Stepien, of Oakland School in Edinburgh, on winning first prize in the Special Education Schools category in the Art Competition for Schools 2011; notes that the competition was hosted by the National Galleries of Scotland; recognises that Dawid&rsquo;s work was selected out of 5,895 entries, and notes with pleasure that his artwork will tour other venues in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00408 Colin Keir: Paul Egan to Sail in Britain&rsquo;s Largest Yacht Race</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes luck to Paul Egan of Edinburgh on his bid to compete in the 80th year of Britain&rsquo;s largest yacht race, the JP Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race, a 50-nautical-mile-long regatta on 25 June 2011, comprising of a record 1,908 competitors, where the goal is to circumnavigate the Isle of Wight.</p>
