That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

            <p><strong>*S2M-2341</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>The Life and Work of Alexander Naysmith</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the outstanding life and work of the Scottish artist, Alexander Naysmith; notes that the man, born in Edinburgh&rsquo;s Grassmarket in 1758, was trained originally as a coach painter, was a gifted engineer and developed under the tutorship of Allan Ramsay to become a renowned portrait painter; notes that this friend and collaborator of Robert Burns suffered because of his strong support for a Scottish republic and his sympathies for the French and American revolutions by being blacklisted and denied work but later retrained as a landscape artist of outstanding regard, and believes that the Parliament should mark the life of Alexander Naysmith by displaying some of his work in Holyrood amongst its collection of artwork.</p>
            
            <p><strong>*S2M-2340</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the World Wheelchair Curling Champions - Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the World Wheelchair Curling Champions, Scotland, on their outstanding victory at Braehead during the World Wheelchair Curling finals; further notes the excellent example set by Scotland&rsquo;s World Wheelchair Curling team for both disabled and able-bodied athletes throughout the country; notes that the sport will be part of the Winter Paralympics for the first time in Turin later this year, and wishes Scotland&rsquo;s winning team all the best in that event.</p>
            <p><strong>S2M-2339</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Proposed New Powers for Home Secretary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views with grave concern proposals from the UK Home Secretary in relation to further extension of anti-terrorism legislation; views legislation that would enable the Home Secretary to order individuals to surrender their passport, the imposition of curfews, electronic tagging, reporting regularly to police, limits on use of the telephone and the internet and house arrest without being placed on trial as being totally unacceptable and a further extension of the already draconian powers available to the Home Secretary; notes that the number of people from Asian backgrounds stopped and searched by police has increased by 300% since the Terrorism Act 2000 came into force and further notes the comments of Guy Mansfield QC, chairman of the Bar Council, who said that &quot;Disproportionate measures risk radicalising the community from which a detainee comes. That may make this country less rather than more safe&quot;; notes that already there is press speculation that the new powers may also be used to target individuals such as animal right activists; notes that anti-terrorism legislation was used routinely during the policing of peace demonstrations at RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, and believes that it opens the door for the Home Secretary to target those taking legitimate and peaceful protest action with the proposed new powers.</p>

            <p><strong>S2M-2336</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>McDonald&rsquo;s Continued Presence in Primary Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of McDonald&rsquo;s to curtail its presence in UK primary schools, as reported in <em>Marketing Magazine</em> on 12 January 2005; welcomes the withdrawal of McDonald&rsquo;s-sponsored educational material and teaching assistants from primary schools; hopes that this will lead to a complete withdrawal of McDonald&rsquo;s material from schools, and calls on McDonald&rsquo;s and other corporations to stop using educational sponsorship as a vehicle for advertising their products to children in compulsory schooling.</p>
