          <p><strong>*S2M-844#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Hutton 
            Report</strong>-That the Parliament notes that there are widespread 
            allegations that the Hutton Report is a cover-up conducted by a hand-picked 
            member of the British legal establishment who previously represented 
            British soldiers in the now discredited Widgery Inquiry into Bloody 
            Sunday which many consider covered up the role of British paratroopers; 
            views the attacks on the BBC in the Hutton Report as an attempt to 
            create a climate of fear and intimidation within the organisation 
            and further evidence of moves towards the suppression of free and 
            open reporting within the UK; congratulates all BBC staff in Scotland 
            and the rest of the UK for taking action in defence of journalistic 
            integrity within the organisation; is outraged at the apology offered 
            to the government by the former political secretary to Margaret Thatcher 
            who is now acting chair of the BBC Board of Governors, and further 
            considers that the war against Iraq was based entirely on a tissue 
            of lies and therefore that the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, should 
            resign.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-843</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Dead 
            Tired</strong>-That the Parliament notes the findings in the report 
            endorsed by the British Sleep Society <em>Dead Tired</em>, in particular 
            that the International Classification of Sleep Disorders lists some 
            84 sleep disorders placed in various categories including dysomnias 
            (initiating and maintaining sleep), parasomnias (nightmares, sleep-walking, 
            sleep-talking) and extrinsic sleep disorders such as alcohol-dependent 
            sleep, that some 70,000 Scots are estimated to have some form of sleep 
            disorder though the actual figure may be much higher, that sleepiness 
            is estimated to be the cause of some 20% of motorway accidents, that 
            sleep disorders have a direct impact on the workplace and employment 
            prospects, that the direct costs to the NHS have never been properly 
            assessed and that the impact on the individual and his or her family 
            can be family break-up; notes that healthcare provision for sleep 
            disorders in the NHS is, to say the least, inadequate; notes that 
            there has been little or no training for professionals and little 
            or no research into sleep disorders, and therefore considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should issue, as a first step, guidance for 
            professionals and the general public on sleep disorders and initiate 
            research into the (a) scale of the problem, (b) cost to the public 
            purse and (c) current provision in the public, private and voluntary 
            sectors, of people with sleep disorders.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-842</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to the University of Edinburgh</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the University of Edinburgh for being ranked 8th in Europe and 43rd 
            worldwide in the table of world universities compiled by the prestigious 
            Shanghai Jiao Tong University Institute of Higher Education; recognises 
            that the University of Edinburgh continues to provide a world class 
            education for all Scottish students and applauds the fact that nine 
            of its departments received excellent ratings in the last UK Government 
            Research Assessment Exercise, and believes that the whole of Scotland 
            will benefit from a mix of students from around the world attending 
            Scottish universities.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-841</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>The 
            Future of Caledonian MacBrayne</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            unreservedly the European Commission's revised guidelines on State 
            Aid to Maritime Transport, published on 17 January 2004, and the Commission 
            Communication (COM (2003) 595); salutes the work done by Professor 
            Sir Neil MacCormick MEP in forcing the Commission to acknowledge that 
            the previous guidelines did not take into account the special conditions 
            that prevail around Scotland's coast; recognises that ferry services 
            need no longer be put out to tender, that public service contracts 
            can now be awarded simply on the basis of a call for expressions of 
            interest, that public service obligations will now be permitted on 
            mainland to mainland routes instead of only routes to islands and 
            that public service contracts may now be imposed throughout the network 
            if an international transport service is necessary to&nbsp;meet&nbsp;imperative&nbsp;transport 
            needs, and calls on the Scottish Executive to scrap once and for all 
            the costly, and&nbsp;now pointless, tendering process for Caledonian 
            MacBrayne.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-840</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>20 
            mph Speed Zones Around Schools in Dundee</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates Dundee City Council on its decision to introduce 20 
            mph speed limits in the area of all of its primary and secondary schools; 
            regards this decision as an important step in improving road safety 
            amongst both school children and road users in and around schools, 
            and further regards it as a step towards the successful accomplishment 
            of the Scottish Executive's target of reducing by half the number 
            of children killed or seriously injured in road accidents by the year 
            2010.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Kate Maclean<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-839#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Safety 
            Belts on School Buses</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the 
            Scottish Executive should ensure greater standards of safety in school 
            transport by drawing up a phased timetable, with appropriate targets, 
            so that all buses contracted by local education authorities to carry 
            children between school and home and on school trips will be fitted 
            with seatbelts.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-838</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Asylum 
            and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That 
            the Parliament endorses the principle of creating a new offence to 
            combat trafficking in human beings for non-sexual exploitation as 
            set out in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) 
            Bill and agrees that the provisions to achieve this end in Scotland 
            which relate to devolved matters should be considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-837</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Solidarity 
            with Diane Wilson</strong>-That the Parliament notes with alarm the 
            charges of criminal trespass and resisting arrest brought against 
            leading US environmental activist Diane Wilson; acknowledges that 
            these charges are an attempt to silence a woman whose only crime has 
            been to act peacefully in the interests of the people of Texas; recognises 
            that the actions committed were only an attempt to draw attention 
            to Union Carbide/Dow's moral responsibility to face up to the ongoing 
            horrors in Bhopal, India, the scene of the world's worst industrial 
            disaster, and calls upon the Texan authorities to recognise that Diane 
            was motivated by nothing more than the necessity of alerting the people 
            of Texas to the dangers posed by the pesticide industry and to drop 
            all criminal charges against her.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-836#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Inadequate 
            Consultation by Royal Mail on Closure of Local Post Offices</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that the consultation period for Royal Mail's 
            proposed closures of post offices started on 2<SUP> </SUP>December 
            2003 and ended only six weeks later, spanning the Christmas and New 
            Year holiday period, thereby pressurising post office users and elected 
            representatives to respond to a critically important consultation 
            at a time when they were focused on celebrations and preparations 
            for the holiday period; further notes that Royal Mail based its decisions 
            on incomplete information and a classification of settlements as rural 
            or urban that was 15 years out of date and proposed closures of post 
            offices that do comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 
            while keeping open post offices that do not comply with the Act; notes 
            that decisions to close post offices in some instances appear to have 
            been made with little regard to submissions from local representatives 
            or the views of post office users and that in some cases the decisions 
            have been made prior to consultation meetings with the public having 
            taken place, and is concerned at Royal Mail's style of consultation 
            that goes to the heart of how this decision-maker has treated with 
            contempt individuals in communities across Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-835#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Hepatitis 
            C Ex Gratia Payment Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            the ex gratia payment scheme for people infected with hepatitis C 
            from NHS blood or blood products will now be administered through 
            a UK-wide scheme; regrets that there has been a delay of over a year 
            in establishing this scheme due to protracted negotiations between 
            the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government; believes that 
            the scheme is flawed as it does not include payments to the relatives 
            of those who have died from hepatitis C, and further believes that 
            the Executive should reconsider the level of payments and the exclusion 
            of family members from the ex gratia payment scheme.</P>

            Cunningham, Nicola Sturgeon, Stewart Stevenson</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-834</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The 
            Draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2003 Amendment Order 2004</strong>-That 
            the Finance Committee recommends that the draft Budget (Scotland) 
            Act 2003 Amendment Order 2004 be approved.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-833#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Tax 
            Stamps on Scotch Whisky Products</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern that Her Majesty's Government is once again considering 
            the introduction of tax stamps on spirits, but not on wine or beer; 
            recognises that any such tax stamp would impact particularly on the 
            Scotch whisky industry; believes that the case for a tax stamp system 
            is not proven and that it would be an ineffective means of combating 
            fraud and illicit trade while imposing substantial costs and practical 
            problems on the industry, particularly in relation to labelling and 
            storage; notes the Scottish Executive's Scotch whisky framework which 
            supports a fair taxation regime for Scotch whisky, and therefore believes 
            that the Executive should make representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            against the introduction of tax stamps or any similar burdens on the 
            Scotch whisky industry.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-832#</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Charitable 
            Organisations' Water Charges</strong>-That the Parliament expresses 
            concern over the current rules of the Water and Sewerage Charges Exemption 
            Scheme for charities which exclude charities formed after 1 April 
            1999, and any formed before that date which subsequently moved premises, 
            from exemption from water and wastewater charges; notes that the move 
            to high standing charges recommended by the Water Industry Commissioner 
            has adversely affected such organisations, and further notes that 
            the Water Customer Consultation Panel's report on the principles of 
            charging in August 2003 sought a national, open consultation on the 
            best principles to be applied and that such consultation needs to 
            be started soon.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-831#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Disabled 
            Parking Spaces</strong>-That the Parliament notes the difficulties 
            experienced by people within local communities who have secured disabled 
            parking spaces outside their homes; deplores the fact that these spaces 
            can become a focus of conflict within communities where people seek 
            to use a space, although they do not have a disabled parking badge; 
            recognises that the current legal position, which distinguishes between 
            courtesy parking spaces and those supported by traffic regulation 
            orders, creates problems for people with disabilities who need to 
            rely on a designated parking space; considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should examine how it might legislate to address this problem, and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive, local authorities and all relevant 
            agencies should work together to develop an awareness campaign to 
            highlight the rights of disabled people and to emphasise the unacceptability 
            of harassing those who have been allocated such spaces.</P>

            work of Rikki Fulton for the joy and laughter he brought to generations 
            of Scots; extends its sympathy to his wife, family and wide circle 
            of friends, and commends his courage in speaking openly of his struggle

            up police time and help agencies deal more effectively with the problem 
            of hard drugs, the Scottish Executive should seek to reach an agreement

            for possessing amounts of cannabis for personal use and where a network 
            of licensed cannabis outlets can be established along the lines of 
            the Dutch model for the sale of small amounts of cannabis prior to 
            any change in the legal status of the Class C substance.</P>

            notes the crucial role of co-operative and mutual organisations within 
            local communities and across Scotland; recognises the wide variety 
            in size, capacity and in areas of activity of co-operative and mutual 
            initiatives; congratulates those involved within the co-operative 
            and mutual sector both on the key role they play in local and Scottish-wide 
            economic activity and in delivering social justice; welcomes the commitment 
            of the Scottish Executive to establish a Co-operative Development 
            Agency (CDA), and believes that departments across the range of Executive 
            responsibilities must work together to ensure that the CDA will effectively 
            support and strengthen co-operative and mutual enterprises in all 
            their diversity.</P>

            Parliament recognises the importance of Holocaust Memorial Day; acknowledges 
            the significance of 27 January as the anniversary of the liberation 
            of Auschwitz in 1945 and remembers those before and since whose lives 
            were cut short because of acts of genocide; thanks the survivors for 
            their enduring courage and strength, for sharing their memories and 
            for their living testimony to the inhumanity of which we are capable; 
            warns of the dangers that still exist because of racial discrimination; 
            reaffirms the need to make succeeding generations aware of the horrors 
            that can stem from ignorance and prejudice, and pledges tolerance 
            and respect for others as a fitting memorial to those who died in 
            the cruelty and barbarity of the Holocaust.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-822#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>&quot;In 
            Touch&quot;, Out of Touch?</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            success of projects such as &quot;In Touch&quot; in Galashiels which, 
            through New Futures funding, enables young people between the ages 
            of 16 and 25 to move towards education, training and employment; further 
            notes that since January 2000, when the project started, some 200 
            young people have used its facilities, that currently there are 35 
            to 40 clients, that some referrals are from social work, some from 
            youth offending services and some are from Penumbra, among other agencies, 
            that of those who have taken part for whom outcomes are known only 
            five are known to have gone to, or returned to, prison and that 23 
            started in full-time employment, four started in part-time work and 
            31 went into some form of further education; is most concerned that 
            this project will run out of New Futures funding at the end of March 
            2004, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should as 
            a matter of urgency provide, either through direct funding or through 
            the Scottish Enterprise New Futures Fund, interim funding until either 
            the termination of the New Futures Fund nationally or &quot;In Touch&quot; 
            secures substitute funding, whichever is the earlier.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-821</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Local

          <p><strong>S2M-820</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Alternative 
            MMR Vaccine Research</strong>-That the Parliament commends the Irish 
            Government and the Science Foundation of Ireland for awarding a £482,000 
            grant to fund research by Professor Greg Atkins of Trinity College, 
            Dublin, into the development of a new synthetic alternative to MMR; 
            believes that the Irish Government has shown foresight and helped 
            move the debate on vaccination policy forward everywhere by recognising 
            that a causal link between MMR and children having autism and bowel 
            disease has neither been confirmed or refuted; further believes that 
            compatible research should be funded in Scotland and that, in the 
            meantime, single vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella should be 
            made available to all parents as well as MMR, and believes that this 
            would improve confidence in vaccination policy and increase uptake 
            to levels more likely to ensure herd immunity.</P>

            Scottish Partnership on Domestic Abuse, while continuing its efforts 
            to campaign against abuse by a partner, to widen the definition of 
            domestic abuse to cover all abuse among the members of a household.</P>

            uncertainty over the funding of higher education, the response by 
            some alumni who expect today's higher education students to incur 
            significant debt to pay for a privilege that they received at no direct 
            cost to themselves, upfront or thereafter and who, in addition, received 
            adequate financial assistance at the expense of the general taxpayer, 
            and therefore believes it is incumbent on the Scottish Executive to 
            ensure that any future review of higher education funding guarantees 
            that everyone who has benefited from a university education contributes 
            fairly to it through a retrospective but progressive graduate tax.</P>

            the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and acknowledges 
            that photodynamic therapy is the only effective treatment for wet 
            AMD, the most aggressive form of the disease and the leading cause 
            of blindness in the UK, with around 650 new patients diagnosed with 
            wet AMD in Scotland every year; is deeply concerned that funding has 
            not been made available for clinicians to treat on the NHS those patients 
            who urgently require the therapy, and endorses the demand by the Royal 
            National Institute of the Blind Scotland and the Macular Disease Society 
            that the Scottish Executive ensures that funding is immediately provided
