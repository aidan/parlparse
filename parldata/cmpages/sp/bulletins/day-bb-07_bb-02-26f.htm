<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5652</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Greenpeace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Greenpeace on its recent blockade of a Trident nuclear submarine at its base at Faslane; considers that Tony Blair is pushing through the replacement of Trident, an immoral, illegal and unnecessary weapon, against the wishes of the majority of the British people; acknowledges that its replacement will pose a threat to the security of the world, both by the possibility of it being used and by encouraging other countries to maintain or develop their own nuclear weapons, and calls on the Scottish Executive to stand up for the people of Scotland and the world and put pressure on Tony Blair to scrap the Trident replacement.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5651</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Living Streets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Manifesto for Scottish Streets 2007, produced by Living Streets, a charity which campaigns for better streets and public spaces for people on foot; recognises that getting more people walking will help address climate change through reduced car use, tackle obesity, reduce congestion and air and noise pollution, reduce deaths and injuries on the road and involve communities in their local area, thereby improving social cohesion, and urges the Scottish Executive and local authorities to address concerns that people have with their streets which are preventing them from feeling safe walking in their communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5650</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Equal Prize Money for Women at Wimbledon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the All England Club for deciding to offer equal prize money across the board to both men and women players in the Wimbledon Championships with effect from the 2007 championships; applauds male and female tennis players for the positive role models that they offer to young people in terms of health and fitness; appreciates that the major contribution made by the women players at Wimbledon is at last being recognised, and calls on all other tennis championships to follow suit.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5649</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of North Ayrshire Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the actions of New Labour-controlled North Ayrshire Council in seeking to introduce a new pay and grading system that will result in around 14% of the workforce facing a three-year wage freeze followed by a pay cut; notes that the council cites meeting equal pay obligations in an attempt to justify its actions but considers that local authorities, as employers, have known of their equal rights obligations for a number of years and should not have been paying women less than their male counterparts in the first place; believes that many North Ayrshire Council workers are being made to pay for the incompetence of the New Labour administration of the council, and  calls on North Ayrshire Council to seek an alternative option that does not result in workers being made poorer as a result of the actions of incompetent New Labour councillors.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5648</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Shop Locally - Use it or Lose it Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &quot;Shop Locally - use it or lose it&quot; campaign, launched in Alloa by the Forth Valley branch of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), which aims to encourage the use of local shops, protect existing jobs and safeguard the vitality of the community; notes with concern the FSB Scotland report, <em>Effect of Supermarkets on Existing Retailers</em>, which found that as many as 80% of shoppers now do most of their food shopping in a new supermarket and revealed that between 2002 and 2004 Alloa dropped from 550th to 829th place in the Management Horizons Europe (MHE) shopping index, and calls on the Scottish Executive and Scottish local authorities to do more to help Alloa High Street and dozens of similarly affected town centres across Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5643</strong> <strong>Mr Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>Sale of Weir Pumps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the surprise announcement by Weir Group plc to end over 130 years of world-class engineering by selling its pumps division to Sulzer AG, despite the division&rsquo;s profitability and full order book, with the ultimate loss of 450 jobs but with no consultation with unions, Scottish Enterprise or local parliamentarians; notes that Weir Group plc has now reversed its previous commitment to relocate its pumps division to a new factory in the Glasgow area, thus rejecting assistance from Glasgow City Council and Scottish Enterprise; further notes Weir Group plc&rsquo;s rejection in 2004 of an offer of &pound;2.5 million of Regional Selective Assistance to modernise its Cathcart plant; notes that Scottish Development International and Glasgow City Council have assisted Weir Group plc to access new markets in Russia; further notes that Weir Group plc&rsquo;s secretiveness in this matter meant that other options with the potential to retain jobs, such as Clyde Blowers Ltd&rsquo;s expressed interest in acquiring Weir Pumps, were not properly considered, and believes that Weir Group plc&rsquo;s conduct in this matter falls well short of acceptable standards of corporate social responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5638</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Lights Out for Incandescents Down Under</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement by the Australian Government that incandescent light bulbs will not meet mandatory energy efficiency standards after 2010 and notes that this measure will result in a reduction in Australian greenhouse gas emissions of four million tonnes per year by 2015; notes that not only do compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) use roughly one-fifth of the energy of a traditional incandescent bulb for a similar light output but that they also last several times longer, leading to significant cost savings from the use of CFLs; believes that the phasing out of inefficient light bulbs is just one step along a path towards maximum energy efficiency in all sectors within Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do everything in its power to ensure that all energy consumed in Scotland is used as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5637&diams; </strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Changing Places</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that around 3,500 people in Scotland with profound and multiple learning disabilities, as well as many thousands of other disabled people, cannot use standard accessible toilets and require public toilets with enough space for disabled people and their carers along with the right equipment, including a height adjustable changing bench and a hoist; notes the positive examples of facilities in the Meadow Centre in Dumbarton and in the Vale of Leven leisure centre; supports the Changing Places Campaign, launched by the Changing Places Consortium of MENCAP, PAMIS (Promoting a More Inclusive Society), Dumfries and Galloway Council, Nottingham City Council, the Valuing People Support Team and the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Same As You&quot; team, which is calling for more of these toilets to be installed in public places to enable disabled people and their carers to be active citizens, and notes that the Cross Party Group on Learning Disability welcomes all efforts, including those of the Parliament, to ensure that provision is made for people with profound and multiple learning disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5636</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>False Birthday Card Scam</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the methods used by the promoters of schemes to induce the public to apply for alleged free gifts, usually involving expensive phone calls, have reached a new low of sending individuals convincing-looking birthday cards with around eight to 10 apparently hand-written good wishes and signatures on one inside page and a promotion for the alleged free gifts, linked to repeated birthday wishes, on the other; urges promoters to give up such a deceitful way of securing more customers, and asks relevant regulatory bodies to press the promoters to give it up.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5618</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Bus Connectivity in Scotland and the Competition Commission</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those organisations and individuals across Scotland involved in the efforts to ensure that the bus services grow into a co-ordinated, responsive service meeting the demands of an integrated public transport service; expresses profound concern that the Competition Commission has made a determination requiring divestment of the Megabus or Stagecoach services currently operated as a joint venture, created on 12 September 2005, to operate the Scottish services of Stagecoach&rsquo;s megabus.com and Motorvator and Braddell plc&rsquo;s Scottish Citylink; observes that Stagecoach acquired 35% of the share capital of Scottish Citylink Limited in return for transferring certain rights to the Motorvator and megabus.com operations in Scotland; notes that Braddell plc owns the remaining 65% of Citylink&rsquo;s share capital with the joint venture operating services under the megabus.com and Scottish Citylink brands, and is the leading provider of express coach services in Scotland; welcomes the fact that passenger numbers have risen year on year by 41% and notes that, after stripping out the impact of the concession scheme, growth is in the region of 25%; is disturbed that the commission&rsquo;s plans may dismantle a high-quality, value-for-money and integrated network and replace it with a disintegrated collection of routes to the detriment of customers who rely on lifeline inter-city coach services; is concerned at the cost to the taxpayer of further inquiry and regrets that the issue is now presenting serious conflict in Scottish Executive transport policy; hopes that the Executive will make representations to the Competition Commission to seek a reversal of its decision that will seriously impact on the major efforts that are being made by relevant people and organisations in Scotland to produce bus services fit for the 21st century, and finally hopes that for all sectors where monopoly power is subject of Competition Commission rulings there will be equitable and fair treatment across all sectors.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5609#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Unfair Annual Railway Season Ticket Charging Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the incredible differential of &pound;304 for an annual season ticket, representing the additional cost to rail passengers travelling from North Queensferry station to South Gyle station who pay &pound;780 per annum, in contrast to annual season ticket holders from Dalmeny to South Gyle who pay &pound;476 per annum; is concerned that this difference may relate to the Forth Bridge crossing between North Queensferry and Dalmeny stations and demands an urgent investigation by Scotrail into this apparent penalty on commuters from North Queensferry; hopes, however, for a much wider review of train fares from Fife to other parts of Scotland in the knowledge that Fifers still pay the highest rail fare per kilometre of any part of Scotland, and hopes that such a review will result in a lowering of rail fares in a bid to ensure that more commuters travel by rail.</p>
