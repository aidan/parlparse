<p>2.55 pm&#9;Executive Debate: Climate Change&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4507</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Changing Our Ways: Scotland&rsquo;s Climate Change Programme</em> as a serious response to a serious challenge; notes the identification of the Scottish Share of carbon savings from devolved policies across the United Kingdom and the setting of the first ever Scottish Target to exceed that share; welcomes the commitment to report annually to Parliament on progress on implementing <em>Changing Our Ways</em> and, in the longer term, to submit the programme to an independent audit; recognises the importance that must be accorded to adapting to the unavoidable impacts of climate change, and agrees that mainstreaming climate thinking, through the carbon proofing of new policies and measures and through communication, is vital to ensuring an effective climate change response. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-4507.3</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Climate Change</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4507) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;recognises that Scotland requires many of the political powers currently reserved to the UK Government in order to build a low-carbon society and make a greater contribution to the global effort towards tackling climate change; regrets the ongoing delay in publishing the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s energy efficiency strategy; calls for the establishment of a single high-profile public sector organisation to provide a one-stop shop for the promotion of energy efficiency across all sectors; urges Scottish Ministers when reporting annually to the Parliament to publish the carbon costs and savings that have resulted from their policies, and rejects the view that new nuclear power stations offer a solution to climate change.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-4507.2</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Climate Change</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4507) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;and that all such measures must pass the test of economic sustainability.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-4507.4</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell: Climate Change</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4507) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;as a serious response&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that CO2 emissions from Scotland have not fallen since the current First Minister took office; is concerned that Scotland&rsquo;s emissions reduction since 1990 lags behind that of England;&nbsp;notes that according to the Scottish Executive about half of Scotland&rsquo;s emissions reduction is due to the decline of heavy industry and not due to Executive policy measures; recognises that emissions from energy use and transport, accounting for over half of Scotland&rsquo;s emissions, have been increasing since 1990; is concerned that there are devolved policy measures that will result in greenhouse gas emissions that have been ignored by the Executive&rsquo;s Climate Change Programme, such as motorway building and subsidies for air transport which are likely to negate savings made under the Executive&rsquo;s Scottish Share; warns the Executive that unless the Scottish Share applies to all policy measures and is part of an identifiable overall target for emissions reduction it will be meaningless; calls on the Executive to implement fully the recommendations of the&nbsp;Parliament&rsquo;s Environment and Rural Development Committee&rsquo;s <em>5th Report, 2005: Report on&nbsp;Inquiry into Climate Change</em>, including traffic reduction and energy efficiency targets; agrees with the Executive that mainstreaming climate thinking, through the carbon proofing of new policies and measures, is vital to ensuring an effective climate change response, and therefore calls on the Executive to implement carbon proofing immediately starting with all existing policies and projects.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#9;<strong>S2M-4508</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Eleanor Scott be appointed to replace Mr Mark Ruskell on the Environment and Rural Development Committee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong>&#9;Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<p><em>&#9;</em>Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-4228</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Muscular Dystrophy &quot;My Life&quot; Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that there are 3,000 people in Scotland with inherited neuromuscular disorders and muscular dystrophy; is concerned that in Cumbernauld &amp; Kilsyth, whilst some constituents tell of good provision of electric wheelchairs and praise the staff delivering social services care, some have never received a full needs assessment of their home environment and can only experience care services delivered via an inflexible system weighted towards older people that does not accommodate the lifestyle that other young people are able to enjoy; notes that this is an example of the variation in standards and availability of care, service and equipment provision across Scotland; supports the work of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign in pioneering the search for treatments and cures for over 40 years, whilst also providing practical, professional and emotional support for people affected by neuromuscular conditions; in particular, supports the Muscular Dystrophy &quot;My Life&quot; campaign and its work in Scotland to encourage a co-ordinated approach by local authorities and NHS boards when assessing individuals&rsquo; needs and requirements, and considers the findings of the &quot;My Life&quot; expert group to be a model for future delivery of services to people affected by neuromuscular conditions.</p>
