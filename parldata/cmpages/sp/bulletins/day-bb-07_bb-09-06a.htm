          <p><em>followed by </em>Ministerial Statement: Foot and Mouth Outbreak</p>
          <p><em>followed by </em>Scottish Government Debate: Tackling Drugs Misuse&mdash;</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>S3M-415</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Tackling Drugs Misuse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that tackling drugs misuse is one of the great social challenges of our time, requiring determined and sustained action; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to build consensus around a new strategy for tackling drugs misuse; welcomes the recent publication of reports, commissioned by the previous administration, on key aspects of drugs services; supports the Government&rsquo;s determination to improve services to promote recovery from drug addiction, to ensure that children are protected from the drug addictions of their parents, to improve drugs education, to offer young people more opportunities to do something positive and constructive with their lives, to strengthen enforcement and to provide courts with more effective ways of dealing with those whose crimes are driven by addiction, and recognises that there will be resource implications in meeting this challenge. </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
              <p><strong>S3M-415.1</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Tackling Drugs Misuse</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-415) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that increased opportunities, improved facilities, more drug-free activities and better drug education are necessary to give young people a positive alternative to drugs; calls on the Scottish Government to introduce a strategy for early intervention with vulnerable young people, particularly those in care or living with a parent who has a drug problem; calls for the establishment of a national register of drug and alcohol services including residential placements; believes that additional resources are required to increase drug and alcohol treatment places, cut waiting times and create more family support services; calls on the Scottish Government to commit to at least double the funding for drug and alcohol treatment in the first year of the next spending review; further notes the direct link between drug and alcohol use and crime and supports the greater use of arrest referral schemes across Scotland; further believes that Drug Testing and Treatment Orders (DTTOs) introduced by the previous administration can make a real difference in cutting crime and reoffending, and calls for DTTOs to be extended to Scotland&rsquo;s district courts and used more frequently to address alcohol abuse among offenders.&quot; </p>

          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>5.00 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em> Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
            <p><strong>S3M-347</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Maintenance of Common Land on Scottish Housing Estates</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the many complaints voiced by people throughout Scotland over the neglect of common land on their housing estates, such as Gryffe Castle in Bridge of Weir and Inch Meadows/Roseland Brae in Erskine, even although some residents pay upwards of &pound;400 per annum for the maintenance of such areas of land adjacent to their homes; notes that many of these complainers accuse the Greenbelt Group, in particular, of failing to honour its obligations to householders in relation to the company&rsquo;s maintenance of local common land; is of the view that this company and others engaged in this service should aim for the very best standards of performance, which is a legitimate demand made by householders, and, in addition to the enhancement of these maintenance standards, firmly believes in the examination of alternative management procedures and practices, such as the common hold system, which would enable the community of householders to be given more control of the common land surrounding or adjacent to their homes. </p>
