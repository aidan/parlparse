                        Parliament notes that in its first year many members working 
                        in committees, in the whole Parliament and in their constituencies 
                        have been active in moving Scotland forward; regrets that 
                        the Executive has failed to match the positive approach 
                        of Scotland during the referendum campaign of 1997 and 
                        the continuing mood of Scotland for radical change and 
                        progress; notes that in particular there is a crisis in 
                        manufacturing, a reduction in local authority services 
                        including housing, a lowering of morale in the education 
                        and health services, growing impoverishment of the elderly, 
                        the reliance on expensive PFI for public investment, a 
                        deterioration in the transport infrastructure, the abdication 
                        of responsibility for genuine consultation and good governance 
                        and a general confusion and malaise in the partnership 
                        administration; recognises the support of a majority of 
                        Scots for increased power for our Parliament to tackle 
                        these problems; notes that independence and equality of 
                        status is the best possible constitutional settlement 
                        for our nation, and looks forward to offering the people 
                        of Scotland the opportunity to choose a future of economic 
                        progress and social justice based on such a settlement.

                            Salmond, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to 
                            end and insert &quot;regrets that the Scottish Executive 
                            has failed to address the issues that really matter 
                            to the Scottish people, which has led to growing public 
                            disillusionment with its performance; believes that 
                            far greater priority should be given to addressing 
                            rising crime, raising standards in our schools, improving 
                            our transport infrastructure and tackling the crisis 
                            in the countryside and the problems of our health 
                            service, and notes that the SNP, instead of addressing 
                            these issues, continues to promote further constitutional 
                            upheaval which would be deeply damaging to the interests 
                            of everyone living in Scotland.&quot; </font></p>
