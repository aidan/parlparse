<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7534 Margaret Mitchell on behalf of the Equal Opportunities Committee: Report on Post-legislative Scrutiny: the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Equal Opportunities Committee&rsquo;s 4th Report 2010 (Session 3): <em>Report on post-legislative scrutiny: the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 </em>(SP Paper 468).</p>
<p>Supported by: Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7532&diams;   Murdo Fraser: Dual the A9 Timetable</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament understands that the A9 trunk road has the highest fatality rate of any road in Scotland and that the majority of accidents occur on single carriageway stretches; sadly notes that 2010 had seen 11 deaths on the Perth to Inverness section by 1 December; acknowledges that the A9 between these points continually switches between single and dual carriageway, which, it considers, can cause driver confusion and lead to accidents; believes that upgrading the A9 between Perth and Inverness to dual carriageway in its entirety would reduce the accident and fatality rates and in addition would help ease congestion and bring an economic boost to Mid Scotland and Fife and the Highlands, and accordingly would welcome a full and detailed timetable for such improvements.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7531 Patricia Ferguson: Property Factors (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Property Factors (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7530&diams;   Ted Brocklebank: Retention of RAF Leuchars</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that RAF Leuchars plays an essential role in the defence of the United Kingdom; commends the professionalism and dedication of military personnel who have served or serve there; considers that those who have been deployed from Leuchars on active service have given exemplary service since the First World War; believes that the case for RAF Leuchars remaining as one of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s two main fighter strike bases is overwhelming as it has a pivotal strategic position on the east coast and is adjacent to Scotland&rsquo;s major population centres; understands, however, that any considerations on how the United Kingdom&rsquo;s air defences are deployed and where aircraft should be based must be made on strategic grounds, and believes that the Secretary of State for Defence must make his decision on that basis.</p>
<p>Supported by: Elizabeth Smith<strong>*</strong>, Nanette Milne<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong>, John Lamont<strong>*</strong>, Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Mitchell<strong>*</strong>, David McLetchie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7529 Jackson Carlaw: Sentencing of Mohammed Sandia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the comments of Mohammed Sandia who posted a series of what it considers disgraceful anti-Semitic remarks on <em>The Scotsman</em> newspaper&rsquo;s website; welcomes what it considers Sheriff Gordon Liddell&rsquo;s unequivocal condemnation of Sandia&rsquo;s comments when he appeared for sentencing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on 10 November 2010; considers that Mr Sandia&rsquo;s prosecution sends out a welcome message to society at large about how indefensible anti-Semitism is and how vile its consequences can be; congratulates the determination of the police and Crown Office to pursue this case to its conclusion, and urges editors of all media, and online media outlets in particular, to be on their guard to prevent similar instances of religious or racial hatred from finding their way onto their pages in the future.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7509 Patrick Harvie: Widespread Use of CCTV</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent comments of the Assistant Chief Constable, Ruaraidh Nicholson, of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, that &quot;The continued use of public space CCTV by public authorities must be demonstrably based in evidenced need, and where that need can no longer be evidenced, we must be courageous and honest enough to step back from use of this technology&quot;; notes that the United Kingdom has wider use of public space CCTV per capita than any other country; is concerned that this widespread installation of CCTV has taken place without reference to the long-term impact on privacy and that it does nothing to address the root causes of crime or antisocial behaviour, and considers that, while CCTV will continue to have a valuable role in some circumstances, community safety resources would often be better spent on things that build communities and neighbourliness, such as improvements in street lighting, urban design and services for young people.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7508 Cathy Peattie: Carers Rights Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Friday 3 December 2010 is Carers Rights Day; acknowledges and values what it considers the substantial contribution made by over 700,000 unpaid carers and young carers across Scotland; welcomes the practical and emotional support provided by the network of Princess Royal Trust for Carers Centres across Scotland; recognises what is seen as the critical work of Falkirk Carers Centre in identifying and supporting over 53,000 carers and young carers; understands that, despite what it considers their valuable work and social impact and the inclusion of &pound;5 million of Carer Information Strategy funding for NHS boards in the draft budget, carers organisations across Scotland continue to face significant funding challenges as a result of local government cuts, and believes that all parties should demonstrate their support for unpaid carers in the Parliament and in local constituencies and regions across the country as carers centres wait to hear about local core funding over the coming weeks.</p>
