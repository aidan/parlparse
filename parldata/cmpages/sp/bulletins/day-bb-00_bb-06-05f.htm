            calling for an immediate suspension of the reprocessing of spent nuclear

            by the Scottish Executive on the upkeep of Scotland's coastline, and 
            that Scotland's councils have spent considerably more than this on

            to mate is thwarted, is both dangerous and deeply flawed and calls
