<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3090</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>The Act of Settlement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the fact that Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice Jack Straw MP is looking to change the Act of Settlement 1701; strongly believes that it is wrong to have a settled constitutional position that discriminates against any section of the population, and further believes that the Act is outdated and does not fit with multicultural life in a modern society.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3089</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the City of Edinburgh Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the City of Edinburgh Council on being the most improved urban local authority in Scotland in terms of the Audit Scotland local government statutory performance statistics for the 2007-08 financial year; notes the hard work of the new City of Edinburgh Council administration and staff in achieving these encouraging results; further notes the particular improvements in recycling rates, housing repairs and road maintenance; considers the council to have inherited a perilous financial situation from the previous administration; notes the affects of the current economic downturn and recognises that there is still a lot of hard work to be done, but welcomes the remarkable progress that the new council administration has made.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3088</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Bank Bailout Failing Small Businesses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern, despite recent assurances by the UK Government that small businesses would remain top of the agenda, the news that, according to new figures from the Federation of Small Businesses, around one third of small businesses is struggling to get affordable credit from banks; considers that the UK Government is failing to encourage lending to small businesses; commends actions taken by the Scottish Government to protect small businesses, which have seen real benefits, particularly from the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which benefits three out of four businesses, and believes that the complete lack of decisive, practicable action on the part of the UK Government further illustrates the need for the restoration of sovereignty to the people of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3087</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper&rsquo;s Threat to Lone Parents of Very Young Children and Disabled People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at proposals contained in the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper, <em>Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future</em>, to push lone parents of very young children and disabled people into taking mandatory steps toward work that is not necessarily available in a time of economic turndown, which it believes is the result of the economic incompetence of the UK Government; believes that this represents bullying tactics against vulnerable groups and individuals, and  notes that suggestions that schemes be piloted in Glasgow effectively amounts to test-bedding Glasgow in the same way as Scotland was test-bedded for the Poll Tax by the Thatcher government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3086</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Braidwood Primary Wins Gold Award for Promoting Health</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Braidwood Primary School in South Lanarkshire on being awarded the prestigious Health Promoting Schools gold award after taking part in awareness raising and healthy living initiatives to achieve this and encourages schools across Scotland to follow Braidwood&rsquo;s example and promote healthy living for all.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3085</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Save Our Forests</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposal to lease 25% of the most commercially viable, publicly-owned Scottish forests to private investment companies for up to 75 years; further notes that the 25% could equate to 40% of production for the Forestry Commission, which could significantly diminish essential income for investment in maintaining tourist activities such as the 7stanes network and for creating new leisure-access initiatives such as mountain biking, walking, orienteering and other community woodland projects; recognises the importance of Scotland&rsquo;s woods and forests and the potential for raising capital for expansion of woodland cover; considers that Forestry Commission jobs and associated jobs are under threat; recognises that timber and wood processing companies depend on security of wood supply and that Forestry Commission cutting contracts face an uncertain future if those cutting rights are taken away; urges the Scottish Government to commit to maintaining sufficient availability of wood for these industries; considers that the Scottish Government should commission a comprehensive survey of wood availability and demand, in conjunction with Forestry Commission Scotland, Forestry Commission Wales and Forestry Commission England and with the wood industries; recognises with concern the detrimental effects that this proposal could have on the Scottish landscape, economy and environment, and calls for its immediate withdrawal from the Scottish Climate Change Bill.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3084</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>School Budget Cuts Must Stop</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the creation of the Edinburgh Parent Council Network, a first class framework for parent councils across Edinburgh to support each other in their work; congratulates the network on its first publication, a dossier detailing the very concerning impact that a 1.5% efficiency saving has had on school budgets this financial year and outlining just how the proposed 2% efficiency saving would devastate each school&rsquo;s budget next year; calls on the Lib Dem/SNP council to abandon its plans for a 2% budget cut; reminds John Swinney MSP of his words in the Chamber on 20 November 2008 (<em>Official Report</em>, c. 12632) when he said &quot;What might be described as crude cuts in services can in no way pass the test for efficiency savings&quot;, and believes that the SNP government&rsquo;s historic concordat is failing Scotland&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3083</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Calling Network Rail to Account in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses disappointment and concern at the attitude and behaviour of Network Rail in dealing with local organisations and individuals in relation to its preparations for reinstating the Airdrie to Bathgate rail link; believes that its intransigence has cost local people many thousands of pounds unnecessarily in legal fees; considers that it has treated complaints with almost total disregard for the concerns of people and organisations affected by compulsory purchase orders, and calls on the Scottish Government to examine ways of making the senior management of Network Rail in Scotland more accountable for its actions in relation to individual complaints, including bringing it within the remit of the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman and the Scottish Information Commissioner.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3082</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Protecting Those Who Take a Stand Against Organised Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all who take a stand against organised crime, be they police officers, hard-pressed communities or democratically-elected politicians; condemns any attempts of organised criminals to threaten, intimidate or attack such individuals as a result of their stance against organised crime, and believes that where such incidents take place, police forces across Scotland should tackle such serious matters with a high priority.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3081</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Holding DNA Samples of Innocent People Against the Law</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the ruling from the European Court of Human Rights that those who have not been convicted of any crime should be safe in the knowledge that no DNA samples are held by any government agency for any purpose and that all people should be treated the same and notes that the court consisted of 17 judges and that the verdict was unanimous, stating that the holding by any government agency of DNA samples belonging to an innocent person is a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3080</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Withdrawal of UK Troops from Iraq</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes reports that the United Kingdom will begin to withdraw its remaining 4,100 troops from Iraq in March 2009; notes with regret that some 177 UK troops have been killed in Iraq since 2003; reiterates its belief that the decision by the United Kingdom and United States of America to go to war in Iraq without a specific UN mandate was illegal, and calls on the global community to continue working for peace and stability in Iraq and throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3079</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Financial Inclusion Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Inverclyde Council on taking the lead with the Financial Inclusions Champions Team Scotland to build up experience to roll out the scheme to other local authority areas; notes that the initiative will help guide the poorest in society to avoid the negative impact of the credit crunch; also notes that staff will work with other local authorities, social landlords and key partners to highlight better access to mainstream banking products, money advice, insurance and affordable credit, and highlights that financial education in schools will also be a priority in order to equip children with the skills and confidence that will stand them in good stead for their adult lives.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3078.1</strong> <strong>Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Kinship Care</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3078) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;to provide&quot; to end and insert &quot;to kinship carers; notes the increase of over 100% of looked-after children since 2000 who live with a kinship carer; recognises the crucial role that these carers play in supporting our most vulnerable children and that they should be supported financially at an equivalent level to foster carers; welcomes work by local authorities towards providing financial support to approved kinship carers of looked-after children using resources provided by central government and further welcomes the work of COSLA and the Association of Directors of Social Work to support the efforts of all local authorities to achieve this; calls on the Scottish Government to work constructively with the UK Government to resolve issues arising out of the interface with United Kingdom benefits legislation, and in this context notes the willingness of United Kingdom ministers to address anomalies in benefits entitlement for kinship carers.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3075.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>ScotRail Franchise</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3075) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes from the report that the original contract, negotiated by the previous Labour-led Scottish administration, &quot;did not specify the conditions under which an extension should be considered or the criteria to be used to decide whether an extension might be appropriate&quot;; believes that practice and procedures for future contract management can be improved and notes the report&rsquo;s recommendations for Transport Scotland; considers that, in light of the finding that &quot;First ScotRail was performing above its punctuality and capacity improvements targets within its first year of operating&quot; and &quot;key aspects of the original franchise contract were no longer fit for purpose&quot;, the decision to extend the contract, inserted into the original contract under the previous Labour-led Scottish administration, was on balance justifiable.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3075.2</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>ScotRail Franchise</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3075) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;requires the Scottish Government to conduct the next steps of the franchise extension process with the greatest possible transparency, and therefore calls on the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change to bring before Parliament the draft proposals on how the &pound;73.1 million accrued through the franchise extension will be reinvested to allow close scrutiny of the plans before any further funds are committed.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3075.3</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>ScotRail Franchise</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3075) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to first &quot;Transport Scotland&quot;.</p>
