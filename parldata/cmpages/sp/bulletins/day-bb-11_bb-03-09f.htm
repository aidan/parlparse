<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8120 Robert Brown: Local Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the apparently endless desire on the part of centralising national politicians to attempt to take over control of local services, witnessed by proposals on police, fire and social work; opposes the flawed proposals for a single police force, under which, for example, local control of policing will be removed from the Northern and Grampian police force areas; does not support centralisation by government assertion, where no robust costs of change are produced; believes that a single one-size-fits-all approach to social work will waste money by destroying those successful local initiatives that are already in place, and believes that the people of Scotland will be better served by a new approach from government that trusts local people to make good decisions for their areas and equips local government with the powers, levers and authority to drive innovation and improvement in local services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8119 Robert Brown: Abolition of Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the letter of 22 February 2011 from the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to the Convener of the Justice Committee stating that it was the intention of the Scottish Government to proceed with the transfer of the functions of the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland (PCCS) to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO); believes that police complaints require specific expertise and understanding for proper handling and that what it considers as the generalist experience of the SPSO is not best suited to this; further believes that effective and independent machinery for handling police complaints underlay the establishment of the PCCS in the first place, and calls for a rethink of the transfer proposal by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8118 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
<p>Groups 1 to 6: 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Supported by: Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-8117 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Referral of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011 be considered by the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8116 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees&mdash;</p>

<p><strong>6.15 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8114 Iain Gray: Scotland Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, further to motion S3M-7550 passed on 9 December 2010 supporting the general principles of the Scotland Bill as introduced in the House of Commons on 30 November 2010, the Bill be considered by the UK Parliament; invites the UK Government and the UK Parliament to consider the amendments and proposals made in the report of the Scotland Bill Committee, and looks forward to considering any amendments made to the Bill with a view to debating them in a further legislative consent motion before the Bill is passed for Royal Assent.</p>
<p>Supported by: Annabel Goldie<strong>*</strong>, Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-8113 David Stewart: Insulin Pumps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the loss of potential savings opportunities of &pound;278,000 in the procurement of insulin pumps through what appears to be mainland NHS boards, excluding Ayrshire and Arran, disregarding the guidance of NHS National Services Scotland&rsquo;s National Procurement Division&rsquo;s guidance on the preferred ranked supplier; considers that the division undertook an extensive technical and clinical assessment of the pumps prior to ranking preferred suppliers; calls for an explanation of why the mainland NHS boards seem to have failed to follow procurement guidance; urges the Scottish Executive to strengthen the requirement of NHS boards to follow national procurement guidance; is of the view that the Scottish Diabetes Action Plan sets out too modest targets for widening access to insulin pump therapy and understands that several boards have predicated their plans to widen access on expected procurement savings; believes that those NHS boards failing to follow procurement guidance have denied pumps to people on waiting lists because expected savings did not materialise; is concerned about what it believes to be the deteriorating position on widening access to pump therapy for adults in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area and calls on NHS Highland to reconsider its decision not to introduce a paediatric pump service; considers that Scotland has the second highest prevalence of type 1 diabetes in Europe but the lowest pump provision, and urges the Scottish Executive to challenge NHS boards to improve their record on widening access to insulin pump provision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8112 Margaret Mitchell: Smiths Uddingston, Restaurant of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Smiths of Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, on being named both Urban and Overall Restaurant of the Year at the Scottish Restaurant Awards 2011 ceremony held on 28 February; notes that the awards recognise outstanding creativity, customer service and top quality dining and that Smiths faced competition from Michelin Star-rated restaurants Scotland-wide; further notes that the eatery was commended by competition organisers for serving what they regarded as delicious, well presented food at a reasonable price, and congratulates owner Michael Smith and his staff on their success and achievement in gaining what is considered this prestigious award.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8111 Bob Doris: Recognising Maryhill&rsquo;s International Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the contribution that women across the world make to their communities on a daily basis; believes that International Women&rsquo;s Day is an opportunity for such contributions to be acknowledged and celebrated and believes that two such examples in Maryhill in Glasgow are Julie Love, who has been campaigning to allow the holding of fatal accident inquiries into the deaths of Scots overseas following the tragic drowning of her son, Colin, while visiting a Venezuelan island, and Julie Hyslop, who last year started what it considers a hugely successful youth club, running two evenings a week at Caldercuilt Primary School, as well as an activities programme for children from local primary schools, after Glasgow City Council was apparently unable to provide adequate provision.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong>, Joe FitzPatrick<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-8110 Richard Lochhead: Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Reservoirs (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Roseanna Cunningham<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-8109 Dr Richard Simpson: Waterwatch Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, by the casting vote of the Presiding Officer at stage three of the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill, it was decided that Waterwatch Scotland was to be terminated and its functions dispersed to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) and Consumer Focus Scotland (CFS); notes that CFS is now itself to be disbanded; understands that, although the order has not yet been laid to terminate Waterwatch Scotland, the Scottish Government has already begun to deconstruct Waterwatch Scotland with the loss of around 13 jobs in Clackmannanshire to date; further understands that ministers have requested Scottish Water, the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland and CFS to jointly work on proposals to replace some of the consumer consultation processes hitherto undertaken by Waterwatch Scotland and proposed a consumer forum at a cost of &pound;210,000 annually; understands that there are at least two remaining functions of Waterwatch Scotland, consultation on prices and consultation on investment, that have yet to be placed with other existing or new organisations; further understands that the proposed budget for the elements of Waterwatch Scotland to be disaggregated to the SPSO and CFS and this forum so far totals &pound;880,000 and the other functions yet to be decided on have not yet had budgets attached; expresses concern that the proposed budgeted costs of the dispersed elements so far exceed the maximum previous costs of Waterwatch Scotland by around &pound;130,000 or 17% and exceed the current annual costs by around &pound;275,000 or over 40%, and calls on the Scottish Government to desist from deconstructing Waterwatch Scotland until an order is laid after 28 April 2011 as required.</p>
