    </strong><p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-767#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Regeneration</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with concern recent reports highlighting the levels of ill health and
    poverty in Glasgow and the widening health gap between Glasgow and more prosperous parts
    of the country; believes that a co-ordinated strategy should be developed to tackle these
    problems and recognises that the injection of public investment is required for the
    regeneration of the city.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-766</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Pollution in Scotland from Sellafield</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that the major source of radioactive pollution found on the Scottish
    coastline is not from Scottish nuclear installations, but from Sellafield in Cumbria;
    further notes that in testing for pollution in the sea off East Lothian, more man-made
    radioactivity can be attributed to Sellafield discharges than to the Torness nuclear
    generating station there; believes that it is unacceptable that the entire length of the
    Scottish coastline should be polluted in this way by the BNFL plant in Cumbria and
    therefore joins with the international community, including Iceland, Denmark and Ireland
    in calling for an end to reprocessing at Sellafield.</p>

    Parliament supports a request from the major environment and conservation organisations,
    including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,
    the Wildlife Trusts and the World Wide Fund for Nature, to safeguard the most important
    area in Europe for whales, dolphins and coral reefs, and prevent extreme climate change,
    and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s
    Government to stop new oil drilling activity in the Atlantic frontier west of Scotland,
    and to create a new industry in offshore wind and wave power.<strong><i> R</i></strong></p><strong>

    and women fought and lost their lives during the UN deployment to Korea in 1950-53 and
    urges that the tragedy of the war not be forgotten.</p>
