<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;    ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4217</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Establishment of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to establish a committee of the Parliament as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Name of Committee: Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill Committee;<br />
    Remit: To consider and report to the Parliament on the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill;<br />
    Duration: Until the Bill has received Royal Assent, falls or is withdrawn; <br />
    Convenership: The Convener will be a member of the Labour Party and the Deputy Convener will be a member of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party; <br />
    Membership: Christine Grahame, Jamie McGrigor, Iain Smith, Scott Barrie, Mr Charlie Gordon.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4216</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>The Spiralling Cost of the Nuclear Clean-Up</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great concern the news that the clean-up cost for existing nuclear facilities is set to rise by &pound;9 billion to &pound;65 billion; believes that this highlights that nuclear power is expensive as well as dangerous and dirty; considers that Scotland has no need for new nuclear power stations which, according to the UK Government-appointed Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, if built, would produce radioactive waste nine times stronger than currently exists and will cost billions of pounds to both build and clean up, and also believes that we should reject Labour&rsquo;s nuclear ambitions, while promoting clean and safe energy technologies with which Scotland has the potential to lead the world.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4215</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with Local Government Workers in Their Fight to Defend Their Pensions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the trade unions and their members for having the courage and strength to stand up to government attacks on their contractual pension rights and entitlements; admires the show of solidarity displayed by over 200,000 workers in Scotland and over one million more across Britain; regrets that the actions of the Scottish Executive and the Westminster Government have led to strike action being necessary; believes that the Executive should reconsider its stance on the legal position of the Rule of 85, given the conflicting advice from COSLA and UNISON and the contradictory statements of the Westminster Government; further believes that the Executive should reconsider its position in relation to ensuring that local government workers suffer no detriment in terms of their pension rights or entitlements; considers that, as a matter of urgency, the Executive should publish its proposals for resolution of this dispute, whether or not the Westminster Government approves, and believes that the only fair and just way to settle this dispute is for the Executive and employers to offer a solution acceptable to local government trade union members.</p>
<p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4214</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Caledonia Youth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret that decisions by NHS Greater Glasgow and NHS Tayside have resulted in the closure of Caledonia Youth clinics and sexual health education and advice services, first in Glasgow and now in Dundee; further notes that these services have been widely praised, including by HM Inspectorate of Education, as providing much-needed individual support to young people facing unplanned pregnancy, relationship problems and issues of sexuality and low self-esteem and proving successful in reducing such problems among Caledonia Youth&rsquo;s clients, and urges the Scottish Executive and the Parliament to show that they take seriously the Executive&rsquo;s national sexual health strategy, Respect and Responsibility, by ensuring that Caledonia Youth is sustained financially and allowed to contribute towards the national policy.</p>
