    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-503</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Drug Addiction in Glasgow</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that drug addiction in Glasgow is five times higher than anywhere in
    Britain; recognises that such high levels of drug addiction have pushed drugs services in
    the City to breaking point; notes that social workers in Glasgow are having to work under
    unbearable pressure, given that the number of problem drug users in the City has almost
    doubled in nine years; notes the result of a recent survey, which suggests that one in
    thirty of Glasgow&#146;s adults are now drug addicts and that there are between 12,419 and
    15,368 problem drug users in the city and also reveals that more than 4,000 adults who
    have been treated by 13 social work projects have dependent children amounting to almost
    1,000 youngsters, and believes that, given the serious and grave problem drug using
    situation within the City of Glasgow, special extra resources must be diverted from the
    Scottish Executive&#146;s drug enforcement project to allow the City of Glasgow to spend
    more on drug prevention and treatment.</p>

    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-500#</b> <strong>Brian Adam: Attacks on Elderly People in Aberdeen</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament expresses its concern at the number of senseless attacks on elderly
    residents in Aberdeen in recent months; condemns the perpetrators of these crimes for
    their callousness, and welcomes the campaign being run by the Aberdeen <i>Evening Express</i>
    which highlights the issue by informing pensioners how they can protect themselves and
