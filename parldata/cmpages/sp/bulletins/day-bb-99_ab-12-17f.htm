    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-392</b> <strong>Michael Russell: Agricultural Business Improvement Scheme</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament welcomes the report published today by the Rural Affairs Committee on the
    original and revised ABIS schemes; expresses its concern that there are still around 4000
    outstanding applications which, under European rules, will fall if not approved before 31
    December 1999; notes that the rules of the revised scheme required applicants in many
    cases to undertake considerable expenditure in order to meet the approved criteria;
    accepts the conclusion of the Rural Affairs Committee that the Executive must honour the
    commitment made in February 1999 by a pre-devolution minister for agriculture to fund all
    eligible applications, and therefore calls upon the Minister for Rural Affairs to seek
    from Her Majesty's Government sufficient funds to meet all eligible applications, for all
    approvals to be made by 31 December 1999 and by so doing to accept the moral obligation
    that the Executive must carry in this matter given the previous commitment by a Labour
    Minister for Agriculture in the former Scottish Office.</p>
