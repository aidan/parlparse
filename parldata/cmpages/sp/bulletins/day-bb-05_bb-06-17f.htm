          <p><strong>*S2M-2984</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>United Kingdom&rsquo;s First Legal Humanist Marriage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the fact that on Saturday 18 June 2005 Scotland will see the first legal marriage to be conducted in the United Kingdom by a humanist celebrant; commends the decision by the Registrar General for Scotland to authorise 12 such celebrants to conduct civil marriages in Scotland; congratulates the Humanist Society of Scotland for its work in campaigning over many years for this change; considers that non-religious people wishing to mark their commitment to one another through marriage should enjoy the right to do so in keeping with their philosophical beliefs, and wishes the couple, Karen Watts and Martin Reins, every possible joy on this happy occasion.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2983</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Ayrshire and Arran Alcohol and Drug Action Team Drug Death Review Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Ayrshire and Arran Alcohol and Drug Action Team (ADAT) Drug Death Review Group, led by Detective Superintendent Stephen Heath, on receiving the Best Team Award at the COSLA excellence awards; recognises the success of ADAT in reducing the number of drug deaths in Ayrshire and Arran, and welcomes the collaborative working of the partners to achieve this recognition.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2982</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Scotland Supporting the Right to Die at Home</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that every patient who chooses to die at home should be given the opportunity to do so; congratulates Marie Curie Cancer Care on its campaign, &quot;Scotland Supporting the Choice to Die at Home&quot;; notes the survey by YouGov, commissioned by the charity, which found that 75 per cent of Scots would choose to die at home and the Scottish parliamentary survey, carried out by Marie Curie Cancer Care, which found that 73 per cent of Scottish parliamentarians would also like to die at home; recognises that at present only 24 per cent of terminally ill cancer patients are able to die at home; further notes the economic paper commissioned by the charity which shows that caring for more patients at home would release funds which could be used elsewhere in the NHS, and urges the Scottish Executive to publicly support patients&rsquo; rights to choose where they die by ensuring that this choice is available and achievable across Scotland&rsquo;s NHS boards.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2981</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>London Assembly Rejects ID Cards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the London Assembly for passing a motion proposed by the Green Party group condemning ID cards; notes that this motion was tabled during a formal meeting with Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, who admitted that questions remain unanswered over the effectiveness of ID card technology, and calls on the UK Government to scrap its proposals for an identity card scheme.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-2980</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Upholding Rights at G8</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the democratic right of people to express their opinion peacefully during the G8 summit at Gleneagles and the rights of local people in the area to go about their everyday lives; believes that protesters will inevitably come to voice their concerns close to the G8 summit; believes, therefore, that facilities should be provided for those coming to the area, including the provision of an authorised march as close to Gleneagles Hotel as is safely possible; further believes that neither the rights of local people in the Auchterarder area nor peaceful protesters are being well served by the proposals for a static rally in Auchterarder park or the refusal to allow a march past Gleneagles Hotel grounds, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to enter into urgent dialogue with all relevant bodies to achieve a resolution that upholds these rights.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-2977#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>50 Years of Chapelcross</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that it is 50 years since the plans for the construction of Chapelcross power station in Annan were lodged; notes also that over its 45 years of power generation it produced enough electricity to power all homes in Dumfries and Galloway for 200 years and contributed an estimated &pound;18 million per annum to the local economy; congratulates the workforce, past and present, for the safe operation of the power station, and looks forward to future developments on the Chapelcross site.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2976</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Berries on the Menu</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish fruit promotion group, Berry Scotland, based at Dundee University, who will be delivering 7,000 punnets of locally grown strawberries to schools throughout Scotland as part of the Berries on the Menu programme; commends all the major berry-growing areas of Scotland for taking part and providing this tangible link between fruit grown in local fields and meals offered to the pupils; notes with interest that the popularity of the scheme with schoolchildren has seen a reported increase in school meal uptake of 10 to 15 per cent over the last two years; believes that all children should have access to healthy, locally sourced school meals, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that such meals are available to all Scottish schoolchildren as part of its Hungry for Success programme.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-2975</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Stage 3 of Major Bills</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the problems caused by not enough time being allocated to Stage 3 debates on major bills, resulting in important amendments not being properly debated, members not being called, or believing they will not be called and not seeking to speak, and ministers and members not being able to clarify controversial issues as promised at Stage 2, and urges the parliamentary authorities to provide enough time for full democratic scrutiny of bills at Stage 3.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2967#</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> <strong>Supporting School Science</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the comments of Scotland&rsquo;s only living Nobel Prize winner, Sir James Black, reported in <em>The Scotsman</em> on 14 March 2005, regarding the need to attract more people to study science; further notes the findings of the Save British Science Society survey on Scottish secondary school science which found that more than half of Scotland&rsquo;s schools are cancelling practical lessons in science subjects; *notes that a recent Royal Society of Chemistry survey found that over one in five Scottish local authority schools have turned away pupils from chemistry courses due to a lack of chemistry teachers*; notes that funding schools directly from the centre would reduce bureaucracy and free up funds for schools to use for investing in subjects in high demand; supports the *Scottish Schools Equipment Research Centre, which is* working with science teachers to support excellence in science teaching throughout Scotland with the aim of reversing the decline in the popularity of science at schools, colleges and universities, and considers that the Scottish Executive should support and encourage further collaboration with, and sponsorship from, research institutes and the science industry sector to maximise the incentives for young people to study science and to secure the future of science in Scotland.</p>
