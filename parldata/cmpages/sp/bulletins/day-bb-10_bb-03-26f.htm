                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6071 Mike Pringle: Congratulations to Liberton High School and its Head Teacher, Donald Macdonald</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Liberton High School and its head teacher, Donald Macdonald, in the vast improvement evident at the school since Donald first took charge in June 2005; notes that, following its most recent inspection in 2009, HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) described Liberton High as the most improved school in Scotland; further notes that, in 2009, 52 pupils from the school attended university, an increase from only seven who attended in 2005 when HMIE deemed overall school attainment unsatisfactory; considers this incredible improvement to be a just reward for all the hard work put in by the pupils, teachers, staff and parents at Liberton High in turning the school around, and wishes Liberton High and Donald Macdonald every success in the future as it continues to improve.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6070 Sarah Boyack: Boroughmuir High&rsquo;s Quiz Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils of Boroughmuir High School on winning the Scottish Young Consumer of the Year competition; notes that the worthy winners were Boroughmuir pupils Imogen Ross, Elspie Horne, Alice Mackenzie and team captain Douglas Boubert, and considers their excellent knowledge and skill to be a credit to both the individual pupils and teachers involved and to the whole school.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6069 Liam McArthur: Sudden End to Home Renewables Grant and Home Loans Schemes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision to bring forward the deadline for applications under the change to the Energy Saving Scotland (ESS) home renewables grant and home loans schemes without consultation or warning will unfairly penalise the very many innovative individuals looking to take forward microrenewables projects; is concerned that the way in which grants were removed and loans reduced under the ESS schemes risks undermining public confidence in schemes of this type in the future, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider how applicants and prospective applicants affected by the premature closure of the scheme can be helped.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6068 Jackie Baillie: Obama Health Reforms Welcome</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates US President Barack Obama and the US House of Representatives for the successful passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which will bring substantial reform to health care in America; welcomes the ending of pre-existing condition exclusions for health insurance coverage; further welcomes the extension of insurance to all low-income groups; warmly acknowledges the improved access and inclusion of more individuals and families in the US health care system, and, in doing so, celebrates the NHS in Scotland and across the United Kingdom, where health care remains free at the point of need.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6067 John Swinney: Forth Crossing Bill - Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Forth Crossing Bill, agrees to any expenditure of a kind referred to in Rules 9C.16.3(b)(ii) and (iii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6066 Helen Eadie: Fair Fares for Fifers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is dismayed to learn that Fife Council is increasing by 1,340% the concessionary rail fares for all Fife senior citizens who, it is considered, have over many years benefited enormously from the previous Labour-controlled administration&rsquo;s policy of 50p journeys to Glasgow, Edinburgh or Dundee in Fife; considers that, in many instances, this will mean that pensioners will have to severely limit their contact with the close family in these cities and face insurmountable costs of travel to the major hospitals for outpatient treatment or visits to patients, and hopes that the council will reverse this monumentally wrong decision and restore this policy that is the envy of pensioners across other parts of Scotland and that this policy may be rolled out right across Scotland, furthering the sustainability of public transport while at the same time recognising that, in the majority of cases, all those disabled people who are unable to mount the steps of intercity coaches find the relatively easy access of trains a major boon to making travel much easier for them.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6065 Willie Coffey: Rathbone Achievers Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all of the winners in this year&rsquo;s Rathbone Scotland Achievers of the Year 2010 awards, including young achievers Emily Paterson from Kilmarnock, Liam Murray and Lisa Keogh from Dundee, Thomas Hodge from Fife and Jake Duncanson from Edinburgh, Rathbone&rsquo;s Employee and Volunteer of the Year, Niki Gray and Junior Robertson, respectively, and employers Arnold Clark of Dundee and Johnston Brown of Glasgow; recognises the achievement of the young award-winners who have overcome difficult circumstances to build a positive future for themselves; believes that the commitment of Rathbone&rsquo;s staff and volunteers plays a vital role in helping these young people succeed; notes the importance of Rathbone&rsquo;s partnerships with employers in providing young people with the opportunity to progress, and wishes Rathbone every success in continuing to improve the life chances of young people in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-6064 Stuart McMillan: Able2Sail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the work carried out by Able2Sail; notes that Able2Sail is a volunteer-run charity based in Inverkip Marina that provides free sailing to any disabled people, the families of disabled people and armed forces veterans; further notes the charity&rsquo;s central belief that every individual should have the opportunity to sail a modern yacht; commends Able2Sail on its excellent work in the community, and wishes it every success in the future.</p>
