<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-272</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>HMIE Report on Services for Children of Asylum Seekers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the HM Inspectorate of Education report, <em>Joint Inspection of services for children of asylum seekers in the Glasgow City Council area</em>; welcomes the recognition of the good work done by staff to meet the needs of children of asylum seekers and their parents and the strong leadership shown across the partner services; recognises the considerable challenges to children&rsquo;s services in this field; supports ongoing work towards achieving the improvements identified in the report, and believes that the Scottish Executive should respond to aspirations among asylum seeker children to undertake degree level studies, as identified in the HMIE report.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-271</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>SPL Call for Lifting of Alcohol Ban for Football Fans</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent decision to lift a ban on alcohol sales at Murrayfield Stadium for rugby fans in time for the Rugby World Cup; expresses concern that proposals have not been brought forward for a similar trial scheme for football; believes that football fans in Scotland should be treated with the same level of respect as rugby fans; notes the many successful football events that have been held in recent years at Hampden, such as the Champions League and UEFA Cup finals, and supports the calls from the Scottish Premier League for a pilot scheme lifting the ban on alcohol sales in Scottish football grounds to be introduced as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-270</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Sing When You&rsquo;re Winning</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dumfries Area Choir of the National Youth Choir of Scotland on its achievement of performing at the Session Three official opening of the Scottish Parliament; recognises the hard work and dedication of the choir members and organisers, and notes the benefits in terms of breadth of experience, confidence and social interaction which the choir gives its young people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-269</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>The Future of Scotland - Scotland&rsquo;s Young People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that more time and effort must be dedicated to improving opportunities for young people in Scotland; believes that young people should have genuine access to power and a clear set of rights; further believes that young people have much to offer in public life and therefore young people require proper representation in national and local decision-making; notes the importance of youth work and services for young people and the need to improve access to a range of core services, and therefore believes that these measures should be put on a statutory footing in a Future of Scotland Bill to help young people to meet their potential.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Iain Smith<strong>*</strong>, Jim Tolson<strong>*</strong>, Alison McInnes<strong>*</strong>, John Farquhar Munro<strong>*</strong>, Nicol Stephen<strong>*</strong></p>

<p><strong>S3M-267</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Fundo Mhura, Scotland&rsquo;s Brightest Boxing Prospect</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that Fundo Mhura, one of Scotland&rsquo;s brightest boxing prospects, missed out on the chance of representing Scotland at the 2006 Commonwealth Games and now risks missing the chance of selection for Team GB in the coming Olympic Games due to delays in processing his request for citizenship, despite having lived in Scotland since the age of five months and other members of his family being naturalised, and calls on the UK Government to deal urgently with his application.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-266</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Ticket Prices for France v Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the ticket prices of &pound;41 and &pound;82 being imposed on the fans of the Scottish national football side for its upcoming European Championship qualifying match against France in Paris and, given that these prices are far in excess of those applied to the previous fixture in Glasgow, asks the Scottish Football Association to engage with the French Football Federation to look at this again and to apply pricing that is reasonable for the average, loyal football supporter.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-250&diams; </strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Positive Behaviour Orders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, while recognising the real need to tackle antisocial behaviour, shares the concern expressed by many young people and organisations that antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) can unnecessarily focus on the negative behaviour of young people at the expense of the many positive attitudes young people have and actions they take; agrees with many official organisations in Glasgow and throughout Scotland which regard ASBOs as a route to be explored only after other, more positive, initiatives have been tried, one such initiative being the use of positive social behaviour orders (PoSBOs), which have recently been introduced in Yorkshire for young people who make communities brighter and better places, and believes that initiatives like the one above should be explored along with others to tackle the problem of antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-239</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>End Fuel Poverty by 2016</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that all types of household are susceptible to fuel poverty, but particularly pensioner and lone-parent households; notes Scottish Executive figures published earlier this year showing that 419,000 Scottish households are in fuel poverty; recognises the crucial role that the central heating and Warm Deal programmes have played in delivering thousands of vulnerable individuals out of fuel poverty in the last eight years; however recognises the concern of key stakeholders that more needs to be done to tackle fuel poverty, and calls for urgent action to meet the 2016 target to abolish fuel poverty in Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Hume</p>
<p><strong>S3M-238</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Paisley Victoria Cross Memorial Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the ceremony to be held on 26 June 2007 in Paisley Abbey, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the first award of the Victoria Cross, to unveil a memorial in honour of the five recipients of this medal who came from Paisley; notes that Paisley is thought to have the highest concentration of Victoria Cross winners of any town in the world; further notes its gratitude for the sacrifices made by these men and their comrades, and sends its respects to the representatives, relatives and regiments of the men and to others who represented the Paisley area with such distinction.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-237</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Rural Fuel Discount Scheme Amendment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the disproportionately high cost of fuel in the remote and rural parts of Scotland where cars are a necessity not a luxury; further notes the undue burden that this puts on the social and economic life of these areas and calls on the Scottish Executive to indicate its support for the &quot;rural fuel discount scheme&quot; amendment to the UK Government&rsquo;s Finance Bill to benefit people in remote areas by allowing fuel duty be cut by up to 2.4 pence per litre, which is in line with EU law and already used in rural France, Portugal and Greece, but not in the UK, and believes that this would make a real difference to people in rural areas who face high fuel costs, greater driving distances and little or no public transport.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-236</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Devolved Fuel Duty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the right held by the French government to vary fuel duty under certain circumstances; notes that this policy could lead to cuts in fuel duty of up to 3% in rural areas; considers this to be a valuable means of alleviating a proportion of the financial burden on rural drivers who often rely on private transport to access essential services, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consult the other devolved legislatures with a view to presenting a case in favour of this policy to the UK Government.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn</p>
<p><strong>S3M-235</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>RNID Report, Here to be Heard, on Information for Hearing Aid Users</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the report<em>, Here to be Heard,</em> by Glasgow Caledonian University on behalf of RNID and, in particular, its key findings that only half of hearing aid users believed that they had received enough instruction on how to use their aids before being fitted and that three-quarters felt that this would have been useful; supports the empowerment of well-informed patients who can manage their own health needs, and believes that NHS Scotland should carry out a full evaluation on how the needs of new hearing aid users can best be met.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-234</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Social Aspect of Bingo Clubs and VAT</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the important social aspect that bingo clubs provide in local communities; notes that they provide a safe environment and are sometimes the sole outlet for communication for some people, many of whom are elderly women; notes that the Bingo Association was supportive of the smoking ban in Scotland but observes that this has contributed to a serious decline in attendance and profits; further notes that the industry is subject to the imposition of 17.5% VAT, while its immediate competitors in bookmaking and casinos are not, and suggests that the VAT taken by HM Treasury should be removed or significantly reduced in order to level the playing field, facilitate the survival of the industry and prevent further closures of bingo clubs in local communities across Scotland.</p>
