          <p><strong>*S1M-4005</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: William Symington 
            and the Charlotte Dundas</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            that 28 March 2003 marks the bicentenary of the birth of steam transport; 
            further recognises that this is the anniversary of an event that took 
            place in Scotland; notes that, on 28 March 1803, the voyage of William 
            Symington&#146;s steam tug <em>Charlotte Dundas</em>, towing the sloops 
            <em>Active</em> and <em>Euphemia</em> on the Forth and Clyde Canal 
            from Castlecary to Port Dundas in Glasgow, was an event of immense 
            significance for the world; is aware that the anniversary of the birth 
            of steam transport in the United States of America, which took place 
            more than four years later, is already being prepared for and will 
            be celebrated in major style; considers that the completion of the 
            three-quarters model of the <em>Charlotte Dundas</em>, parts of which 
            are in Falkirk museum, would be a useful and positive start to commemorating 
            both William Symington and the bicentenary, greatly complement the 
            modern engineering achievement that is the Millennium Wheel at Falkirk 
            and enhance and promote Scotland as a place of engineering excellence 
            and the cradle of the industrial revolution, and, therefore, given 
            the Scottish Executive's support for publicly commemorating other 
            historic anniversaries, calls on the First Minister to respond speedily 
            and positively to the letter on this matter that was sent to him by, 
            amongst others, Professor Christopher Smout, Professor Tom Devine, 
            Professor W Hamish Fraser, Professor Ted Cowan, Professor Christopher

            Book Day 6 March 2003</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3989) 
            in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out 
            from &quot;the greatest&quot; to end and insert "whose literary contribution 
            to world culture was immense; further notes the immense contribution 
            of other great writers from these islands who are almost too numerous 
            to mention but who, in terms of international significance, must include 
            Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Oscar Wilde, Seamus Heaney, W B Yeats, 
            Dylan Thomas, Thomas Hardy, Charles Dickens and a vast number of others 
            living and dead; celebrates all those who wrote, and continue to write, 
            in the different languages of these islands and in many different 
            genres; particularly remembers Sorley MacLean, one of the great European 
            poets of the 20th century, who wrote in Gaelic, and Hugh MacDairmid, 
            who wrote in Scots as well as in English; welcomes the contribution 
            that World Book Day makes to an understanding of the importance of 
            literature to our cultures and the way in which it can foster an appreciation 
            of other perspectives on our world and thereby develop an international 
            outlook in children as well as in adults; congratulates those modern 
            Scottish, English, Welsh and Irish writers who were mentioned in the 
            various shortlists compiled for World Book Day and, in particular, 
            Matthew Fitt, whose ground-breaking novel in Scots featured on the 
            BBC Radio 4 shortlist and Des Dillon, whose novel <em>Me and Ma Gal</em> 
            was voted the book that said most about Scotland in the actual World 
            Book Day poll, and encourages all those involved in politics, education 
            and culture in Scotland to maintain and develop a generous and wide-ranging 
            view of literature and resist any narrow, ill-informed and ideological 
            perspectives which can only distort true critical appreciation of 
            creativity.&quot; </a> </p>
