That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </p>

         <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

         <p><strong> * S2M-2578 Tommy Sheridan:Bank of Scotland Earnings Survey and Low Pay Across Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the Bank of Scotland earnings survey, released on 5 March 2005, which claimed that the lowest weekly earnings in Scotland are in Moray at an average of &pound;390 per week; believes that this survey is wildly optimistic and unrealistic as the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, the most reliable earnings survey across the United Kingdom, shows that the lowest average weekly wage in Scotland is just &pound;291 per week in the Borders; further believes that the Bank of Scotland survey disguises massively the extent of low pay across Scotland because the lowest-paid tenth of Scottish workers, according to more reliable surveys, earn less than &pound;109 per week which is more than &pound;280 less than the lowest figure quoted by the Bank of Scotland, and believes that a company with the massive resources of the Bank of Scotland should be able to conduct more reliable surveys instead of presenting a picture of Scotland among workers which is completely unrecognisable and unrelated to reality.</p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2577 Tommy Sheridan:Comments of Republican Member of Congress About Syria&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament condemns the comments of Republican member of Congress, Sam Johnson, on 19 February 2005 when he was quoted as saying, &ldquo;Syria is the problem. Syria is where those Weapons of Mass Destruction are, in my view. You know, I can fly an F-15, put two nukes on &lsquo;em and I&rsquo;ll make one pass. We don&rsquo;t have to worry about Syria any more&rdquo;; believes that such comments are not only irresponsible but inhumane in relation to the deployment of nuclear weapons which are illegal and barbaric in that they kill indiscriminately; believes that this member of Congress should be roundly condemned across the world for making such comments, and believes that the Republican Party should seek his immediate resignation from Congress and, if he refuses to resign, should expel him forthwith.</p>

         <p> <strong>S2M-2550 Mr Brian Monteith:Stirling Council&rsquo;s Neglect of Stirling&rsquo;s Roads&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the recent Accounts Commission report, <em>Stirling Council - The Audit of Best Value and Community Planning</em>, which states: &ldquo;The Council&rsquo;s road network is in a serious state of disrepair following years of under-investment. Stirling is one of only four councils where more than 20% of the roads network has deteriorated to a point at which it needs resurfacing to prolong future life. The Council has chosen to spend less than half its GAE allocation on roads maintenance. This makes it one of only three councils spending such a small amount&rdquo;; further notes that previous reports, <em>Maintaining Scotland&rsquo;s roads</em> by Audit Scotland and the Scottish Road Maintenance Condition survey for 2003-04 carried out by consultant engineers for the Society of Chief Officers of Transport also found Stirling&rsquo;s roads to be in an unacceptable state and that Stirling Council&rsquo;s own residents&rsquo; survey in 2002 showed that 58% of those taking part were dissatisfied with the level of roads servicing; understands that Stirling Council has chosen to spend less than half its GAE allocation on roads maintenance and that, while the sum Stirling Council has allocated in 2004-05 for roads maintenance is &pound;2.3 million, the council itself has estimated that returning Stirling&rsquo;s roads network to an average condition would cost in excess of &pound;13 million, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that Stirling Council&rsquo;s Labour administration addresses its neglect of Stirling&rsquo;s roads as a matter of urgency.</p>
