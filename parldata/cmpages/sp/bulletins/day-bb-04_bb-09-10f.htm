          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1674#</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Development and Manufacture of Renewable Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Highlands and Islands Renewable Energy Group and the trade union Amicus on their initiative to promote the development and manufacture of renewable energy structures, whether for wind, wave or tidal power, in the Highlands and Islands; recognises that there is a skilled engineering workforce available locally; further recognises the considerable socio-economic benefits that would flow from this work to the nearby communities; believes that renewable energy infrastructure would be better supported by these communities if they perceived that it was bringing local economic benefit, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should do all it can to support Highland-based companies in bidding for renewables contracts in Scotland and elsewhere.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1673#</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Dying with Dignity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the commencement of the select committee of the House of Lords&rsquo; consideration of physician-assisted dying and euthanasia; further acknowledges the publication of an NOP opinion poll that showed that 82% of respondents in Scotland favour a change in the law to permit people with an incurable terminal illness close to death to seek help to die with dignity; is concerned that 39% of respondents in Scotland said that they would break the law if a loved one who became terminally ill and was suffering unbearably asked them to help them die; recognises the huge benefit to society and individuals of professionals, volunteers and carers working in palliative care and the hospice movement who work tirelessly with compassion and commitment but recognises that there are some people who will not be helped and that they will seek the right to die with dignity, and calls for a wide debate on end of life issues and consideration of a change in the law.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1672</strong> <strong>Des McNulty on behalf of the Finance Committee:</strong> <strong>Relocation of Public Sector Jobs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 6th Report 2004 (Session 2) of the Finance Committee, <em>Report on the Relocation of Public Sector Jobs </em>(SP Paper 189), which summarises the considerable evidence in support of the principle of relocation of public sector jobs, calls for greater transparency in the decision-making process associated with relocation, highlights the need for the objectives of the policy to be set out clearly and realistically, identifies lessons to be learnt from elsewhere and puts forward a number of recommendations for consideration and debate.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1671</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.8) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.8) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/344) be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1670</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.9) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.9) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/359) be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1669</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (Orkney) (No.3) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (Orkney) (No.3) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/352) be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1668</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Diarrhetic Shellfish Poison) (East Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/378) be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1667</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Support for a Moratorium on NHS Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the succession of profound concerns expressed in debates and motions on the NHS; further notes that these concerns are so serious that calls for a moratorium on NHS closures and centralisations have been made for over a year; notes that communities remain at odds with NHS boards and the Scottish Executive over the future of the NHS, that NHS boards implement Executive policy and budgets, notably on PFI/PPP, that boards do not play any political role in terms of PFI/PPP or pharmaceutical profits which represent a massive strain on their budgets, that the application of the working time regulations have neither been planned properly nor budgeted for, that new contracts for medical staff at all levels have not been fully funded and that numbers of graduates in all health professions have been, and are, consistently insufficient to meet the needs of patients or a 21st century NHS; believes that NHS boards should be democratically accountable for their responsibilities but that it is the Executive that sets the structural, strategic, financial and political context that they operate in and regrets the failure of the Executive to acknowledge that responsibility or engage in a debate with the public; further believes that the threat of closure of so many important facilities is entrenching the disengagement between communities and government, and therefore believes that the Executive should now announce a moratorium so that a wide-ranging and meaningful debate about the security and future of the NHS can take place in Scotland.</P>
