              of Ettrick and Yarrow Parish</p>
            <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
            <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Debate on the Scottish Economy- </p>
            <p><em>&#9;</em><strong>S1M-4057</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong>

              the Scottish Executive's policy to increase the sustainable growth 
              of Scotland's economy over the long term as set out in <em>Smart, 
              Successful Scotland</em> and believes that this, along with the 
              investment in Scottish transport infrastructure outlined in <em>Building 
              Better Transport</em> and the introduction of education for work 
              and enterprise for every pupil at every stage of school to create 
              a culture of aspiration and entrepreneurship, will deliver increased 
              prosperity, thus providing resources for first-class public services 
              and a more socially just and sustainable Scotland</p>

                  and insert &quot;believes that a dramatic improvement on the 
                  underperformance of the Scottish economy should be the top priority 
                  of Scotland's leaders and calls for all parties to work together 
                  to place growth and competitiveness at the top of our national 
                  agenda; supports initiatives such as set out in <em>Smart, Successful 
                  Scotland </em>and effective investment in infrastructure and 
                  skills improvement but believes more must be done to deliver 
                  maximum growth and a competitive advantage for the Scottish 
                  economy; calls on all parties to support positive reform of 
                  the Scottish Enterprise network and a reduction in Scottish 
                  business rates to below the United Kingdom rate in the course 
                  of the next session of the Parliament, and believes that the 
                  optimal policy to release Scotland's full economic potential 
                  requires the Scottish government to be equipped with the same 
                  competitive policy tools as Scotland's independent competitors 
                  focussed on delivering the maximum possible competitive advantage

                  and, while welcoming the introduction of education for work 
                  and enterprise within Scottish schools, expresses concern that, 
                  at the end of the first devolved parliamentary session, business 
                  start-ups have declined, business regulation has intensified, 
                  strategic transport investment has been neglected and business 
                  rates have increased, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
                  to recreate a competitive business environment by increasing 
                  the annual transport budget by £100 million, cutting the business 
                  rate poundage to the level of England and taking pro-active 
                  steps to reduce the burden of red tape on Scottish business.&quot;</p>

              footballing merit rather than arbitrarily set criteria that discriminate 
              against clubs of modest means and therefore believes that the Scottish

              of the Scottish Football League are given the opportunity of promotion 
              to the Scottish Premier League provided they have guaranteed use
