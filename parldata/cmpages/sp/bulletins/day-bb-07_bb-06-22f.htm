<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>(<a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm</a>).

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-229</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Don&rsquo;t Give Fire A Home</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 20 individuals lost their lives in alcohol-related fires in 2006; acknowledges that the careless use of cigarettes, lighters, matches and the preparation of food while intoxicated are the main causes of these fatalities; further notes that the most likely group of people to start a fire while intoxicated is men aged 30 to 59, and supports the ongoing Don&rsquo;t Give Fire a Home campaign which seeks to reduce fire deaths and injuries by raising public awareness of fire risks in the home.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-228</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Women and Human Trafficking</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its continuing deep concern about the number of women who, falling victim to trafficking, are brought to Scotland and forced to work in our growing illegal sex trade; notes that more than 6,000 foreign women are already believed to be here through this route, many living a miserable existence as virtual prisoners of the criminal gangs who brought them to Scotland with promises of a new and better life, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work closely with the UK Government to ensure a well-resourced and co-ordinated inter-agency approach to ending sex slavery in Scotland and to provide to the women affected every possible chance to rescue themselves from those who would exploit them.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alex Neil<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-227</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Scottish Bowel Screening Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme which will invite all men and women in Scotland between the ages of 50 to 74 for screening every two years; recognises that the programme is now being phased in across Scotland and by the end of 2009 will be available in all NHS board areas, and considers however that the screening programme should be extended to include the children of bowel cancer sufferers under the age of 50.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-226</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Success of Nicolson Institute Debating Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the debating team from the Nicolson Institute, Stornoway, which won the Big Green Challenge competition, involving 34 schools in the Highlands and Islands, and recognises that this is a superb achievement for the school, but especially for the three members of the team.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-225</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Sleepout</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament extends its full support to the sleepout on 21 June 2007 in George Square, Glasgow, and other sleepouts throughout the rest of the United Kingdom during the summer as part of the Still Human Still Here campaign which aims to highlight the destitution that many asylum seekers find themselves in as a result of policies designed to force them out of the country; agrees with the recommendations of the campaign which call on the UK Government to end the threat and use of destitution as a tool of government policy against refused asylum seekers, to continue financial support and accommodation to refused asylum seekers as provided during the asylum process, to grant permission to work until such time as they have left the UK or been granted leave to remain and to continue to provide full access to health care and education throughout the same period, and believes that these sleepout events are invaluable in highlighting the terrible plight that many asylum seekers find themselves in and maintaining the necessary pressure required to force a much-needed review of overall asylum policy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-224</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Blair, Middle East Envoy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes reports of a discussion between outgoing UK Prime Minister Blair, US President Bush and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about the former becoming a Middle East envoy; believes that the policies supported by the three thus far have, by and large, only promoted peace in that troubled region in the sense of the Orwellian slogan &quot;War is Peace&quot;, and accordingly wishes Mr Blair well in a role that would require him to undo the damage done by the UK&rsquo;s and USA&rsquo;s invasion of Iraq and their markedly selective support of democracy, human rights and United Nations resolutions in the Middle East.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-223</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Scottish Under-20 Football Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish under-20 football team will be taking part in the under-20 World Cup finals in Canada in July 2007; congratulates the squad on the momentous achievement of reaching the finals as one of the few European teams at the world cup; further congratulates the Scotland coach, Tommy Wilson, for his inspirational training and success in building on the excellent performance of the under-19 team at the 2006 under-19 European Championships, and wishes the whole Scottish team every success in its matches in Canada in July.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-222</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Welcome for the Cervical Cancer Vaccine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to recommend a new vaccination programme against the human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for around 70% of cases of cervical cancer; further welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s proposals to introduce this vaccination for girls aged 12 to 13 by autumn 2008; notes with concern that almost 3,000 women are diagnosed with and 1,000 women die from cervical cancer in the United Kingdom each year; recognises the huge long-term benefits to be had though vaccination not only in reducing deaths but in also reducing the number of colposcopies, reducing the number of abnormal smears and reducing the number of people requiring treatment for genital warts; also recognises however that the vaccine will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer; therefore believes that the cervical cancer screening programme should be continued and that further action should be taken to increase the take-up of screening in more deprived areas, among ethnic minority groups and among women with learning difficulties; further believes that this will improve early detection and allow earlier treatment of this disease, and welcomes the work of charities such as Jo&rsquo;s Trust, Cancerbackup and Cancer Research UK, among others, in supporting patients with cervical cancer and their families and in counselling the thousands more women who worry about their health following an abnormal smear result.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-221</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Polls Apart 5 Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the contents of Capability Scotland&rsquo;s <em>Polls Apart 5</em> report looking at the accessibility of the 2007 Scottish elections for disabled people; welcomes the findings that access for disabled people has generally improved in relation to 2005 results; notes with concern that, despite improved access, more disabled people than ever before found voting to be harder than it was in previous elections, and calls on local and central government to ensure that accessibility for disabled people retains a high priority in their election planning.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-219</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Strengthening Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament extends its continuing support to the shared campus and twinning initiatives between denominational and non-denominational schools set up under the previous administration with the intention of breaking down real and perceived barriers and of giving young people the opportunity to build friendships and better understand each others&rsquo; backgrounds; agrees with the comments of Cardinal Keith O&rsquo;Brien in encouraging all Catholic schools to renew their efforts to build effective partnerships with their school neighbours for the benefit of all young people and of Scottish society at large, and firmly believes that further work to actively promote such initiatives should be undertaken.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-218</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>GM-Free Labelling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern over the recent decision by EU Ministers, contrary to the will of the European Parliament, that organic foods can be labelled &quot;GM-free&quot; even if they contain up to 0.9% genetically modified content; believes that this action disregards the preferences of European consumers for transparent food labelling and genuine consumer choice to reject GM ingredients; recognises that in the United Kingdom &quot;organic&quot; has always meant zero tolerance of genetically modified food, and further expresses concern at how this decision may undermine consumer confidence in organic labelling and, as a result, may put the Scottish organic sector at risk. <strong><em>R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-217</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Forward&rsquo;s Sustainable Supplies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament praises Aberdeen City Council&rsquo;s decision to allow Aberdeen Forward&rsquo;s Creative Waste Exchange charity to supply sustainable office equipment, arts and decoration material to schools, community centres and other public organisations; notes the positive environmental and economic consequences of such a decision, including a reduction in landfill contribution, manufacturing and transportation costs, and encourages other local authorities to pursue similar initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-216</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Melrose Book Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Melrose is holding its annual book festival from 21 to 24 June 2007; recognises the importance of such cultural events for the Borders and for Scotland as a whole; congratulates the organisers and sponsors for their work in producing another exciting schedule of events, and wishes the visitors and participants a successful and interesting weekend.</p>
