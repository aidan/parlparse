<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5080</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Opening of Cults and Bucksburn Academies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the opening of the new Cults Academy and Bucksburn Academy in Aberdeen; congratulates Aberdeen City Council on delivering two fantastic brand-new purpose-built facilities in the most recent phase of the &pound;120 million 3Rs project to rebuild or renovate eight primary and two secondary schools; considers that this is an indicator of Aberdeen City Council&rsquo;s ambition to deliver a school estate that is fit for the 21st century, and wishes pupils and teachers at Cults and Bucksburn academies the best possible start to life in their new schools.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5079</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Learning for Life</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow Caledonian University for winning the UK Award for Lifelong Learning and Widening Participation Initiative for the work of their Caledonian Club, which works with local children and families to introduce them to higher education, raising aspiration and building life skills; notes that it was the only Scottish university to win a prestigious Times Higher Education Award, and commends students and staff at Glasgow Caledonian University, and within the Caledonian Club, for their passionate commitment to lifelong learning and community development throughout Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5078</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Draconian Action against Filesharing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the poll findings published by YouGov that show that 70% of the UK public opposes plans to force internet service providers to disconnect customers suspected of filesharing; deeply regrets the enthusiasm being shown for these plans by the Secretary of State for Business, Lord Mandelson; considers that the proposal would lead to an increase in routine encryption, hijacking of internet protocol addresses and wi-fi networks, the unjustified disconnection of many individuals and a wider impact on other members of disconnected households; agrees with the UK All Party Parliamentary Communications Group that &quot;much of the problem with illegal sharing of copyrighted material has been caused by the rightsholders, and the music industry in particular, being far too slow in getting their act together and making popular legal alternatives available&quot;; recognises the growing importance, especially in rural areas, of reliable internet connections for access to public services, financial inclusion, education, democratic debate and other purposes, and urges the UK Government to abandon the current proposal and develop alternative approaches that properly balance creative artists&rsquo; right to fair recompense with the wider interests of the public.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5077</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Labour Silences Those Who Speak out against Organised Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the Labour-controlled Glasgow City Council appears to be gagging opposition councillors to prevent them from speaking out within the council against organised crime by refusing to allow a motion to be put forward in the names of Councillor McAllister and Councillor Greene; considers that the motion in question was to have been debated on Thursday 29 October 2009 at a full meeting of Glasgow City Council and would have allowed debate in relation to safety concerns at the Applerow Motors MOT testing centre in Lambhill in Glasgow, which was the scene of a gangland-style shooting in 2006; further considers that the motion would have exposed the lack of action by the Secretary of State for Transport, Lord Adonis, on this matter and the inability of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to deal with such matters; is disappointed that Glasgow&rsquo;s Lord Provost, Bob Winters, has called the motion not competent or relevant, and believes that this is an example of the Labour party attempting to talk tough on crime but in reality attempting to silence those who are trying to take a stand and effect real action against organised criminals.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5076</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Interfaith Organisation, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, Presents World Statesman Award to Gordon Brown</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that there are times in any government&rsquo;s term of office when elected members of the party of government would do well to engage in a period of self-denying ordinance; further considers that the current Scottish administration might consider urging its backbenchers to refrain from engaging in the expression of what could be construed as anti-American sentiment so soon after the offence caused to both American and Scottish people by the release of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi; notes that the organisation on whose behalf Henry Kissinger presented the World Statesman of the Year Award to Gordon Brown, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, is an interfaith organisation that campaigns for religious freedom and human rights, and does not consider that the criticism of Henry Kissinger expressed by Jamie Hepburn MSP in his amendment, S3M-4990.1, reflects in any way on the foundation and its work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5075</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Loanhead Town Hall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision of Midlothian Council to demolish Loanhead town hall; believes that this decision was taken in the face of strong local opposition and with no public consultation; commends the efforts of the community in Loanhead in trying to save its town hall, and encourages Midlothian Council to reconsider its decision in order to allow the community time to come forward with plans to take over the running of the town hall.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5074</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Pupils of Raigmore Primary, Inverness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils of Raigmore Primary School in Inverness, Scotland&rsquo;s winner at the annual Make IT Happy technology awards, which took place at the Houses of Parliament on 19 October 2009; notes that the pupils&rsquo; entry showed how they used technology to keep in touch with their fathers fighting in Afghanistan with the Black Watch 3 Scots; further notes that more than 230 primary schools across the United Kingdom registered for the 2009 competition, which challenged 9 to 11-year-olds to demonstrate how technology can be used creatively to make people in their communities happy, and hopes that the &pound;1,200 prize money will assist the Raigmore pupils to improve creative technologies in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5073</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Real Ale Pub of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Kilcreggan Hotel on being crowned Real Ale Pub of the Year for the second consecutive year; notes that the popular village hostelry topped a poll of members of the Glasgow and West of Scotland branch of the Campaign for Real Ale; understands that the pub was selected on the basis of serving consistently good ale and providing an excellent atmosphere for its customers, and would like to commend the Kilcreggan Hotel on sourcing high-quality beer from across Great Britain, giving the customer the best possible choice in value and quality.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5072</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Thompsons Solicitors</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Thompsons Solicitors on its recognition as Scotland&rsquo;s top legal firm in 2009; notes that the law firm earned this prestigious accolade last month in the Law Awards of Scotland 2009, organised by <em>The Firm</em> magazine; understands that the personal injury specialists have represented hundreds of families who have lost family members to asbestos and related illnesses, and appreciates the hard work that Thompsons is currently undertaking with the C.diff Justice Group, representing many of the families of the people who were affected by the Clostridium difficile outbreak at the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5071.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5071) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;; further recognises the need to support existing and new businesses to create jobs; regrets the historic underperformance of the Scottish economy in new business creation; welcomes the positive and timely impact of the significant business rate reductions for small and medium-sized businesses and the Town Centre Regeneration Fund, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with all other levels of government and with the business community to do more to help raise the level of new business start-ups in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5071.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5071) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;; believes that it is in the best interests of the Scottish economy to encourage a vibrant and competitive banking sector by separating the investment and retail functions of the biggest banks and giving customers and businesses the choice of smaller and more secure banks, for example by bringing the Bank of Scotland home to Scotland as a low-risk high street bank that serves the needs of local people and businesses.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5071.3</strong> <strong>Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5071) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the concern of Scotland&rsquo;s business organisations that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget fails to prioritise sustainable economic growth, as the Scottish Government has made substantial cuts to the enterprise, tourism, regeneration and housing budgets and has decided to cancel the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, a decision that was taken without prior consultation, despite the fact that it is an infrastructure project of national importance; believes that all of these decisions compound the failure of the Scottish Futures Trust to deliver capital investment, to the detriment of jobs and infrastructure, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward new proposals to create jobs, increase infrastructure investment and grow the Scottish economy.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5071.4</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5071) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;; believes that the Scottish Government should be supporting only those projects that can promote true sustainability in the long term such as public transport, energy efficiency, low-carbon technologies, including renewable energy and its required infrastructure such as vital grid upgrades, and accepts that the benefits of a low-carbon economy must be achieved in a manner that ensures fairer distribution of wealth and opportunity and promotes wellbeing in the broadest sense, instead of continuing to promote an economy that is still based on ever more unsustainable levels of ecological and financial debt.&quot;</p>
