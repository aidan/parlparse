         <p align="center"><strong> Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
         <p> 9.30 am Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
         <p> The Clerk has been advised of the topic of the following Scottish National Party Business </p>
         <p> <em>followed by</em> </p>
         <p>Scottish National Party Debate: The Economy&mdash;</p>
         <p> <strong>S2M-2361 Nicola Sturgeon: The Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls for Scotland to acquire the economic powers currently enjoyed by other similar-sized European nations; recognises that there are many lessons to be learnt from other such nations, many of whom have fewer natural resources than Scotland but are more globally competitive and have far higher standards of living; notes, in particular, that, unlike Scotland, Norway has benefited enormously from its oil and gas resources with living standards that are amongst the highest in the world and an oil fund for future generations that is now worth well over &pound;80 billion; notes that our oil revenues are projected to reach at least &pound;6 billion in 2005 and to continue well into the future, and calls for Scotland to have control over offshore resources as one aspect of an economic strategy designed to make us a much more competitive nation with world-class public services, constantly-improving skills and infrastructure and our own Scottish oil fund to provide a lasting legacy. </p>
         <p> The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
         <p> <strong>S2M-2361.3 Mr Jim Wallace: The Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2361) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &ldquo;calls&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;welcomes the progress that the Scottish Executive is making towards delivering the priorities of <em>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</em> by working to improve productivity throughout the economy; welcomes, in particular, the record investment in Scotland&rsquo;s transport and electronic infrastructure, world-class universities and colleges and in the wholesale modernisation of Scotland&rsquo;s schools; notes that the Financial Times&rsquo; fDI European Region of the Future accolade was awarded to Scotland because of this public investment, favourable business environment, level of skills and quality of life; believes that raising Scotland&rsquo;s rate of economic growth sustainably over the long term requires a focus on improving skills, regenerating communities and supporting companies and others to internationalise and invest in research, and recognises that a drawn out and messy separation from the rest of the UK, and prospectively the EU, would undermine these strengths, play into the hands of Scotland&rsquo;s competitors and provide Scotland with a lasting legacy of cost, bureaucracy and barriers to trade.&rdquo;</p>
         <p> <strong>S2M-2361.1 Murdo Fraser: The Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2361) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from first &ldquo;calls&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;agrees that fluctuating prices and finite supplies make oil revenue an unreliable source of income; notes that, even if all revenue from North Sea oil had been allocated to Scotland in 2002-03, net borrowing would still have been &pound;4.4 billion; further notes that Scotland&rsquo;s businesses, who are the core drivers of wealth and economic growth, are demanding concrete action, not constitutional change, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to take immediate steps to create a more business-friendly environment by reducing business rates and water charges and cutting red tape, thereby encouraging business development and boosting Scotland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness.&rdquo; </p>
         <p> <strong>S2M-2361.2 Shiona Baird: The Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2361) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &ldquo;recognises&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;rejects the notion that Scotland&rsquo;s independent economic future depends on oil; recognises that an economy founded on fossil-fuel use contributes to climate change and other environmental damage, which in turn threatens Scotland&rsquo;s economic future; recognises that oil is a finite resource which future generations will not be able to depend on for economic security; further recognises that oil is valuable as a chemical resource which should be increasingly conserved for non-fuel uses; believes that building Scotland&rsquo;s economy on a foundation of renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency and sustainable transport is the way to achieve real sustainability, and calls on the Scottish Executive to give priority to exploring the concept of a &ldquo;just transition&rdquo; policy, as advocated by Scottish trade unions, which sets out a path to transform polluting industries into sustainable enterprises.&rdquo; </p>
         <p> <strong>S2M-2361.4 Frances Curran: The Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2361) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &ldquo;recognises&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;believes that these powers should include the power to take into public ownership our oil and gas reserves; notes that Norway has benefited enormously from its oil and gas resources with living standards that are amongst the highest in the world; notes that the main reason for this benefit is the interventionist policy of Norway, where the government-owned oil investment fund has now topped &pound;165 billion and its state oil company, Stateoil, has a 51% stake in the two other Norwegian oil companies which brings in 50% of all oil revenues, and believes that a future Scottish government should take into complete public ownership all North Sea oil and gas reserves through a state-owned oil company so that oil revenues can be invested for the benefit of the people of Scotland and not oil company shareholders.&rdquo; </p>
