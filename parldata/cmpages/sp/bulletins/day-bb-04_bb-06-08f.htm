          <p><strong>*S2M-1424#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Full 
            Freedom for Mordechai Vanunu</strong>-That the Parliament notes Mordechai 
            Vanunu's interview with the BBC broadcast on BBC2 on Sunday 30 May 
            2004 in which he revealed that it was his intention to save Israel 
            from a nuclear holocaust by blowing the whistle on the country's nuclear 
            programme; recognises that Mr Vanunu's decision to inform the world 
            of Israel's nuclear weapons programme was an act of bravery providing 
            much needed transparency to the international community; condemns 
            Israel's lengthy imprisonment of Mr Vanunu and the harsh restrictions 
            imposed on him after his release, including restrictions against his 
            right to travel and his right to speak to foreign nationals; supports 
            Mr Vanunu's petition to the Israeli High Court of Justice on Thursday 
            3 June 2004 appealing against the restrictions imposed after his release, 
            and believes that all weapons of mass destruction are an obstacle 
            to peace and that there should be moves to decommission them.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1423</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> 
            <strong>Death of Ronald Reagan</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with great sadness the death of former American President, Ronald 
            Reagan; recognises his enormous contribution to achieving a free world 
            and to the end of the Cold War and acknowledges his pivotal role in 
            driving back the frontiers of communism and in creating free and democratic 
            countries in Eastern Europe, many of which have joined the European 
            Union, as well as his inspiring leadership, and extends its deep sympathies 
            to the Reagan family and the American people.</P>
          <p>Supported by: David McLetchie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1422</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Withdrawal 
            of British Troops from Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            all British troops should be withdrawn from Iraq as soon as practically 
            possible; believes the decision to invade Iraq was based on lies, 
            deceit and distortion and that George W Bush and Tony Blair are guilty 
            of wilful deception in relation to weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi 
            links to Al-Qa'ida and Iraq posing an imminent &quot;45-minute&quot; 
            danger to British interests; believes that the invasion of Iraq was 
            illegal under international law and the continued presence of coalition 
            troops represents an illegal occupation of a sovereign country; believes 
            that the United Nations was wrong to support the bombing of Afghanistan 
            and that its regrettable inability to prevent the invasion of Iraq 
            exposes its inherent weakness in relation to US domination of our 
            world by legal or illegal means; supports world aid agency efforts 
            to help rebuild Iraq's infrastructure free from a US-imposed constitution 
            of privatisation and to divert resources to the Red Cross, Red Crescent 
            and M&eacute;dicins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, and reiterates its belief 
            that peace across the Middle East will only be possible when Israel 
            withdraws from its illegal occupation of Palestinian territories and 
            a viable Palestinian state is allowed to exist.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1421</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Bank 
            of Scotland's Children's International Theatre Festival</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the sterling work of those involved with 
            the Children's International Theatre Festival; notes that more than 
            10,000 children will attend the 78 performances in Edinburgh, Glasgow, 
            Inverness and Shetland, and congratulates the Bank of Scotland for 
            its support of an event that is aimed at encouraging new generations 
            to experience live performance.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1420</strong> <strong>Gardening Scotland 2004 - 4 to 
            6 June</strong> (lodged on 4 June 2004) Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1418</strong> <strong>Tolled Bridges</strong> (lodged

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1418.1</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> 
            <strong>Tolled Bridges</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1418) 
            in the name of Trish Godman, leave out from &quot;and seeks&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;; welcomes the announcement; recognises that 
            the Skye Bridge is unique among toll bridges in Scotland, both because 
            of the high level of tolls and because drivers have no other toll-free 
            alternative road, and urges the Scottish Executive to ignore attempts 
            to delay the lifting of the Skye Bridge tolls by central belt interests 
            raising the issue of other Scottish toll bridges.&quot;</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1414</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Seducing 
            our Children to Smoke</strong>-That the Parliament abhors any attempt 
            by tobacco manufacturers to try to seduce people, particularly youngsters, 
            into continuing, or starting, to smoke cigarettes *by attempting to 
            add chocolate, vanilla and alcohol flavouring to cigarettes*; recognises 
            that in Scotland approximately *19,000* people die each year through 
            tobacco-related illnesses and registers its contempt for British American 
            Tobacco's latest attempt to replace these deceased smokers by new 
            and younger ones; agrees that any attempt to make smoking more attractive 
            should be repelled, and urges members to support any legislation that 
            encourages the people of Scotland to give up smoking and helps persuade 
            non-smokers not to start.</P>
