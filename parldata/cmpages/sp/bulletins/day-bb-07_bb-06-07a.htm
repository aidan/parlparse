<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Labour Party Debate: Sustainable Public Transport Systems&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-127</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Sustainable Public Transport Systems</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that Scottish Executive ministers should respect decisions of this Parliament and, in keeping with that key principle, believes that ministers should not delay, substantially alter or cancel strategic transport projects, such as the Edinburgh Tram and Edinburgh Airport Rail Link schemes that have already been subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval; further believes that any proposed departure from those agreed parliamentary consents should also be subject to parliamentary approval; notes the urgency given that considerable expenditure has already been committed on these schemes, and re-affirms that ministers bear the responsibility for the effective procurement and delivery of major infrastructure projects. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-127.3</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Sustainable Public Transport Systems</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-127) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from first &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the different policy positions of various political parties; notes that the Scottish Government has invited the Auditor General to consider the approach to financial and risk management taken in the preparation of the Edinburgh Tram and Edinburgh Airport Rail Link proposals, and welcomes the fact that ministers will report to the Parliament on this matter before the summer recess.&quot;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-127.3.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Sustainable Public Transport Systems</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-127.3) in the name of Stewart Stevenson, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward a motion for parliamentary debate within its own time on these issues.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> <strong>S3M-127.2</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Sustainable Public Transport Systems</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-127) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;and notes with concern the decision to involve Audit Scotland in reviewing the Edinburgh Trams and Edinburgh Airport Rail Link projects, particularly given the short timescale in which Audit Scotland is to undertake the review, the lack of detail provided to the Parliament on the terms of reference for the review and the possible implications for the independence of Audit Scotland.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Labour Party Debate: Skills and Vocational Education&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-126</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Skills and Vocational Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the concerns in the business community about the shortage of school leavers proficient in science and technical subjects; believes that there is a role for academic institutions concentrating on vocational skills and science, and calls for the introduction of skills academies and science centres of excellence as a contribution to improving both the skills needed for 21st Century Scotland and the life opportunities for our young people. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-126.3</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Skills and Vocational Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-126) in the name of Hugh Henry, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the concerns raised by the business community about the shortage of school leavers proficient in science and technical subjects; believes that there is a need for more vocational skills experience for 14 to 18-year-olds, including improvements in school/college links and increased focus on the teaching of science in schools, and notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision to develop a Scottish skills strategy to help deliver the skills needed for 21st century Scotland.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-126.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Skills and Vocational Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-126) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end &quot;but also appreciates the excellent facilities and expertise in further education colleges and believes that more use must be made of these for educating school-age pupils so that, taken together with the introduction of specialist vocational schools, this ensures that every young person can readily access vocational education courses from the age of 14, and further believes that each local authority should work with head teachers and local further education institutions to produce a strategy for teaching science and technology.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-126.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Skills and Vocational Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-126) in the name of Hugh Henry, leave out from &quot;about the shortage&quot; to end and insert &quot;that opportunities should exist for school pupils to gain vocational and educational skills from the age of 14 through both school and college; believes that there should be closer links between schools, colleges and local businesses building on the highly successful school and college partnerships and the Skills for Work and Determined to Succeed initiatives; reaffirms its support for comprehensive secondary education; rejects the establishment of skills academies, and rather believes that Scotland&rsquo;s colleges should receive an annual 3% real terms increase in funding to help support partnerships with schools, that there should be a new target of 50,000 Modern Apprenticeships by 2011 to widen training opportunities for young people, that secondary schools and colleges should have business incubators to develop entrepreneurial skills and to ensure that Scotland remains competitive in delivering high-level skills and research and that the Scottish Executive should meet the funding bid from Universities Scotland for an additional &pound;168 million funding over the next spending review period.&quot; </p>

  <p><strong>S3M-29</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Alimta for Mesothelioma Sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that mesothelioma is a particularly aggressive cancer of the lungs, almost exclusively caused by exposure to asbestos; also recognises that West Dunbartonshire has the highest incidence of this work-related disease in Scotland and the second highest in the United Kingdom; further recognises that Alimta is the only drug licensed to treat mesothelioma, where it has been found to deliver significant improvements in the quality of life of sufferers, and considers that Scottish Executive ministers should ensure that Alimta continues to be made available to all existing and new mesothelioma sufferers who, in the professional opinion of consultant oncologists, would benefit from it.</p>
