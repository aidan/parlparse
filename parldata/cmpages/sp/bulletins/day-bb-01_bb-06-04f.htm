            of its architectural heritage and of the value of its built environment; 
            regrets that significant and valuable buildings are still being demolished 
            but congratulates the Trust and enthusiastic individuals and organisations

            of the debt crisis which is devastating many of the world’s poorest 
            countries; acknowledges and welcomes the leading role played by Her

            economic conditions unless further action is taken by the international 
            community, and urges the leaders of the ‘Group of 8’ countries to 
            consider a new deal on debt at their summit in July which comprises 
            greater and speedier debt relief, includes more countries and is better

            the end of 2002; further notes the Executive’s commitment to expand

            be given to the development of a suitable station convenient for the

            – Rise and Shine&quot; campaign aimed at the regeneration of Kilmarnock

            involvement in the promotion of their own community which, along with 
            the £8 million already invested in this area, will produce major economic

            the huge contribution which carers make to society as the mainstay

            the Scottish Carers’ Legislation Working Group and the ongoing consultation

            over 60 businesses, trade unions, football clubs, medical and children’s 
            charities which supports the campaign to restrict smoking in public 
            places; notes that over half of the businesses in the Scottish leisure 
            industry have no smoking policies in place; further notes that passive 
            smoking is a risk factor in childhood asthma, bronchitis and cot death 
            and that an estimated 30 Scots die each year from lung cancer attributable 
            to passive smoking; acknowledges that the Scientific Committee on 
            Tobacco and Health Report stated that passive smoking causes lung 
            cancer, increases the risk of heart disease and makes asthma worse; 
            supports premises adopting the Voluntary Charter on smoking in public 
            places; further supports the introduction of the Approved Code of 
            Practice on smoking in the workplace with close monitoring of its 
            effectiveness; believes that, if these measures fail, appropriate 
            legislation should be introduced to protect those who do not wish 
            to be harmed by passive smoking in enclosed or semi-enclosed areas 
            open to members of the public and workplaces, and urges the Scottish

            the need for greater awareness of this disease amongst the general 
            public and the medical profession, and encourages greater co-operation

            Colour of Scotland's National Flag</strong>—That the Parliament notes ongoing 
            concern that the blue background of the St Andrew’s Cross or Saltire, 
            probably the oldest national flag in the world, varies in shade ranging 
            from light blue through dark blue to navy; disputes the argument that 
            the Executive cannot take a view on this matter on the grounds that 
            heraldic responsibility lies with Westminster, since the Lord Lyon 
            King of Arms has been in charge for many centuries of all aspects 
            of heraldry in Scotland; believes that the relevance of heraldry to 
            national flags is questionable not least because there is no heraldic 
            definition of colours, which is why many countries define the colours 
            of their national flag in law; and believes that the Executive should 
            acknowledge that it is entirely appropriate for any modern Parliament 
            to take a view on the proper colour of its national flag and that 
            a legal definition of the Saltire’s colours would be welcomed.</font></p>

            the charity which owns Dundee’s leading tourist attractions RRS Discovery 
            and Verdant Works, has been forced into a series of cost cutting exercises 
            and staff redundancies because of continuing decline in the Scottish 
            tourism market and a critical shortfall in revenue support; further 
            notes that the Trust has warned that unless significant additional 
            revenue support can be found it will consider the closure of Verdant 
            Works, the last working jute mill in Scotland and the 1999 European 
            Industrial Museum of the Year, and therefore calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to provide emergency funding to secure the jobs of the 43 
            staff employed by Dundee Heritage Trust across three sites in the 
            city and, in the longer term, to extend central revenue support in 
            partnership with local authority support to avoid a huge loss, not 
            just to the city of Dundee, but to the cultural heritage of the nation.

            Murray: Flood Prevention</strong>—That the Parliament notes the responsibility 
            which local authorities have for flood prevention measures and also 
            the need for them to give consideration to possible flood risks when 
            considering planning applications; further notes that local authorities 
            have access to estimated 100 year flood maps provided by the Scottish 
            Environment Protection Agency for this purpose but is concerned that 
            the scale of these maps, produced by the Institute of Hydrology, is 
            1:50,000 and that they only provide information in 50 square metre 
            blocks; urges the Scottish Executive to give consideration to the 
            effectiveness of these maps; believes that the Executive should work 
            with all local authorities to identify areas of flood risk which are 
            susceptible to flooding and to develop a national scheme to restrict 
            or prohibit development on &quot;at risk&quot; areas, and further 
            urges the Executive to produce a long term strategy for areas of development 
            currently prone to flooding.</font></p>
