<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3856</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Trident Nuclear Weapons</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that there should be the fullest possible public debate on any decision to replace the Trident nuclear weapons system; notes that a successor to Trident could cost as much as &pound;25 billion, therefore significantly affecting other public spending options; calls on the Scottish Executive to urge the UK Government to produce a Green Paper on Trident replacement that considers all possible options, including non-replacement, and further calls on the Executive to urge the UK Government not to conclude any agreements, or to engage in preparations to build a new generation of nuclear weapons, until after this debate.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3855</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Leven Cottage Care Home</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the two residents from the Leven Cottage care home in the Vale of Leven who have refused to leave their home in the face of a West Dunbartonshire Council decision to close the 11-bed care home; sends its support to local people who have spent the last 55 days in permanent occupation of the home to prevent closure, and believes that, with an increasing elderly population, we need to expand care home provision rather than continue to cut beds and close homes.</p>
<p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3854</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Budget (Scotland) No.3 Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Budget (Scotland) (No. 3) Bill.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3853</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Dundee University - Relocation of Training</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the current proposal from Dundee University to relocate all nurse and midwifery teaching, currently provided in Kirkcaldy, to Dundee; believes that this proposal would be detrimental to the future recruitment of nurses and midwives, particularly in relation to mature students living in Fife, and would have a major impact on NHS Fife; believes that NHS Fife is under an obligation to the Scottish Executive to provide premises in Fife from which the university&rsquo;s teaching role can be fulfilled; further believes that this local provision must continue, and therefore requests that this proposal be immediately withdrawn.</p>
<p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Christine May<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-3852</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Protecting Jobs and Services in the Borders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the Westminster Government&rsquo;s policy decision to migrate the benefit process of the Work and Pensions Office in Galashiels to the central belt; acknowledges that this action will cause job losses affecting workers and their families, as well as detrimentally affect services for the most vulnerable members of our society, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on its colleagues in Westminster to reverse this decision and protect jobs and services in the Scottish Borders.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3851</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Launch of Human Rights Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Human Rights Scotland for its work with voluntary organisations, local authorities, community groups and the general public to raise awareness of human rights; recognises that education is the key to understanding about rights and responsibilities; congratulates Human Rights Scotland on its launch under that name after 27 years of existence, first as part of the Scottish Human Rights Centre and later as the independent Scottish Human Rights Trust, and is confident that the organisation will continue to make an important contribution to the human rights field in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3850</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Dalkeith Defenders!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Dalkeith Defenders on their efforts to save Dalkeith country park from development; applauds the huge support shown to the defenders by the local community, despite reports to the contrary; recognises the traffic problems in and around the Dalkeith area but understands that these are due to the lack of investment in public transport and environmentally sustainable planning legislation by successive governments; further accepts that the proposed development through the country park will do nothing to relieve the situation but will damage the environment and the local community and will ultimately increase traffic levels on the road, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to halt the development immediately and to undertake a multimodal transport study and an environmental impact study to address the traffic problem in a socially and environmentally just manner.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3849</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Rural Post Offices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement in the House of Lords on 12 January 2006 that the UK Government will no longer fund Post Office card accounts; recognises that these accounts are essential to keeping rural post offices open; notes that these rural post offices are an essential and important part of life in many small communities in Angus, Perthshire and other parts of rural Scotland; recognises that many senior citizens throughout Scotland rely on these accounts to receive their pensions, and encourages the Scottish Executive to lobby the UK Government to ensure that rural post offices in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom remain open to serve the needs of their local communities.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3848#</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Cumbernauld Town Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, in the Channel 4  programme, &quot;Demolition&quot;, broadcast in December 2005, the public nominated and voted for Cumbernauld Town Shopping Centre as the most hated building in Britain; acknowledges that Cumbernauld is in a great location; commends the residents of Cumbernauld for maintaining a sense of pride in their town despite the problems, which have existed for many years, associated with design and the lack of an identifiable town centre; congratulates Channel 4 for having produced this excellent piece of broadcast journalism which, firstly, ensured that these problems have been the subject of a national awareness-raising exercise and, secondly, which provided practical solutions to these problems; recognises that quality of life is the core issue; expresses concern that North Lanarkshire Council intends to proceed with design plans for the town shopping centre which will, in the view of those who took part in the programme, merely compound the problems which already exist; believes that the Scottish Executive should encourage North Lanarkshire Council to take on board the suggestions made in the programme to regenerate Cumbernauld by creating an identifiable town centre starting at St Mungo&rsquo;s Church and continuing to tree-lined boulevards with shop fronts facing widened pavements where bistro and alfresco activities could be provided, and considers that North Lanarkshire Council should initiate a consultation with the residents of Cumbernauld on these proposals.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3848.1#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Cumbernauld Town Centre</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3848) in the name of Margaret Mitchell, leave out from &quot;congratulates&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that many of Cumbernauld&rsquo;s problems result from the reorganisation of Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities by the Tory party, including the dissolution of Cumbernauld District Council; believes that a lack of government funding for the past development corporation and the insistence by the Tory government that the town centre be sold off to commercial interests are contributory factors to the current condition of the centre because they restrict the ability of North Lanarkshire Council to tackle the problems, and considers that the council should initiate a consultation with the residents of Cumbernauld and that the owners of the town centre should engage in meaningful discussions on the future of the centre as a matter of urgency.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3847</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Scottish Energy Advice Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Energy Saving Trust for organising Scottish Energy Advice Week from 6 to 10 February 2006; recognises the work of the network of regional Energy Efficiency Advice Centres which offer free, expert advice on saving energy; urges individuals to pledge to save 20% of all the energy they use every day as the best means of hitting the target of a 20% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions below 1990 levels by 2010, and urges all MSPs to show leadership by supporting the Scottish Energy Advice Week campaign which promotes individual responsibility and actions.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3846</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Legislate for Better Health</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees with Dr Peter Terry, chairman of the British Medical Association in Scotland, that a long-term public health strategy can be effective only if there is a co-ordinated approach across all ministerial portfolios; notes that decisions taken in other policy areas have a significant bearing on public health; agrees on the need to develop synergistic policies and cross-departmental co-operation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce a system of routine health impact assessments to be applied to all policies and legislation.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>S2M-3839#</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Community and Village Halls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the increased costs of water charges paid by new village and community halls and that these will also be imposed on older halls after 2010; recognises that these halls play a vital role as the hub of the community by providing a venue for educational classes, Scottish dancing, recreation, Scottish Women&rsquo;s Rural Institute meetings, keep-fit classes, youth clubs, scouts, brownies and other activities; believes that these charges to charitable organisations are an undue burden on local rural communities in Angus; notes that the Scottish Executive has partly funded numerous new halls and refurbishments for many more which has caused an increase in the rateable value burden, and believes that the Executive should extend the exemption scheme to all community and village halls with charitable status and introduce legislation to reinstate the exemption for community and village halls which have charitable status.</p>
