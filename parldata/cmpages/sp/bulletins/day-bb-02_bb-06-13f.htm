          <p><strong>*S1M-3207</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Peebles Sheriff 
            Court</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the threat 
            of the permanent closure of Peebles Sheriff Court; further notes that 
            the Minister for Justice is currently considering a report into the 
            expenditure required to make the courthouse fully operational and 
            intends to make his conclusion public soon; further notes that the 
            retention of the sheriff court at Peebles is supported by, <em>inter 
            alia,</em> the Sheriff Principal of Lothian and Borders, the two sheriffs 
            who sit there, the Society of Solicitors in the Shires of Selkirk 
            and Peebles and the Faculty of Solicitors in Roxburghshire, and urges 
            the Scottish Executive, in implementing its commitment to access to 
            justice for all, to keep a sheriff court at Peebles, either refurbished 
            or new build.</p>

            Committee: Local Government Committee, Inquiry into Local Government 
            Finance</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 6th Report 2002 
            of the Local Government Committee, <em>Inquiry into Local Government 
            Finance</em> (SP Paper 551) and calls upon the Scottish Executive to

          <p><strong>*S1M-3205#</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Neurosurgery 
            for Mental Disorder</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the imminent 
            introduction of regulations regarding the use of neurosurgery for 
            mental disorder (NMD); acknowledges the resolution of the General 
            Assembly of the United Nations A/RES/46/119 17 December 1991, Principle 
            11 (14) which states &quot;Psychosurgery and other intrusive and irreversible 
            treatments for mental disorder shall never be carried out on a patient 
            who is an involuntary patient in a mental health facility and, to 
            the extent that domestic law permits them to be carried out, they 
            may be carried out on any other patient only where the patient has 
            given informed consent and an independent external body has satisfied 
            itself that there is genuine informed consent and that the treatment 
            best serves the health needs of the patient&quot;, and considers that 
            the Parliament and the Health and Community Care Committee should 
            assess the implications of such regulations for basic human rights 
            whilst taking into consideration the report from the NMD service in 
            Dundee which does not support the use of such procedures on patients 
            who are incapable of giving informed consent.</p>

            involving both local authorities and schools, the promotion of flexibility 
            in the curriculum and devolved school management arrangements, the 
            contribution made by New Community Schools to supporting pupils&#146; 
            learning and involving parents and carers, recognises the valuable 
            contribution made by denominational schools and believes that our 
            priorities should continue to be the provision of a high quality education 
            appropriate to the needs of every young person in Scotland and closing 
            the opportunity gap.&quot; </p>

            rights will be incorporated into the Common Fisheries Policy in perpetuity; 
            believes that the proposed regional committees must have genuine decision-making 
            powers to make a difference; notes that the EU continues to pursue 
            damaging fisheries policies including the proposed inappropriate regulation 
            of the deep-sea fishery, and calls on the Minister for Environment 
            and Rural Development to demand that he leads the UK&#146;s delegation 
            during the forthcoming negotiations in order to secure Scotland&#146;s

            acknowledges the need for a more sustainable balance between the catching 
            capability of the fleet and available fish stocks; recognises that 
            a process of tough negotiations with other member states now lies 
            ahead, which was highlighted in yesterday&#146;s u-turn by the EU 
            Fisheries Commissioner, Franz Fischler, over the issue of deep water 
            species which has left our fleet with only 2% of that total allowable 
            catch in their local waters, and further recognises that action of 
            this kind will only serve to undermine confidence in the overall Common 
            Fisheries Policy reform programme.&quot; </p>

            to end and insert &quot;recognises continuing public concern about 
            the levels of youth crime; regrets the failure of the Scottish Executive 
            to take effective action to tackle such crime; believes that tackling 
            youth crime effectively and appropriately is a key element in reducing 
            overall levels of crime and fear of crime, and calls upon the Executive 
            to introduce practical measures to prevent youth crime and to ensure 
            that there are sufficient places so that those young offenders who,

            Scotland&#146;s Action Plan to reduce youth crime and the establishment

            of their behaviour; supports all parties involved in the youth justice
