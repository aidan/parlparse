<STRONG>Richard Lochhead: HM Chief Inspector of Prison Report on HM Prison Aberdeen</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the decision by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, Clive Fairweather, 
to publish an unprecedented and highly critical intermediate report on HM Prison 
Aberdeen that highlights serious staffing difficulties, violence and the lack 
of any meaningful regime; further notes that the report describes the prison's 
needs assessment, sentence management and pre-release arrangements as inadequate; 
condemns the Scottish Prison Service management for allowing such a situation 
to develop; expresses extreme concern that the report states that no drugs strategy 
is in place at the prison despite the huge drug problem in the north-east of Scotland 
and the fact that Aberdeen has some of the highest crime rates in Scotland all 
of which are drug- related, and considers that both the Scottish Executive and 
one of the Justice Committees should investigate conditions at Craiginches and 
the prison's role in reducing re-offending.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3388</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr 
Kenny MacAskill: 50th Anniversary of the Nordic Council</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament congratulates the Nordic Council on its 50th<SUP> </SUP>anniversary; 
notes the benefits that the council has brought to the peoples, regions and nations 
of the Nordic area in terms of social, political and economic co-operation; sees 
the organisation as a potential model for the peoples, regions and nations of 
the islands of Britain and Ireland, and believes that closer political ties and 
links with the Nordic Council and between the Scottish Executive and the Nordic 
Council of Ministers should be developed.</P><P>Supported by: Tavish Scott<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

Fitzpatrick: New Cancer BACUP Scotland Centre Opened in Glasgow</STRONG>&#151;That

Glasgow to provide information and support to anyone affected by cancer; recognises 
that cancer is one of Scotland's biggest public health problems; notes that CancerBACUP's 
specialist nurses answer more than 50,000 questions a year on all types of cancer 
and that the new centre will enable the charity to answer an extra 18,000 enquiries 
every year<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">, </FONT>and applauds the efforts of the Sunday 
Mail and people all over Scotland in raising funds for this initiative to support 
cancer patients and their families and friends.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3386 Mr Mike
