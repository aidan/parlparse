          <p><strong> Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#). </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

          <p align="center"><strong> New and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2664</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: M74 Costs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates members of the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Scottish National parties on their principled stance in voicing their concerns over the escalating costs of the Scottish Parliament building and, while noting their support for the construction of the M74 project, calls on those members to maintain those democratic principles by further voicing their concerns over the predicted escalating costs of the M74 project.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2663</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell: Penalisation of Cycling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by NHS Tayside to introduce cycle parking charges for staff members commuting from Fife and the wider Dundee area to Ninewells Hospital; notes that the cost of construction and maintenance of an individual car parking space is far in excess of the cost of a secure cycle parking space, and believes that the development of a vibrant cycle culture in Scotland that is capable of improving both public health and the environment requires giving incentives to cycle commuting, not penalising it. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2662</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles: Nurse Staffing Levels</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent Royal College of Nursing Scotland survey of its members which found that 70% believed that appropriate staffing levels, including nurse:patient ratios, would help them to improve patient care by guaranteeing that there is always the right number and mix of staff on duty; further notes the international evidence supporting the case for higher nurse staffing levels producing better patient outcomes, including lower infection rates, fewer patient falls, reduced hospital stays and lower patient mortality rates, and believes that both the Scottish public and NHS staff expect every potential means of improving healthcare provision to be explored and that this issue should therefore be subject to further widespread public and political debate. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2661</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: M74 Undemocratic Environmental Injustice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns utterly the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with the M74 project; acknowledges that the Public Inquiry Reporter recommended that the project should not proceed; notes with deep outrage that the Executive has chosen to ignore the reporter&rsquo;s recommendations; further notes that this comes after the Executive had ignored the wishes of the local communities who will be affected by this project; notes that the First Minister prejudiced the inquiry by announcing that the project would go ahead before the inquiry had been completed; recognises and condemns utterly the fact that this is another example of environmental injustice undemocratically foisted on the people of Scotland by the Executive, and calls on the Executive to uphold basic democratic principles and stop the M74 project immediately. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2660</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: STUC Support for M74</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the STUC&rsquo;s support for the M74 project and calls on the STUC to reconsider its position on the project and withdraw that support in light of the fact that there is no evidence that this project will create jobs and, indeed, that job creation will only come from investment in a properly integrated public transport system. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2659# Rosie Kane: M74 Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recommendation of the Public Inquiry Reporter that the M74 project should not proceed. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2658</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne: Gypsy Travellers&rsquo; Right to Homes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament utterly condemns discriminatory attacks on the gypsy traveller community by the Conservative Party leader, Michael Howard; acknowledges that it was the discriminatory policies of the 1994 Conservative Government, of which Michael Howard was part, which abolished the legislation that compelled councils to provide travellers&rsquo; sites; further acknowledges that the sites that do exist for gypsy travellers are of an insufficient standard and inadequate for their family and community needs, and calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce legislation to compel councils to create and maintain sites for gypsy travellers. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2657</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne: Poultry Meat Standards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the improving standards in animal welfare and environmental protection in the Scottish poultry industry; acknowledges and applauds the drive to raise these standards even further; condemns, however, the situation where Scottish poultry producers are penalised by having to bear the cost of increased standards while at the same time imports of poultry meat from countries with lower standards are allowed, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on EU trade ministers to demand that the same rigour of animal welfare standards and environmental measures is applied to imported meat. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2656</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne: Shewalton Landfill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the lack of transparency by North Ayrshire Council in its dealings over the new Shewalton landfill site development; further condemns the council&rsquo;s lack of commitment and investment in alternative methods of waste disposal, and calls on the council to introduce an alternative waste disposal method as a matter of urgency and for an overhaul of its methods of releasing information to members of the community. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2655</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance: M74 Decision</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Scottish Executive to proceed with the M74 northern extension, despite the damning criticism of the project made by the reporters of the public inquiry; agrees with their findings that the road will have very serious and undesirable results and that the economic and traffic benefits of the project arising from the transfer of future jobs from other parts of Scotland would be much more limited than stated by the Executive; believes that the motorway will only create a long-term increase in traffic, will not reduce congestion, will have a damaging impact on already disadvantaged communities and will worsen climate change pollution; further believes that the Executive has shown utter disregard for its own planning procedures, and supports the campaigners who have pledged themselves to direct action to prevent the construction of the road. </p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2654# Dennis Canavan: Archbishop Oscar Romero</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises 24 March 2005 as the 25 th anniversary of the assassination of Oscar Romero, Archbishop of San Salvador, when he was celebrating Mass in a hospital chapel; salutes the courage of Oscar Romero in speaking out against the killings, disappearances, torture and other human rights violations suffered by the people of El Salvador; applauds his endeavours to liberate his people from oppression and poverty, and hopes that the celebration of Archbishop Romero&rsquo;s life will be an inspiration to people all over the world to campaign for peace, justice and respect for human rights. </p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2653</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Breakthrough Breast Cancer Drug</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the development of the new breast cancer drug, Femara (letrozole), which is a major weapon in the fight against the disease by cutting the risk of breast cancer recurring by 42% and lowering the risk of cancer spreading to other parts of the body by 39%; notes that this throws a lifeline to post-menopausal women, the majority of breast cancer patients; further notes that the drug prevents breast cancer recurrence and is a breakthrough in the battle against the most common form of cancer among Scottish women, as the only prior options were surgery and a maximum of five years tamoxifen therapy with no other preventative measures available after these, and acknowledges that the drug lowers the number of women needing expensive treatment for recurring cancers while providing new hope for a positive and healthy future. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2652</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: Defend the Gypsy, Traveller and Roma Community against Attack</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views the comments of the Conservative Party leader, Michael Howard, in respect of the traveller community as utterly abhorrent; notes that, as Home Secretary responsible for the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Mr Howard made trespass a criminal offence, strengthened police powers of eviction and removed the statutory duty to provide sites for Gypsies and travellers, resulting in traveller sites becoming overcrowded and forcing many young Gypsies and travellers into a cycle of trespass and eviction, and calls on all members and representatives of the Conservative and Unionist Party to disassociate themselves from remarks that will inevitably result in an increase in hostility to the traveller, Gypsy and Roma community. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2651</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Meeting Scotland&rsquo;s Future Energy Needs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes and supports the conclusions and recommendations of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee&rsquo;s report, &ldquo;Meeting Scotland&rsquo;s Future Energy Needs&rdquo;; agrees that it is &ldquo;vital that decisions are taken now to obviate the possibility of, quite literally, the lights going out in Scotland in the foreseeable future&rdquo;, and further agrees that it is unwise to assume that emerging technologies can meet a quarter of the renewable proportion of Scotland&rsquo;s energy needs and that, if the Executive is serious about tackling climate change and securing our energy supply, it must make a commitment to nuclear power in Scotland for the long term. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2650# Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Protected Geographical Indicator Status for Scotch Whisky</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that EU Protected Geographical Indicator (PGI) status for Scotch whisky would provide a further selling point for the end product; welcomes the fact that this would require the use of Scottish-only grain in the manufacture of Scotch whisky; believes that the industry should apply for PGI status to help ensure the long-term sustainability of Scottish cereal growing, and considers that any such application should be supported by the Scottish Executive. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2649 Colin Fox: Three Cheers for Chomsky</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh University and its Palestinian Solidarity Campaign Society for hosting two outstanding lectures by the highly-respected political scholar and dissident, Professor Noam Chomsky; notes that more than 2,000 people crowded in to hear his views on US imperialism and international affairs and were enthralled at the extent of his wisdom and advice on world affairs; regards his visit to Edinburgh as both a considerable success and a highlight of the year, and thanks Professor Chomsky himself for ably standing in for the late and much-missed Professor Edward Said who had originally been invited but who died recently. </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2648 # Richard Baker: Tackling Antisocial Behaviour in Grampian</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Grampian Police on its use of new antisocial behaviour laws; believes that antisocial behaviour is a blight on too many communities in the north east; notes that particular problems in the north east relating to under-age drinking and antisocial behaviour by drivers at Aberdeen&rsquo;s Beach Boulevard have been successfully targeted by Grampian Police through the new powers; welcomes the fact that Aberdeen has had amongst the highest numbers of antisocial behaviour orders granted in Scotland, and also welcomes innovative schemes to offer young people alternative activities, such as Grampian Police&rsquo;s &ldquo;Give the Broch a Break&rdquo; initiative. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2643 Patrick Harvie: London School of Economics Study: The Identity Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings in a recent comprehensive study by the London School of Economics (LSE), <em>The Identity Project: an assessment of the UK Identity Cards Bill</em>, that involved more than 100 academics and outside experts in the fields of law, technology, information systems, government policy, business, economics and security; is concerned that the authors of the study have concluded that the proposals for an identity card and database scheme are &ldquo;too complex, technically unsafe, overly prescriptive and lack a foundation of public trust and confidence&rdquo;; further notes that the report has warned that, rather than increasing UK security, the Bill may create greater security dangers than before as well as contravene the European Convention on Human Rights and exceed current cost projections; agrees with the main conclusion of the LSE study that the current identity card legislation must be abandoned, and calls on the Scottish Executive to comply with the terms of motion S2M-2463 by giving a full statement to Parliament on the intended use of the identity database by devolved institutions. </strong></p>

          <p> Supported by: Stewart Stevenson </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2639 # Fiona Hyslop: Generation Squalor</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the publication by Shelter of <em>Generation Squalor</em>, Shelter&rsquo;s national investigation into the housing crisis, and in particular the findings that temporary accommodation constantly disrupts children&rsquo;s education, that last year 26,584 children in Scotland lived in households that applied as homeless, which is one child for every classroom, and that homeless children living in temporary accommodation on average miss out on a quarter of their schooling; notes with concern that there are many issues facing families in short-term accommodation where, in the 21st century, they have no cooker and no bed and where babies suffer physiological damage from being kept in buggies too long because of housing conditions; further notes that, although the Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 seeks to give everyone the right to a home by 2012, it will not be enough on its own to solve the housing crisis, and believes that the increased provision of affordable rented accommodation is an essential part of the solution to these problems which shame this country. </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2638 # Shiona Baird: OFT Failure to Protect Farmers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the Supermarkets Code compliance audit by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT); further notes the continuing control by just four supermarket chains of over 75% of the UK grocery sector and recent allegations that one of these, Tesco, caused the delay in the publication of the OFT audit; regrets that the OFT audit does not recommend the appointment of an independent ombudsman to ensure the proper enforcement of <em>The supermarkets code of practice</em>, despite its previous report finding that a &ldquo;climate of apprehension&rdquo; was preventing complaints being made by farmers for fear of being de-listed and other reprisals; expresses its concern that the situation for farmers remains bleak, with many going out of business each year due to supermarkets&rsquo; exploitative practices; notes the invitation by the OFT for further evidence to be submitted by 31 May 2005, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its influence to ensure that <em>The supermarkets code of practice</em> is extended and properly enforced throughout the entire supply chain and that farmers are adequately supported and protected to make complaints.

          <p> <strong>S2M-2637 Christine Grahame: Grub Log</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments of Euan Robson, Deputy Minister for Education and Young People, on BBC Newsnight Scotland on 21 March 2005 regarding the lack of data on the impact of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s healthy eating initiative; notes the rise in children&rsquo;s obesity from 9% at P1 to 18% at P7, and therefore urges the Executive to produce and circulate an e-questionnaire to pupils in all our schools, along the lines of Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;grub log&rdquo;, as a snapshot into the actual eating habits of both primary and secondary pupils as a first step in closing the data gap. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2636 Bruce Crawford: 1,599 Rosyth Job Losses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply saddened by the announcement of 320 further job losses at Rosyth dockyard and is seriously concerned at the resultant effect that this will have on families of dockyard workers and their communities in Fife and across Scotland; calls on all political parties and trade unions to campaign to save the jobs and also calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to end unfair and substantial government subsidies to English yards, which compete for the same MoD contract work as Rosyth; expresses concern that Rosyth dockyard&rsquo;s operators, Babcock, will not have the critical mass of skilled employees available to deliver a successful future for the dockyard; congratulates the highly-skilled Rosyth workforce for making all the changes required of it to create a more flexible and cost-effective operation, and admires its dedication, particularly in the face of losing more than half the workforce since 1997, with a total of 1,599 people having lost their job since New Labour came to power. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2635 Christine Grahame: Council Tax Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of a Help the Aged survey regarding the plight of many of Scotland&rsquo;s pensioners which disclosed that some 70% of those responding were in council tax poverty, that the average pensioner paid 11% of net income on council tax and water rates, that accordingly the majority of pensioner households are forced to make budget cuts every year following increases in council tax and water rates and that these cuts are often made in heating, leisure, clothing and travel; notes that some 22% of those surveyed did not know that they were entitled to council tax benefit and that 40% of those entitled to claim benefit did not do so; further notes that it may be that the poorest pensioners are the very people who do not claim; notes the one-off payment of &pound;200 towards council tax and considers this to be little more than a pre-election bribe and further that it is not payable to those female pensioners under the age of 65 who are often the poorest; notes that the Scottish National Party is committed to a non-means-tested citizens&rsquo; pension to be increased in line with earnings and to a local income tax, both of which would give dignity and independence to Scotland&rsquo;s pensioners, one in five of whom live in poverty, and calls on the Scottish Executive, at the very least, to introduce a local income tax as soon as practicable and to end the abhorrent means-testing of our pensioners which is not only undignified but is failing. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2621 Alex Neil: Waste of Public Money on Olympic Bid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the absurd waste of taxpayers&rsquo; and lottery money of up to &pound;60,000 by the Scottish Executive and its agencies, in particular <strong>sport</strong>scotland, to promote London&rsquo;s bid for the 2012 Olympics at a time when many small, local sports clubs and other organisations throughout Scotland are struggling to make ends meet, some of whom have been refused financial support by <strong>sport</strong>scotland and other Executive agencies; notes the campaign being orchestrated by the Mayor of London to persuade the UK Government to significantly reduce the share of spending allocated to Scotland by the Treasury; notes that the contractual opportunities available to Scottish companies would not be materially affected by whether the Olympics are held in London or Paris; recognises that, in any case, nearly all the potential benefits from holding the Olympics in London would accrue to that city and very few, if any, to other parts of the United Kingdom, and calls on the Executive to refuse any further subsidies to the London Olympic bid as Londoners are already sufficiently wealthy to be able to fund their own bid.</p>
