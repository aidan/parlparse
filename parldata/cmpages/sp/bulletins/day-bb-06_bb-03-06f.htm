<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;    ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4060&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Commonwealth Day 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the valuable role of the Commonwealth in strengthening relationships between nations across the world; welcomes the continued contribution of Scotland and its people to those relationships; reaffirms its support for the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA); notes that this year the CPA Scotland Branch and the Scottish Executive have, as a key focus, continued to develop relationships with Malawi; notes Scotland&rsquo;s longstanding work, particularly in the area of health, throughout the Commonwealth, and commends the theme of Commonwealth Day this year, &quot;Health and Vitality &ndash; the Commonwealth Challenge&quot;, which highlights the relevance of health, as illustrated in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4059</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Stop the Traffik</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the &quot;Stop the Traffik&quot; campaign due to be launched in the European Parliament on 21 March 2006 seeking the end of human trafficking; calls for a renewed effort to end the trafficking of people, and calls on all of Scotland&rsquo;s people to support the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4058#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Abolition of Tolls on the Forth and Tay Road Bridges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement to begin planning for the much-needed replacement bridge at Queensferry; further welcomes the fact that the request by the Forth Estuary Transport Authority to increase tolls on the existing bridge has been rejected; believes that it is neither fair, equitable nor consistent to leave Fife as the only area in Scotland to be burdened with tolls; considers that this will have a detrimental effect on social justice and the Fife economy, and supports calls to the Scottish Executive to review its decision to maintain tolling on the Forth and Tay bridges.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christine May, Helen Eadie, Marilyn Livingstone</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4057&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>20th Anniversary of Nuclear Accident at Chernobyl</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 26 April 2006 is the 20th anniversary of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl and that the cross-party International Development Group is holding a meeting on that date to observe the anniversary of the accident, learn lessons from the past and look to the future; reflects upon the terrible social and environmental legacy that this horrific accident left, and continues to leave, in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and beyond; pays respect to the many people whose lives were lost following the explosion; acknowledges with sadness the implications for all those who continue to suffer ill-health caused by radiation poisoning today and the severe difficulties still faced by the communities worst affected; further notes that pollution from the accident affected countries as far away as Scotland, where it continues to leave an environmental legacy; strongly commends Scottish charities and civic organisations for their outstanding work in supporting individuals and affected communities, and recognises the need to take national and international action to avoid any possibility of future environmental catastrophes such as the Chernobyl nuclear accident ever being repeated.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4056</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Abbotsford House - Home of Sir Walter Scott</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the internationally recognised literary talent of Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), author of novels, among others, such as <em>Waverley, Guy Mannering, The Heart of Midlothian</em> and <em>Redgauntlet, </em>and poems, such as the renowned &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;, which in its day sold 25,000 copies in eight months; further recognises the historic significance of his home, Abbotsford House, built by him on the site of Cartleyhole farmhouse and completed in 1824, incorporating eclectic architectural features, such as a gateway from Linlithgow Palace, roof designs from Rosslyn Chapel, a mantelpiece from Melrose Abbey and oak panelling from the Auld Kirk in Dunfermline, and notes that he also landscaped the grounds; expresses concern that the house and its contents, which include such artefacts as Rob Roy&rsquo;s gun, a lock of Bonnie Prince Charlie&rsquo;s hair and Montrose&rsquo;s sword, may be forced to close down in the next few years through lack of funding support, and calls on the Scottish Executive, in light of the house&rsquo;s literary and historic significance and indeed as an asset to the Borders and Scottish tourist industry, to intervene now and work with concerned parties, including the National Trust, to ensure the preservation of both the house itself and the idiosyncratic collections which reflect the personality of this talented and romantic Scot.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4055</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Puerto Rico</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the people of Puerto Rico on forcing the United States of America to remove its ships and planes from Puerto Rican waters in the face of local opposition to a major military exercise which would have resulted in the bombing and shelling of part of their coastline; recognises the benefits of having the powers to take such a decision that come from being an independent country and strongly regrets the fact that, due to the lack of these powers, the waters round the coast of Scotland are now being used for this military exercise; agrees that military exercises should not be dumped on Scotland when other countries assert their right to refuse to have them on their territory, and believes that the US military should use its own territory for bombing and shelling practice.</p>
