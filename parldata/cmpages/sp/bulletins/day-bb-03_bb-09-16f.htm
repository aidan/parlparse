          <p><strong>*S2M-347</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Redundancy 
            Notices at the National Library of Scotland</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament condemns the redundancy notices to six senior heads of 
            department at the National Library of Scotland and regrets the fact 
            that the skills of the six most knowledgeable librarians in Scotland 
            are potentially to be lost to the nation.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-346</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Borders 
            Railway Funding</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the lodging 
            of the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill; notes that Stow is not to 
            be included as a stop, although the projected time for the journey 
            without that stop is now some 61 minutes from Galashiels to Edinburgh 
            when in 1954 the same journey took 49 minutes; is concerned that this 
            line requires to meet some, as yet unspecified, business case, a test 
            not put with regard to other announced rail, road or tram developments 
            and that accordingly no firm commitment has been given to this funding, 
            and asks the Scottish Executive to detail the criteria for this business 
            case now.</p>

            Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Michael

          <p> <strong>*S2M-345</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Swedish 
            Referendum on Euro Membership</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
            the convincing result of the Swedish referendum on euro membership; 
            congratulates the people of Sweden for having the courage to vote 
            &quot;No&quot; to the euro in such large numbers against the weight 
            of the entire political, business and media establishment; agrees 
            with the Swedish people that joining the euro would not be in the 
            economic interests of Sweden and would have meant a substantial loss 
            of national sovereignty, and looks forward to Her Majesty's Government 
            calling a euro referendum here at the earliest opportunity in order 
            that the people of Scotland can demonstrate that their opposition 
            to the euro is every bit as strong as that of the Swedes.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-344#</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Sweden</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the Swedish 
            nation for standing up to the pressure of politicians at home and 
            abroad whose aim, as stated by the Italian Ambassador to the United 
            Kingdom, is to give birth to a European super state and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should apply pressure on Her Majesty's 
            Government to hold referenda on both the European constitution and 
            the common European currency at an early date in order that uncertainties 
            within the Scottish economy are removed in line with the democratic 
            wishes of Scots and UK citizens as a whole.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-343#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Food Fortnight</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the 
            organisers of Scottish Food Fortnight, the first ever national celebration 
            of Scotland&#146;s best regional produce, to take place between 20 
            September and 5 October 2003 which will highlight the world-class
