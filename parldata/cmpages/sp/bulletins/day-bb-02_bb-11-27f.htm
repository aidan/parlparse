McGugan: Child Protection</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the opportunities 
afforded by <em>It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright -</em> <em>Report of 
the Child Protection Audit and Review</em>, to tackle the problems in child protection; 
further welcomes the recommendations of the review, which offers substantial evidence 
that there is good and effective work being carried out by a number of agencies; 
regrets that, rather than acknowledge the positives and invest in initiatives 
to promote consistent good practice across the country, the First Minister has 
chosen to deride and threaten workers in front-line child protection, while having 
done little in his administration to resource or support such workers; considers 
that these remarks will only undermine and damage the Scottish Executive's Care 
in Scotland campaign to attract people into the social care sector and serve to 
further demoralise those trying to protect children in increasingly difficult 
circumstances; notes that the report maintains that, although social workers play 
the most instrumental role in child protection, the level of vacancies in childcare 
teams remains a critical issue, a situation that is not being addressed with the 
urgency it merits and will not begin to be alleviated until at least 2008, when 
the first graduates will have completed the new training course, and believes 
that the Executive should take responsibility for this unacceptable situation, 
introduce measures to tackle recruitment and retention of front-line staff as 
a matter of priority and, as a further practical step, move as soon as possible 
towards placing child protection committees on a statutory footing, with adequate 
resources and an increased status and thereby contribute meaningfully and positively 
to child protection.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3650</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: 
Education</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament believes that the Scottish education 
system should move to the post-comprehensive era, where schools keep the comprehensive 
principle of equality of opportunity but are opened up to new and different ways 
of education built round the needs of the individual child and where there is 
a greater range of specialist schools for parents to choose from, offering excellent 
routes into university and skilled employment.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3649</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Allan Wilson: Waste and Emissions Trading Bill - UK Legislation</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament supports the principles of the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill 
and agrees that the provisions in the Bill that relate to devolved matters should 
be considered by the UK Parliament.</P><P>Supported by: Ross Finnie<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3648</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran: Domestic Abuse</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament approves the considerable progress made in increasing the protection 
of, and provision of services to, women, children and young people experiencing 
domestic abuse; further approves work aimed at reducing the intolerably high incidence 
of domestic abuse in Scotland, and welcomes the work of the National Group to 
Address Domestic Abuse in Scotland in tackling this unacceptable behaviour.</P><P>Supported 
by: Hugh Henry<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3647#</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr 
Jamie Stone: Wick Ambulance Service</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
the vital work of the Wick ambulance service; is concerned at the lack of additional 
funding that was made available to the Highlands from the £22 million the Scottish 
Ambulance Service (SAS) received for modernisation; notes the long on-call working 
regime that means ambulance crews are often on duty for as much as 20 hours at 
a time and are routinely required to make long journeys of over 200 miles; is 
further concerned that crews suffer from sleep deprivation, possibly endangering 
themselves, their passengers and other road users, and asks the Scottish Executive 
and the SAS to urgently review the on-call working arrangements at Wick Ambulance 
Station, where staff are paid less than 90p per hour for being on-call, with a 
view to upgrading it from part-time on-call to full-time. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3646</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Fife Country Dance Festival 2002</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament extends its best wishes to the organisers and participants in the 
2002 Fife Schools Country Dance Festival, the largest festival of its kind in 
Britain, which is being held across the Kingdom between 20 and 29 November 2002 
involving over 12,000 primary and special education pupils.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3645 
Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Membership of Committee</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament agrees that Tricia Marwick be appointed to replace Duncan Hamilton 
on the Local Government Committee. </P><P>Supported by: Euan Robson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3644 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval

<STRONG> Tommy Sheridan: Firefighters' Strike</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
unreservedly condemns the Deputy Minister for Justice, Dr Richard Simpson MSP, 
for his remarks in relation to the firefighters&#146; dispute; believes that for 
a Minister in charge of the fire service to use the words, in relation to the 
firefighters&#146; dispute, &quot;fascists &#133; who would follow Mussolini&quot; 
is a disgrace and can only influence the current industrial dispute; calls on 
the Minister to apologise unreservedly to the firefighters and the trade union 
movement, and also believes he can no longer be in charge of the fire service 
in Scotland and should resign or be sacked by the First Minister.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3641</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Bill Aitken: Drug Courts</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the growing 
prevalence of drug abuse and drug-related crimes; regrets that the Scottish Executive 
continues to send out mixed messages on drugs; further regrets that the Executive&#146;s 
flagship drug courts have become a means of avoiding a prison term, and therefore 
calls on the Executive to ensure that (a) those sent to drug courts have committed 
only a minimal number of offences, (b) there are sufficient resources to ensure 
that those who are sentenced by drug courts have the option of immediate and instant 
treatment to undergo rehabilitation and (c) any breach of orders from the drug 
courts are dealt with properly. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3640</STRONG> <STRONG>Des 
McNulty: Finance Committee, <em>Public Private Partnerships</em></STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the 5th report 2002 of the Finance Committee, <em>Public Private 
Partnerships </em>(SP Paper 653), and commends the report&#146;s recommendations 
to the Scottish Executive.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3639#</STRONG> <STRONG>Bill Butler: 
Firefighters' Dispute</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes with deep concern 
the beginning of the second phase of the firefighters&#146; dispute which is due 
to last for eight days; acknowledges the widespread disappointment and frustration 
at the breakdown of talks between the Fire Brigades Union and local authority 
employers on the morning of 22 November 2002, talks which had come so close to 
arriving at a settlement acceptable to both sides; recognises that everyone involved 
remains very anxious, given the risk to the general public&#146;s health and safety, 
to seek an agreement that is acceptable to all sides speedily brokered, and considers 
that the Scottish Executive should make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s 
Government to urge it to do all in its power to help provide the conditions that 
would enable a settlement to be concluded and one which would recognise the aspirations 
of firefighters for professional status and pay.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3638</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Fitzpatrick: "Crossing Borders", the 38th Annual Conference of the 
Royal Musical Association </STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament applauds the hard 
work and commitment of all concerned in securing "Crossing Borders", the 38th 
Annual Conference of the Royal Musical Association hosted jointly by the University 
of Glasgow and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, in association with 
the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, and to be held in Glasgow from 28 November 
to 1 December 2002; notes that the Royal Musical Association was founded in 1874, 
that the association is the second oldest learned musical society in the world 
and that this is its first annual conference to take place in Scotland, and recognises 
the sterling contribution the Conference might make to exploring the boundaries 
between research and practice, the academy and the profession, music and other 
disciplines with contributions from UK and international speakers and musicians 
and to promoting vigorous topical debate on the arts, live music and the best 
of international scholarship together with supporting world-class performances 
including the opening night of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra&#146;s Prokofiev 
series conducted by Alexander Lazarev and Haydn Trio Eisenstadt making their debut 
UK appearance, together with Lorna Anderson and Jamie MacDougall, in a programme 
marking the first modern publication of Haydn's collected Scottish and Welsh airs, 
edited by Marjorie Rycroft of the University of Glasgow Music Department.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3637*#</STRONG>*<STRONG>Jackie 
Baillie: Argyll and Clyde NHS Acute Hospitals Trust</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes the apparent difficulty of Argyll and Clyde NHS Acute Hospitals Trust in 
managing to provide a full range of services to meet the needs of the local population; 
further notes the resignation of key health service personnel over the last few 
months and the failure of management to recruit, which has led to instability 
and uncertainty over the future of service provision in the area, particularly 
at the Vale of Leven District General Hospital; recognises and applauds the commitment 
of front-line staff, doctors, nurses, auxiliaries and others, in maintaining excellent 
standards of health care for people in the area; notes the welcome intervention 
of the Minister for Health and Community Care in sending in a support team to 
consider and act on any management failures, and *asks* the Scottish Executive 
and Argyll and Clyde NHS Board to act quickly on the recommendations made by the 
support team to restore professional and public confidence in the service.</P><P>Supported

they&#146;re fascists&#133;&quot;*;* if the comments do not represent the view

amendment to motion (S1M-3560) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;but,

&quot;ethical principles&quot; before genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are 
released or placed on the market, as highlighted in the preamble to Directive 
2001/18/EC, and that the regulations (a) narrow the existing definition of &quot;harm&quot; 
from GMOs under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 instead of retaining the 
existing definition which includes harm to property, (b) weaken the existing definition 
in the Act of proper &quot;control&quot; of GMOs that currently requires any GMOs 
that enter the environment to be &quot;harmless&quot;, to only having to &quot;minimise 
the risk of harm&quot;, (c) allow the requirement for information to be contained 
in an application for consent to release/market GMOs, as required in the Directive, 
to be varied &quot;to the extent that such information is appropriate to the nature 
and scale of the release or application&quot; but do not require full information 
to be provided according to Annex III of the Directive for any release of GMOs, 
(d) reduce the current powers of Scottish ministers to &quot;revoke a consent 
at any time&quot; to instead only allowing a consent to be revoked if &quot;new 
information&quot; comes to light and (e) provide for joint powers with the Health 
and Safety Executive to refuse a consent on health grounds rather than such powers 
being retained solely with Scottish Ministers.&quot; </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3558 Tobacco
