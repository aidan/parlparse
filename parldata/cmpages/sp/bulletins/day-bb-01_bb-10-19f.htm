            business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p>*<strong>S1M-2333</strong>#<strong> Tricia Marwick: Committee of the Regions</strong>-That 
            the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should recommend 
            to Her Majesty's Government that all of Scotland's representation 
            on the Committee of the Regions should be elected councillors.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2332</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Devolution of Broadcasting</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the threat to 16,000 media jobs in Scotland caused 
            by a downturn in advertising revenue; recognises that of particular 
            concern arising from this downturn is the call for voluntary redundancies 
            at STV and Grampian by the Scottish Media Group and the possible reductions 
            in regional programming on these stations, despite the fact that the 
            level of such regional programming is set within current broadcasting 
            licences; recalls that legislative responsibility for broadcasting 
            was an original part of the devolution package although later removed 
            at the insistence of New Labour; accepts that the best context for 
            helping broadcasting and the other media in Scotland can only be created 
            by a Scottish Parliament with appropriate powers to do so working 
            in partnership with the media and within a modern European regulatory 
            context; is persuaded that without such powers Scotland will have 
            no ability to influence the development of digital media and developing 
            global structures, and therefore calls upon Her Majesty's Government 
            to legislate to devolve responsibility for broadcasting legislation 
            to the Scottish Parliament at the earliest possible date.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2331#</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Scottish Agricultural College, 
            Auchincruive </strong>-That the Parliament recognises the important contribution 
            made by the Scottish Agricultural College's Auchincruive Campus to 
            food, land and environmental studies in Scotland; notes that the campus 
            is Scotland's largest agricultural educational facility; further recognises 
            the valuable contribution made to the Ayrshire economy by the campus, 
            particularly its vital role at the heart of the bio-science industry 
            in the west of Scotland, and express its hope that this contribution 
            will be fully acknowledged during the forthcoming review of the Scottish 
            Agricultural College's operations.<strong><i> R</i></strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2330</strong> <strong>Angus MacKay: Freedom of Information (Scotland) 
            Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>-That the Parliament, for the purposes 
            of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Freedom of 
            Information (Scotland) Bill, agrees to the following expenditure out 
            of the Scottish Consolidated Fund -</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>(a) expenditure of the Scottish Administration in consequence of 
            the Act; and </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>(b) increases attributable to the Act in the sums payable out of 
            that Fund under any other enactment.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace<strong>*</strong>, Iain Gray<strong>*</strong>, Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2329</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Afghanistan</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes the UN warning of a humanitarian crisis of 'stunning 
            proportions' unfolding in Afghanistan which will leave over five million 
            people, the vast majority women and children, with a 'fragile grip 
            on survival' this winter; believes that the grief and suffering of 
            innocent victims in the United States of America cannot be answered 
            by the bombing and starvation of equally innocent victims in Afghanistan; 
            recognises that the bombing of Afghanistan has resulted in tens of 
            thousands more people leaving their homes, has handed a daily propaganda 
            victory to terrorists and has caused substantial civilian deaths and 
            injuries; agrees with Mary Robinson, the UN Human Rights Commissioner, 
            that 'it is very hard to get convoys of food in when there is a military 
            campaign,' and calls on Her Majesty's Government to halt the bombing 
            and urge the United States to do likewise.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2328</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Railways</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that the railways belong to the people of Britain and that 
            no compensation should therefore be paid to private shareholders of 
            Railtrack; further believes that the operating company should also 
            be taken back into public ownership, and considers that a new democratic 
            structure involving workers and users of the industry should be established 
            to ensure real democratic control of our railways north and south 
            of the border. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2327</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Binny House, Ecclesmachan, West 
            Lothian</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the current financial 
            crisis at the Sue Ryder Care home, Binny House, Ecclesmachan, West 
            Lothian, which provides intensive residential support and respite 
            care for sufferers of degenerative disorders such as multiple sclerosis 
            and Parkinson's Disease and calls on the Scottish Executive, Lothian 
            Health and the local authorities which use the facility to co-operate 
            with Sue Ryder Care in seeking to avert the threatened closure of 
            the home. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2326</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Importance of the Construction 
            Industry</strong>-That the Parliament notes the importance of the construction 
            industry to the Scottish economy and the public and the prevalence 
            of unqualified &quot;cowboy firms&quot; in the industry; calls upon 
            Her Majesty's Government to make use of annex K of EU Directive 77/388/EEC 
            to reduce the rate of VAT on repair work to 5%, and further calls 
            upon Her Majesty's Government to introduce a statutory registration 
            scheme incorporating an insurance-based guarantee of work with respect 
            to building firms.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2325</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Liquid-based Cytology/Human Papilloma 
            Virus Test</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the liquid-based 
            cytology/human papilloma virus test should be available to all women 
            across Scotland on the NHS free of charge to increase cervical cancer 
            detection rates, given (a) the fact that it has a higher accuracy 
            rate than screening by the cervical smear test and (b) the potential 
            it has for detecting the disease in 40% of women who go on to develop 
            this type of cancer, for reducing spending on treating cervical cancer 
            by 23% and for reducing the need for examinations by specialists by 
            70%, and calls on the Scottish Executive to reinstate funding for 
            the pilot projects at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Monklands, Ninewells 
            and Raigmore hospitals. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2324</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Clarkston Disaster, October 
            1971</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 30th anniversary of the Clarkston 
            Disaster in October, 1971, one of the most shocking moments in modern 
            Scottish history when a normal day of shopping at a local centre exploded 
            into one of the worst gas disasters ever suffered; pays tribute to 
            the families of those who died for the long years in which they have 
            endured the loss of wives, mothers and fathers; remembers the many 
            injured, some of whom are afflicted to this day by the severe injuries 
            which they received; further notes that the indelible memories of 
            those who were present that day included witnessing the courage and 
            compassion of police, fire and ambulance services and also the loving 
            care of the people of Clarkston and the WRVS for the wounded, and 
            regrets that no proper memorial exists for the dead of the Clarkston 
            disaster and questions why not. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2323</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry: Auchenlodment Primary School, Johnstone</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates Auchenlodment Primary School in Johnstone 
            on its 40th anniversary; recognises the school's contribution to Johnstone 
            and the wider community and the hard work of both the staff and pupils 
            in their efforts to make the school environmentally friendly, and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to support all schools in their 
            efforts not only to teach children the benefits of environmental awareness 
            but also to make their schools as environmentally friendly as possible.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2322</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry: Have a Heart Paisley</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes the report by the Coronary Heart Disease/Stroke Task 
            Force, which concluded that the rate of heart disease deaths in Scotland 
            had dropped by 40% in the past 10 years; recognises the work of 'Have 
            a Heart Paisley' which has the aim of reducing heart disease and promoting 
            healthier and longer lives for the residents of Paisley; acknowledges 
            that the project has not only brought the community together but also 
            health professionals and local organisations, working in partnership 
            for a lasting improvement in the health and well being of everyone 
            in Paisley, and believes that the Scottish Executive could learn from 
            'Have a Heart Paisley' and use the project as a benchmark for other 
            initiatives to help prevent heart disease throughout Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2312</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Scots Language Educational Materials</strong>-That 
            the Parliament<a name="MotionText"></a> welcomes the grant of £150,000 
            awarded to the Itchy Coo Project from the Scottish Arts Council's 
            National Lottery Children and Young People Scheme which will transform 
            the image and status of the Scots language by providing resources 
            for use throughout the education system from nursery to advanced higher 
            level; notes that over the two years of the project, beginning in 
            January 2002, Itchy Coo will produce sixteen Scots texts and other 
            resources, including original works, both creative and non-fiction 
            titles, as well as new and innovative versions of Scots literary texts 
            aimed at specific age groups; approves of the participation of children 
            in the way the books are developed and the inclusion of ideas for 
            children to write or perform creatively; further notes that there 
            will be an interactive web-site that will solicit and showcase children's 
            own language creations, that the project also includes a programme 
            of in-service training for teachers and school visits from Itchy Coo 
            authors and editors and that the partnership will work to advance 
            teachers' and young people's knowledge of the language and to develop 
            their confidence in their usage of Scots; is especially pleased to 
            note that the project will have a strong social inclusion element 
            and take account of the needs of children and young people with disabilities 
            and special needs; acknowledges that this will enable thousands of 
            young Scots to articulate and appreciate their own language and culture 
            in ways that have seldom been available to them before; therefore 
            regrets that, in contrast, the Scottish Executive has confirmed in 
            recent responses that it has set no targets for and has not formulated 
            a policy on the numbers of Scots speakers, and deplores the fact that 
            it does not consider any action is necessary to comply with the European 
            Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of the Scots 
            language.</p>
