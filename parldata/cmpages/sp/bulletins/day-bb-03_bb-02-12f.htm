recognises the severity of the crisis facing the Scottish fishing industry; believes 
that the effects of the conservation measures already taken by Scottish fishermen 
have not been taken into full consideration; notes the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
£50 million aid package but questions the balance of the allocation between decommissioning 
and transitional funding, and further notes that the Common Fisheries Policy of 
collective management has been disastrous for the Scottish fishing industry and 
must be replaced, and that only a move to national and local control will bring 
sustainability to the Scottish fishing industry in the future.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3884</STRONG>

support measures for the catching and onshore sectors that will keep the industry 
intact; believes that European and HM Treasury support should be provided to fund 
these measures, and further calls on the Scottish Executive to urgently renegotiate 
the fisheries deal agreed by Her Majesty&#146;s Government in December in order 
to secure a fair level of fishing opportunities for the Scottish fleet.</P><P>Supported

of their children; recognises the key role of all educators in giving our young 
people instruction and formation that is respectful of shared truths, the qualities 
of the heart and the moral and spiritual dignity of humankind; welcomes the important 
past, present and future contributions of Catholic schools to the better education 
and national life of Scotland; notes the success of many denominational schools 
in fostering school ethos and, in particular, in improving the academic achievements 
of disadvantaged youngsters; affirms and supports the right of all parents to 
choose Catholic schools for their children, and extends its best wishes to all 
involved in preparations for events taking place for Catholic Education Sunday

<STRONG>Miss Annabel Goldie: Scottish Economic Growth</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment

to end and insert &quot;competitive disadvantage at which Scottish business is 
being placed as a consequence of an onerous taxation and regulatory regime aggravated 
by inadequate investment in transport infrastructure and calls on the Scottish 
Executive to reduce the business rate poundage to the same level that exists in 
England thereby re-establishing a uniform business rate and to pledge an additional 
£100 million per annum for investment in our transport infrastructure.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3880.2</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Lewis Macdonald: Scottish Economic Growth</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment 
to motion (S1M-3880) in the name of Andrew Wilson, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;supports the Scottish Executive&#146;s aim of increasing 
sustainable economic growth over the long term; recognises that increasing Scotland&#146;s 
prosperity is essential to the fulfilment of the Executive&#146;s objectives of 
closing the opportunity gap, building first-class public services and ensuring 
sustainable development; calls for all leaders in Scottish public life to work 
towards a national consensus around the drive to bridge the gap between Scotland&#146;s 
economic performance and economic potential, and endorses the work being undertaken 
by the Executive to use the powers of the Parliament to help business grow and 
to secure a smart, successful Scotland by developing the science and skills base, 
improving global connections and investing in transport and communications infrastructure.&quot;

<STRONG>Nicol Stephen: Education</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3879) 
in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end 
and insert &quot;welcomes the strategy for the future of education in Scotland 
published in <EM>Educating for Excellence: Choice and Opportunity</EM> with its 
focus on raising standards and closing the opportunity gap; supports the plans 
to reduce class sizes and the measures to improve literacy and numeracy and to 
ease transitions between key stages, and endorses the strategy&#146;s key objectives 
of an education system centred on the needs of each individual child with a more 
flexible and relevant curriculum, a streamlined assessment system and greater 
parental involvement in our schools.&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3879.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Education</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3879) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from 
&quot;in places&quot; to end and insert &quot;the response of the Scottish National 
Party has been to advocate policies which, whilst well-intentioned, would require 
placing requests to be abolished, catchment areas to be re-drawn and, therefore, 
parental choice to be considerably restricted, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
to reaffirm its support for the placing request provisions of the Education (Scotland) 
Act 1981.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3876.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: 
Funding for Local Roads</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3876) in 
the name of Dr Sylvia Jackson, leave out from &quot;for a number of decades&quot; 
and insert &quot;this sum, though welcome, is but a fraction of the amount needed 
to address the problem; notes that capital spending on the construction and improvement 
of local roads across Scotland during the four years up to 1997 was £562 million, 
compared with £326 million in the four years after 1997; further welcomes the 
report of Stirling Council&#146;s cross-party scrutiny group and its call for 
the Scottish Executive to reduce its ring-fencing of funding allocated to local 
authorities; further notes that the scrutiny group highlighted the policy decision 
of Stirling Council&#146;s current Labour/SNP administration to reduce the share 
of roads grant-aided expenditure (GAE) allocated to roads, so that in 2001-02 
only 65% of it was allocated to roads maintenance, compared with 126% in Perth 
and Kinross Council and a Scottish average of 103%; notes that, had Stirling Council&#146;s 
expenditure on roads maintenance been at 100% of roads GAE over the last six years, 
a further £9.8 million would have been spent on local roads in the district; understands 
that the SCOTS roads condition survey report, part-funded by the Scottish Executive, 
is now complete and believes that it should be published, and recognises that 
solving the problems affecting Stirling&#146;s roads requires a change of policy, 
from both the Scottish Executive and Stirling Council." </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3874.1</STRONG>

devolved to the Parliament and that any legislation that may be introduced to

Fire Service of the Future</EM> and must be subject to full and extensive scrutiny
