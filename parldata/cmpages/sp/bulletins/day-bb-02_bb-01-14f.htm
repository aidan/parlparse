            (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2600#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow to Edinburgh 
            Rail Service</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the current ScotRail dispute and the resulting cut in the Glasgow 
            to Edinburgh route to a half hourly rail service; urges the Scottish 
            Executive to make urgent representations to ScotRail to resolve the 
            dispute and to ensure the earliest possible reintroduction of the 
            15 minute service, and recognises the necessity for Scotland&#146;s 
            largest two conurbations to be linked by the best possible rail service. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2599</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Edinburgh's Bus 
            War</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns the recent demand from 
            Conservative leader David McLetchie that Lothian Buses, the last publicly 
            owned bus company in Scotland, be privatised noting that such a policy 
            would remove bus services needed by the most vulnerable in our society, 
            particularly pensioners, and services which are needed by the community 
            but which are not profitable, and notes that this new privatisation 
            policy from the Conservatives follows on from their discredited deregulation 
            of transport which has led to diminution of transport services including 
            bus services provision.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2598</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Maggie's 
            Centre</strong>&#151;That the Parliament warmly congratulates the 
            <em>Evening Times</em>, Glasgow, for a splendid example of positive 
            journalism in the public interest through the editor, staff and readers, 
            including child cancer patients, raising the remarkable sum of £500,000 
            to create a &quot;Maggie&#146;s Centre&quot; for cancer sufferers; 
            regards such work as a splendid example of the continuing power of 
            Scottish journalism to change lives for the better and of the astonishing 
            generosity of the public of Glasgow, and notes with pleasure that 
            a fine piece of once endangered Glasgow architecture, the Victorian 
            Gatehouse at the Western Infirmary, will be saved through becoming 
            a &quot;Maggie&#146;s Centre&quot;.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2597#</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Plight of 
            Chronic Pain Patients</strong>&#151;That the Parliament considers 
            that the Scottish Executive and health boards should move the plight 
            of chronic pain patients up the health agenda, chronic pain being 
            regarded as the most neglected health issue in Scotland and possibly 
            the biggest in terms of numbers as, according to the Pain Association 
            Scotland, some 500,000 people suffer long-term pain through problems 
            such as back pain and arthritic conditions, and agrees with health 
            professionals who have appealed to the Parliament that the wreckage 
            of many lives through lost jobs, and the loss of millions of pounds 
            to the economy, could be relieved by ending the dire shortage of specialised 
            pain clinics and staff in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2596</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Registration of 
            Civil Partnerships</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the proposed 
            legislation laid before Westminster that is designed to afford couples 
            in long-term relationships the right to legally register their relationships 
            and calls on the Executive to progress equivalent legislation to establish 
            a register of civil partnerships in Scotland and to afford couples 
            who register their partnerships full legal recognition in areas relating 
            to inheritance, pensions, bereavement, damages and all other relevant 
            areas.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2595 &#150; Withdrawn</strong></p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2594</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh: Nuclear Test Veterans</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes last month&#146;s ruling by the Pensions Appeal 
            Tribunal on Tom Duggan, a nuclear test veteran who served in the armed 
            forces during Britain&#146;s first A-bomb programme on Christmas Island 
            in 1958 and contracted lymphatic cancer following exposure to radiation; 
            notes that the tribunal&#146;s decision could finally prove to be 
            the decisive case that overturns decades of claims by Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government that the Christmas Island explosions could not have harmed 
            British servicemen; further notes the Ministry of Defence&#146;s refusal 
            to grant funding to a test pioneered at Dundee University that would 
            determine the effects of radiation on servicemen, and calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to demand justice for all test veterans and take 
            action where Her Majesty&#146;s Government has failed by granting 
            the £300,000 necessary to carry out these tests.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2593</strong> <strong>Ian Jenkins: Chernobyl Children 
            Life Line Link with the Scottish Borders</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            commends the work of Chernobyl Children Life Line, which offers medical 
            help and holidays to young victims of on-going radioactive contamination 
            in Belarus; welcomes the formation of a link between this national 
            charity and the Scottish Borders, and applauds its efforts to bring 
            groups of youngsters to the Scottish Borders for a restorative and 
            life-enhancing stay in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2592#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Continuing 
            Presence of BSE and new variant CJD </strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the continuing presence of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy 
            (BSE) in Scotland and the growing numbers of cases of new variant 
            Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), including at least two cases in the 
            parliamentary constituency of Eastwood; welcomes the setting up of 
            a National Care Co-ordinator and CJD advice network, but acknowledges 
            the devastating effects this disease can have on victims and their 
            families and believes that the Scottish Executive should give its 
            continuing support to those families affected by this terrible disease.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2591#</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Draft Guidance 
            for Home Education</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned 
            at the Scottish Executive issuing for consultation draft guidance 
            on the circumstances in which parents may choose to educate their 
            children at home, without taking proper account of the views of children 
            and parents affected by this; does not support this action and recognises 
            the considerable alarm its issue has generated within the home education 
            community and the damage which it is likely to cause to relationships 
            between families and education authorities; further recognises the 
            fundamental human rights of parents and children to choose education 
            outwith school and without being obstructed by the state; notes that 
            section 14 of the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc. Act 2000, under 
            which this draft guidance was issued, was introduced to protect home 
            educating families from any harassment or intimidation by education 
            authorities, as evidenced by an independent report from the Scottish 
            Consumer Council; further notes that section 14 was supported by the 
            Parliament on condition that the content of the guidance was fully 
            informed by home educating families; refutes the consultation document's 
            unfounded and insulting inferences that home educated children are 
            in need of extraordinary measures of care and protection due to the 
            exercise of a lawful educational choice which is equally valid to 
            schooling; considers that the guidance exhorts local authorities to 
            act beyond their powers under section 37 of the Education (Scotland) 
            Act 1980 and seeks to condone unlawful breaches of data protection 
            and human rights legislation; believes that the Minister for Education 
            and Young People should apologise to the home education community 
            in Scotland and withdraw the consultation document immediately on 
            the grounds that the Scottish Executive has no authority to approve 
            such breaches, and, in the light of its failure to address the serious 
            issues raised in the Scottish Consumer Council's report and the many 
            concerns of families who will be affected by such guidance, considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should end the discrimination against 
            home educating families in Scotland forthwith by amending the necessary 
            laws to afford them the same legal rights as those families in England, 
            whereby children may be removed from state schools upon a written 
            notification.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2590</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Motion by Jack 
            McConnell on Student Loans</strong>&#151;That the Parliament affirms 
            that &quot;education is a right and not a privilege to be paid for, 
            that a student loans system would seriously affect the numbers of 
            students who come from working class and ethnic minority backgrounds 
            and would decrease the number of mature and women students entering 
            higher education, and that instead of considering a loans system, 
            the Government should be removing the means test and providing a full 
            grant for all&quot;; and notes that the above is the text of a motion 
            moved by Jack McConnell at a General Meeting of the Students&#146; 
            Association on 29 September 1980 when a student at Stirling University 
            and congratulates him on his sentiments then.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2588#</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: Renewable 
            Energy in the Western Isles</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            the development of the proposed renewable energy projects on the Isle 
            of Lewis; recognises the substantial potential socio-economic and 
            environmental benefits that they offer; congratulates the Stornoway 
            Trust Estate for its professional handling of developments to date, 
            and believes that ministers and officials of the Scottish Executive 
            and Her Majesty&#146;s Government should continue their excellent 
            partnership working with all relevant agencies.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2586</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Winter Maintenance 
            of North East Roads</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls on the 
            Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning to investigate 
            the performance of BEAR Scotland Ltd and councils in the north east 
            in maintaining roads and pavements in a safe condition during the 
            recent spell of well forecasted adverse weather.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Michael Matheson, Nora Radcliffe</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2585#</strong> <strong>Angus MacKay: The Colin O'Riordan 
            Trust </strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the outstanding 
            contribution made by the late Dr Colin O'Riordan to the provision 
            of access to music for all children in Edinburgh, and particularly 
            Sciennes Primary School, and throughout Scotland, in founding the 
            City of Edinburgh Music School and in the many youth orchestra activities 
            with which he was associated, and congratulates his family on the 
            foundation of the Colin O'Riordan Trust, which aims to assist aspiring 
            young musicians by promoting musical excellence and improving access 
            to musical instruments for those children who might otherwise not 
            have the opportunity to pursue music.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rhoda Grant, Irene McGugan, Trish Godman, Brian Fitzpatrick, 
            Mr Brian Monteith, Sarah Boyack, Margaret Smith, Nora Radcliffe, Mr 
            Keith Harding, Ms Margo MacDonald</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2584</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Power 
            Industrial Dispute</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the 
            strike action of Scottish Power workers in pursuit of their agreement 
            of 31 May 2000 with Scottish Power management which stated that no 
            job losses and no fundamental changes to conditions would result from 
            the trade unions&#146; agreement to work in partnership alongside 
            the company; regrets that Scottish Power management is now reneging 
            on this agreement and is intent on fundamentally changing working 
            conditions, which includes transferring staff against their will to 
            a new joint venture company; notes that this has resulted in a democratic 
            ballot of union members within Scottish Power; further notes union 
            members&#146; decision to take part in a series of two-day strike 
            actions, and therefore calls on the management of Scottish Power to 
            end its confrontational stance and honour the agreement it signed 
            in good faith with the unions in order to avoid any further inconvenience 
            to Scottish citizens, particularly in relation to power cuts and consequential 
            safety issues.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2581</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Perth Royal 
            Infirmary Laboratory Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            the discussion document produced by Tayside University Hospitals NHS 
            Trust on the future of laboratory services at Perth Royal Infirmary 
            (PRI); recognises that upheaval and uncertainty have been the hallmark 
            of health service provision in Perthshire in recent years and that 
            patients, staff and the general public require a period of stability; 
            welcomes the recognition within the document that, as an Acute Hospital 
            with the full range of District General Hospital Services, PRI will 
            require on-site laboratory services for biochemical medicine, haematology 
            and blood transfusion &quot;at the very least&quot;; acknowledges 
            the strong arguments put forward for relocating laboratory facilities 
            closer to the wards, and rejects suggestions that pathology and microbiology 
            services be relocated to Ninewells Hospital.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John Swinney, Bruce Crawford, Michael Matheson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2580</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Education (Disability 
            Strategies and Pupils' Records) (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils&#146; 
            Records) (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure payable 
            out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson, Nicol Stephen, Peter Peacock</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2579#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Non-Trunk Roads</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that the first serious winter weather has resulted 
            in non-trunk roads in the Highlands being in an extremely dangerous 
            condition; recognises that this has come about as a result of the 
            Highland Council downsizing its winter roads maintenance service as 
            a result of the trunk roads maintenance contract being awarded to 
            BEAR Scotland Ltd, and accordingly considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should undertake an urgent review of all roads maintenance in the 
            Highland Council area in order to avoid any future repetition of the 
            recent dangerous problems.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2576</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Instrumental Teaching 
            in Schools and Support for Music</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the application of the criterion of &quot;ability 
            to pay&quot; in relation to access to instrumental teaching, which 
            is a crucial element of the music curriculum at Standard and Higher 
            Still grades in schools; believes that such teaching should be available 
            to all children, free at the point of delivery, and calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to examine the structural underfunding of music 
            which exists and adopt all necessary measures to ensure that every 
            element and genre of musical activity is properly supported and developed
