<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5409</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Drinking Is Not a Crime But Rape Is</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Rape Awareness Campaign launched by Lothian and Borders Police in conjunction with Rape Crisis Scotland and the Edinburgh Women&rsquo;s Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre; notes that the campaign involves police officers, police staff and special constables handing out specially designed postcards depicting women enjoying themselves socially with the direct message that &quot;drinking is not a crime.... but rape is&quot;; supports the decision by Lothian and Borders Police to focus a public safety campaign on the clear message that women are not to blame for rape just because they have been drinking; recognises awareness-raising work being done by police and voluntary sector organisations across Scotland, including the washroom campaign launched on 10 December 2009 by Glasgow Community and Safety Services, which involves posters from Rape Crisis Scotland&rsquo;s <em>This is not an invitation to rape me</em> campaign being placed in bars and clubs across the city for one month, and wishes these campaigns every success in their efforts to challenge unacceptable attitudes towards rape.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5408</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Network Change Programme in Argyll and Bute: A Case Study</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Consumer Focus Scotland&rsquo;s research report, <em>The Network Change Programme in Argyll and Bute: A Case Study</em>, which examines the impact of post office closures on consumers in the Argyll and Bute area; believes that this empowering research, which engaged directly with people affected by the closures, highlights important lessons about the weaknesses in the consultation process and the impact that the programme has had on local communities, and further believes that the report&rsquo;s recommendations should be carefully considered by Post Office Ltd and acted on now in order to address the concerns expressed by consumers and also to inform any future consultations on changes to the post office network in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5407</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Hawick Learning Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Hawick Learning Community on its Vision 2014 project, which was recently exhibited in the Scottish Parliament; notes that the project was presented by pupils from Stirches Primary School, Newcastleton Primary School, Denholm Primary School, Hobkirk Primary School, Drumlanrig Primary School, Wilton Primary School, Trinity Primary School, St Margaret&rsquo;s Primary School, Burnfoot Community School and Hawick High School; recognises the hard work that went into the preparation of the project by both pupils and staff and the enthusiasm with which it was presented, and wishes success to all schools involved as they work toward the celebration year of 2014.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5406</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Cuts to Army Cadet Force</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the UK Government plans to cut the Army Cadet Force budget by &pound;4 million; notes the UK Government&rsquo;s turnaround on residency rights for the Gurkhas and planned cuts to the Territorial Army; considers that the army cadets are the soldiers of tomorrow and that these short-sighted cuts risk the future of an organisation that has given young people a taste of military discipline and leadership for nearly 150 years, and therefore calls on the UK Government to abandon proposed cuts to the Army Cadet Force.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5405</strong> <strong>Andrew Welsh on behalf of the Finance Committee:</strong> <strong>7th Report 2009 (Session 3) of the Finance Committee on Scrutiny of the Draft Budget 2010-11</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 7th Report 2009 (Session 3) of the Finance Committee on the scrutiny of the Draft Budget 2010-11 (SP Paper 349) and refers the report and its recommendations to the Scottish Government for consideration.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5389#</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Save Our Car Park Campaign, Kirkcaldy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Save Our Car Park campaign in Kirkcaldy in which High Street retailers, members of the public, politicians and <em>The Fife Free Press</em> have rejected a proposal by Fife Council to build a local swimming pool on the busiest public car park serving Kirkcaldy High Street; considers that space restrictions on the site mean that the pool could not be extended to include fit-for-purpose dry sports facilities when funding became available; also considers that having the pool in this location will take away key car parking facilities for the town centre and will be detrimental to the work that has been done by retailers on the High Street to boost the local economy; further considers the overwhelming opposition to Fife Council&rsquo;s decision, with campaigners collecting over 2,000 signatures in support; recognises that those opposing the choice of location include large and small town centre traders, shoppers, car park users, Kirkcaldy Area Sports Council, sports clubs, pool users and individuals throughout Kirkcaldy, and believes the scope of the consultation conducted by Fife Council to have been inadequate, as demonstrated through widespread public opposition to the decision.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5384</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>EU Tax on Mobility Scooters is Tax on Disability</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that in 2007 49% of Scottish disabled people were workless, that the risk of poverty in a household was far higher if the household contained a disabled adult and that, according to the Department for Work and Pensions report, <em>Family Resources Survey, United Kingdom, 2007-08,</em> 24% of individuals in disabled households were in poverty compared with only 14% of individuals in non-disabled households; further notes that the reclassification of mobility scooters by the European Commission means that they are now subject to a 10% import tax and that this could in many cases be passed on to the consumer; therefore believes that this reclassification amounts to a tax on disabled people, and joins the charity, Elizabeth Finn Care, in calling on the UK Government to press the commission to reverse this decision or introduce measures in the UK that will ensure that the hardship of some of the most financially vulnerable people in society is not increased.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5363</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Nuclear Waste at Dounreay,  Now You See It, Now You Don&rsquo;t</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the nuclear regulator, to fully investigate the circumstances surrounding the reappearance of part of the 170kg of enriched uranium that was first reported as being lost and then reported as an accountancy error in that the material was not missing but never existed in the first place; further calls for those in authority who are responsible for public announcements on decommissioning at Dounreay to stop spinning stories after the fact that infer that highly enriched uranium, which is not accounted for nor can be found, is in any event safe, and expects them to clean up not only nuclear waste but also their public announcements.</p>
