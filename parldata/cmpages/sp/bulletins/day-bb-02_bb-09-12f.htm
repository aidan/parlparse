<STRONG>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Arnold Kemp</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament pays 
tribute to the magnificent service rendered to Scotland by Arnold Kemp, former 
editor of <em>The Herald </em>newspaper and latterly former news editor of <em>The 
Observer</em>; recognises him as a great and heroic editor, in both Scottish and 
European terms, who campaigned steadfastly for Scottish devolution and humanitarian 
causes and who, like his late father Robert Kemp, was an influence for enduring 
good, delivering his outstanding intellectual gifts with the sparkle of grace, 
style, kindness and humour, and extends its deep sympathy to Mr Kemp's family 
and partner on his untimely loss to them and to Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3384#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Iain Smith: Review of Secondary School Accommodation in North East Fife</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament believes that Fife Council should conduct an urgent review of secondary 
school accommodation in the north-east Fife area, including examining the feasibility 
of a new secondary school to serve north Fife, the creation of a single-site school 
for Madras College, St Andrews, and ensuring that Waid Academy in Anstruther has 
sufficient accommodation to meet future demand.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3383#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Government Campaign to Run Down Glasgow</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow <em>Evening Times</em> for its excellent 
expos&eacute; of Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s 25-year campaign to run 
down Glasgow; notes with concern that official documents provide evidence of official 
efforts to keep new industry and jobs out of Glasgow, move existing firms and 
jobs from Glasgow and drive Glasgow citizens into new towns; further notes with 
concern that the <em>Evening Times&#146;</em> report suggests that Glasgow is still 
the victim of institutionalised bias, and therefore believes that the Scottish 
Executive should consider urgently measures to halt any continuing anti-Glasgow 
bias and adopt policies and provide investment which will end Glasgow&#146;s decline 
and aid its regeneration.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3382.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Bruce Crawford: 
Spending Review 2002</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3382) in the 
name of Ross Finnie, leave out &quot;commends&quot; and insert &quot;notes&quot;.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3382.2</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr David Davidson: Spending Review 2002</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment 
to motion (S1M-3382) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;notes the Scottish Executive&#146;s spending plans for 
2003-04 to 2005-06, which are funded as a result of the swingeing increases in 
taxation which were a feature of the 2002 UK Budget; expresses concern about the 
sustainability of such levels of expenditure; believes that without major reform 
of public services the proposed spending increases will not produce the value 
for money improvements expected by the Scottish people, and calls on the Scottish 
Executive to provide a boost to the economy by reducing the burden of business 
rates&quot;.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3377 Scottish Football</STRONG> (lodged on 10 September

<STRONG>Miss Annabel Goldie: Performance of the Scottish Economy</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3376) in the name of Andrew Wilson, leave out from 
&quot;this recession&quot; to end and insert &quot;economic growth is the key 
to raising personal living standards, providing opportunity and security for all 
and the means by which we improve our public services and quality of life; further 
recognises that this prosperity can only be created on a sound entrepreneurial 
base, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to increase investment in 
our transport infrastructure and to return Scotland to a uniform business rate 
poundage throughout the United Kingdom, these being two essential factors in providing 
the right framework for the creation of wealth and jobs.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3376.2</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Iain Gray: Performance of the Scottish Economy</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment 
to motion (S1M-3376) in the name of Andrew Wilson, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;endorses the Scottish Executive&#146;s aim to increase 
the sustainable growth of the Scottish economy over the long term, using the powers 
available to the Parliament, thus providing resources for first-class public services 
and a more socially just and sustainable Scotland; supports the work undertaken 
to improve the long-term performance of the Scottish economy as set out in the 
<em>Framework for Economic Development</em> and <em>Smart, Successful Scotland</em>, 
and notes the progress in implementing measures to help businesses grow, build 
Scotland&#146;s global connections and improve Scotland&#146;s skills base.&quot;

<STRONG>*S1M-3375.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Malcolm Chisholm: Acute Services Review</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3375) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, <A NAME="AmendmentText">leave 
out from &quot;considers&quot; to end and insert &quot;accepts that the status 
quo is not an option and that improvements and modernisation must be progressed 
as soon as possible in order to enhance the quality of care; recognises that this 
is a long-term plan which must be flexible enough to take account of changing 
service demands and developing medical practice; supports an on-going monitoring 
and review process that includes external independent audit by Audit Scotland 
on an annual basis; endorses a commitment to keep named services at Stobhill and 
Victoria over the next five years and to have this locally monitored; gives high 
priority to the acceleration of ambulatory care and diagnostics developments in 
consultation with local communities; recognises the particular concern over the 
number of accident and emergency departments and supports a review of this in 
two years time that involves staff, patient and community groups, Glasgow Health 
Council and the Scottish Royal Colleges, and welcomes current developments in 
the Scottish Ambulance Service which will include the near doubling of paramedics 
in Glasgow by 2005 and one paramedic in the crew of each front-line ambulance.&quot;</A>

<STRONG>Elaine Smith: Abolition of the Record of Needs System</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">notes the genuine fears of parents and organisations 
over the proposed abolition of the Record of Needs system for children with special 
educational needs; expresses concern that the alternative proposal of a &quot;Co-ordinated 
Support Plan&quot; has not been clearly defined; believes that the &quot;Co-ordinated 
Support Plan&quot; will result in a reduction of legal rights for children and 
their parents; further expresses concern that local authorities are not required 
to carry out a fully comprehensive series of assessments and that &quot;Co-ordinated 
Support Plans&quot; can only be reviewed every three years, and proposes that 
consideration be given instead to retaining and improving the current Record of 
Needs System. </A></P><P>Supported by: Robin Harper<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3340#
