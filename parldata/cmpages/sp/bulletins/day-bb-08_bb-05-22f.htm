<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1966</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Boiling Point for School Kitchens</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament opposes any move by the SNP-led City of Edinburgh Council to close 14 of the 18 state nursery kitchens and several primary school kitchens across the city; rejects plans to replace hot nutritious school meals made onsite with transported meals and cold sandwiches made centrally; recognises the value of hot nutritious school meals being served at school, particularly to children in deprived areas; acknowledges the January 2008 HM Inspectorate of Education report, <em>Further Food for Thought</em>, that highlights the adverse effects to the quality and nutritional value of food when transported; believes that serving mass-produced school dinners from silver foil trays is an insult to the skills of local school cooks; further believes that this move contradicts the SNP&rsquo;s commitment to investing in and promoting healthy school meals; rejects the 10p increase on the price of school meals combined with budget cuts of &pound;10,000 for every primary and &pound;50,000 for every secondary school across the city of Edinburgh; believes that this contradicts all ministerial statements about the nutritional value of school meals; believes that a controversial decision of this nature should be made in consultation with pupils, parents and education officials rather than a back-door costcutting exercise by officials, and ultimately believes that the SNP, whether in the Parliament or in local government, will always put pounds signs before people and, in this case, Edinburgh&rsquo;s youngest and poorest children.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1965</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Safeguarding Scotland&rsquo;s Fishing Rights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch by the Scottish Government of the consultation, Safeguarding Scotland&rsquo;s Fishing Rights, which will review the management of Scotland&rsquo;s fish quota in order to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s fisheries have a sustainable future, prevent the introduction of individual transferable quotas which would effectively privatise Scotland&rsquo;s fishing quota, open up opportunities for new entrants to fisheries and ensure that fishing quotas are held by active fishermen, not so-called &quot;slipper skippers&quot; who do not use their quotas or who speculate in fishing quotas; urges Scotland&rsquo;s fishing community to engage with the consultation to deliver the best possible future management of Scotland&rsquo;s fisheries, and welcomes this new and innovative approach.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1964#</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Fife Energy Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of renewables in Scotland&rsquo;s energy equation; notes the endorsement by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth of the importance of the energy park, based at Methil, Fife; further notes that there is an active campaign to restore the rail link between Levenmouth and Thornton junction; recognises that the Levenmouth area which includes Methil is among the most deprived parts of Fife and that there is growing local concern about the apparent lack of progress in developing the energy park, and considers that the momentum must be maintained in putting Methil and Levenmouth firmly at the heart of Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy industry.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1963</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>New Rights for Agency Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement that will see agency workers gain the same workplace rights as permanent workers after 12 weeks in employment; believes that this will provide fairness for workers, while retaining flexibility for employers; notes that this equal treatment means the same working and employment conditions, including pay, holidays, overtime, breaks, rest periods, night work and duration of working time; further notes that these rights will be in addition to the existing rights that all workers currently enjoy, including the national minimum wage, 24 days holiday, statutory maternity pay, protection under anti-discrimination law and health and safety rules for adequate rest breaks at work; considers that this will be a positive step towards preventing bad employers from exploiting temporary workers and using agency workers to undercut the wages of permanent employees, and looks forward to the UK Government introducing this legislation in the autumn of 2008 and the benefits that it will bring for the 140,000 agency workers in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1962</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Pilrig Park School End-of-Year Performance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Pilrig Park School on the forthcoming public performance of its theatre arts course end-of-year show, which takes place for the third successive year at Edinburgh Festival Theatre on Friday 13 June 2008; notes that in addition to creating an entertaining show the event provides excellent training opportunities for the pupils who are involved in all aspects of the production from costume, set and programme design to ushering duties; congratulates the school for its success at teaching curriculum material through the arts, and wishes it every success for the big night.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1961</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>100th Anniversary of the Death of Old Tom Morris</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 24 May 2008 is the 100th anniversary of the death of Old Tom Morris, a native St Andrean and a pioneer of professional golf; recognises that Old Tom won the Open four times, including in 1867 at the age of 46, and that he still holds the record as the oldest Open winner as well as being part of the only father/son duo to be winner and runner-up; further notes that Old Tom was also a clubmaker, &quot;keeper of the greens&quot; at St Andrews Old Course and the designer responsible for remodelling some 75 courses from Muirfield to Prestwick and from Carnoustie to Askernish, South Uist, and considers that Old Tom more than anyone was responsible for establishing Scotland as the World Home of Golf.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1960#</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Holocaust Education in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament accepts the crucial importance of ensuring that the genocide of the Jewish and other peoples and minority groups inflicted during the Holocaust is never allowed to slip from public consciousness; welcomes the commitment of successive Scottish governments to developing a permanent National Holocaust Museum based in East Renfrewshire and looks forward to the fulfilment of that commitment; applauds the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust, among other organisations, for the role it plays in educating young people from every background about the Holocaust and the important lessons that can still be learned from it today, and considers that sufficient resources should be made available to allow schools across the west of Scotland and beyond to provide ongoing Holocaust education, with visits to the Auschwitz concentration camp being considered as part of that educational mix.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1959</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the series of amendments to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill which sought to reduce the time limit for abortion and were considered by the House of Commons on 20 May 2008; recognises that, while legislation in this area is currently reserved to Westminster, the delivery of clinical services, health promotion and sex education are all devolved responsibilities; further notes that the outcome of the Commons votes makes it likely that the time limit for abortion will remain unchanged; understands the strength of feeling on both sides of the debate but believes that both supporters and critics of abortion are concerned to reduce the number of unnecessary abortions; recognises the clear evidence base from Europe and around the world showing that good quality sex education and the free availability of contraception and sexual health services are key factors in achieving reduced abortion rates as well as other improvements in sexual and reproductive health and rights, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring renewed focus to its work on sexual and reproductive health, including a greater emphasis on comprehensive sex education for all, and a continued commitment to individual empowerment and women&rsquo;s reproductive rights.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1948</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>First Glasgow Fare Increases</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the recent bus fare increases of up to 25% by First Glasgow are unacceptable; notes that this includes raising the price of a child all-day ticket to &pound;2, that this will be too much for some families and that with the summer holidays just around the corner this comes at the worst possible time for them; further notes that the fare cap has been lifted by the Competition Commission partly due to rising fuel costs despite UK First Bus seeing an increase in its operating profits of 11% to &pound;122 million, a bigger jump than last year and far higher than FirstGroup as a whole which had a 7.6% increase in operating profits; believes that, with FirstGroup declaring preliminary profits of almost &pound;152 million, there is no need to put fares up in this way and that if it has a problem with the level of rising fuel prices it should make representations to the UK Exchequer and not pick on hard-pressed commuters, and calls on UK First Bus to rethink its pricing strategy or at the very least guarantee a future price freeze over a number of years.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1948.1</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>First Glasgow Fare Increases</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1948) in the name of Bob Doris, leave out from &quot;rising fuel costs&quot; to end and insert &quot;the refusal of the Scottish Government to provide rebates to bus operators in line with rebates provided by the UK Government to operators in England and Wales, leaving operators in Scotland with the highest fuel costs in the UK; highlights the inconsistency of the SNP government which claims to support modal shift from cars to public transport but whose policies in practice have led to the biggest increase in bus fares for a generation and the highest increase in train fares for a decade; expresses concern that Scottish Government ministers appear to be more worried about the interests of the shareholders of FirstGroup, which announced a record increase in its operating profits of 11% to &pound;122 million, than with passengers; believes that, with FirstGroup declaring preliminary profits of almost &pound;152 million, there is no need to put fares up in this way and calls on FirstGroup to withdraw these unacceptable fare increases and make further representations to the Scottish Government to increase the Bus Service Operators Grant in line with the treatment of bus operators in England and Wales rather than inflict these inflation-busting fare increases on hard-pressed commuters.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1948.2</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>First Glasgow Fare Increases</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1948) in the name of Bob Doris, leave out from &quot;fare cap has been lifted&quot; to end and insert &quot;Competition Commission has blamed the removal of its fare cap on the SNP government&rsquo;s decision not to increase the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) to compensate for rises in fuel duty; regrets the Scottish Government&rsquo;s refusal to pass on to Scottish bus operators the fuel duty rebate which the UK Government has provided for bus operators in England, thereby putting bus operators north of the border at a competitive disadvantage; further regrets that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget indicates that no further fuel duty will be rebated in the next three years; recognises that the SNP government&rsquo;s lack of support will have serious implications for bus services in Scotland, particularly for rural service operators that are already at full stretch financially; deplores the fact that bus passengers across Scotland will have to pay for the SNP Government&rsquo;s poor judgment, and calls on the Scottish government to give a detailed explanation as to why it will not increase the BSOG to compensate for rising fuel duty and what Scottish Ministers intend to do to minimise the impact on bus passengers in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1923#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>60th Anniversary of the National Health Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 60th anniversary of the National Health Service, launched on 5 July 1948 by Labour Minister for Health, Aneurin Bevan; recognises the continuing relevance of its founding principles of a socialised health service, funded through general taxation, free to all at the point of need; salutes the huge contribution of all NHS staff down the years in providing vital, lifesaving care and treatment which has improved the quality of life for millions of people, leading to dramatic improvements in life expectancy; supports the central role of the state in providing healthcare free at the point of need; encourages communities throughout Scotland to become involved in events to mark this anniversary, including those organised by NHS Greater Glasgow, the <em>Evening Times </em>and Radio Clyde, which will tell the story of the first 60 years of the NHS and serve as a powerful reminder of the unacceptable state of healthcare available to the vast majority of the population prior to 1948, and considers that all citizens, trade unions and politicians should remain true to the founding  principles of the NHS.</p>
