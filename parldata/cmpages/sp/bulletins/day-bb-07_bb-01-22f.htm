<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5441</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Budget (Scotland) (No. 4) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Budget (Scotland) (No. 4) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5440</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Harthill Medical Practice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the deep concern of patients of Harthill Medical Practice about NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s proposals to tender for a new contract to replace the current practice which is being dissolved, as expressed unanimously at a packed public meeting on the evening of Wednesday 17 January 2007, at which those present were required to select patients to sit on the panel to assess the tenders, in the following motion: &quot;That this hall is unhappy with the whole end-to-end tendering, selection and representation process and all patients here present are acting under duress as there were no alternative options&quot;, and calls for an urgent review of NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s interpretation of the law in this tendering process to determine whether or not there is a need for legal change to prevent similar action being taken by any other NHS board in Scotland in future.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5439</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Protect the Use of Xolair for Asthma Sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) not to recommend the use of Xolair for people with severe allergic asthma; notes that, for 90% of people with asthma, their asthma symptoms should be controllable if they are on the right levels of existing asthma drugs but, for those who have difficult-to-control asthma and continue to experience poor quality of life and continuous symptoms, Xolair is the only treatment that may be able to reduce the impact of asthma on their lives by reducing symptoms and hospitalisation; notes that Xolair has been shown to reduce emergency admissions to hospital, reduce asthma exacerbations, improve lung function and improve quality of life, and urges the SMC to reconsider its decision not to recommend Xolair in Scotland, a drug which has been described by Donna Covey, Chief Executive of Asthma UK, as &quot;the only hope that some people in Scotland currently have.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5438</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Glenesk: The Collected Works of John Angus, 1906-1968</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its congratulations to Niall Angus, son of late Montrose native, John Angus, on securing the publication of a collection of poems by his father in the centenary year of his father&rsquo;s birth; further notes that, while John (Jock) Angus may be best remembered for his poem &quot;Genesis&quot;, his love of his native Angus was known to many and he has been treasured and quoted by Angus folk over the years, and also congratulates all Scots who are attempting to reunite us with our language, literature and history.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5437&diams; </strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Television Coverage of Scottish Football</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should exert all its influence on BBC Scotland to ensure that the corporation provides television coverage of every Scotland national football team match; believes that, in light of the sporting and cultural importance of the national team, this issue should be highlighted every time the Executive meets BBC Scotland, and further believes that members of the public in the west of Scotland would benefit from the matches being shown on terrestrial television.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5425#</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>School Transport Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that current legislation regarding the provision of seatbelts on school transport does not require all school buses to be fitted with seatbelt facilities; further notes that the mandatory fitting of seatbelts on school buses only applies to those vehicles first used on or after 1 October 2001 or those manufactured six months before that date; recognises that this loophole can result in children&rsquo;s safety being jeopardised, as was experienced at a recent accident in Aberdeenshire, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Department for Transport in order to have legislation amended so that all school buses, regardless of age and size, are fitted with adequate seatbelt facilities.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5424</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Stick Up for the PCS Union</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 30,000 PCS members in Scotland are being balloted for strike action as part of a UK-wide ballot and that this involves staff working in devolved and non-devolved areas and the Scottish Executive; regrets that PCS has been forced to ballot for strike action because of intransigent employers and in the face of government-driven job cuts, service cuts, persistent low pay, privatisation and closures; recognises that the Executive is among the lowest paying 25% of public and private sector employers, with a starting salary of &pound;12,000 per annum; believes that the Executive has a responsibility to resolve the issues affecting its staff and ensure a negotiated settlement with the PCS, but, in the absence of such a response, sends full support and solidarity to all those members being balloted and commits to standing shoulder to shoulder with them on the picket lines.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5421</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Rename Queensberry House as Fletcher House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that there are few people celebrating the 300th anniversary of the Act of Union; recognises that the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament in 1707 was a defeat for the Scottish nation; notes that the central figure who colluded with the monarchy and the English state in the removal of power from that Parliament against the will of the people of Scotland was James Douglas, the Duke of Queensberry and original owner of the Queensberry House building in the new Holyrood complex; further notes that, in contrast, the person noted for the most honourable and progressive role in that period was Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, who fought against the union and to maintain a Scottish Parliament, and who also championed democratic reforms such as annual elections to that Parliament, only the Parliament having the power to declare war and the removal of the royal veto which, 300 years later, have still never been achieved; believes that the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament in the late 20th century testifies to the foresight of those such as Fletcher; therefore believes that it would go some way to acknowledge the wrong and injustice that was done if Queensberry House were renamed Fletcher House, and looks forward to the day when that building will reside within a Parliament with full powers in an independent Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5418</strong> <strong>John Home Robertson:</strong> <strong>Bicentenary of the Abolition of Slave Trade</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the immense human and historic significance of the abolition of the slave trade in the British empire in 1807; notes with shame the role of some Scots in the slave trade and the cruel exploitation of enslaved people from Africa before abolition; pays tribute to the memory of those Scots who campaigned for abolition, including William Dickson and Zachary Macaulay; condemns the criminal exploitation of human beings that still exists in some parts of the world, and asserts the need for vigilance by national and international agencies to safeguard the principles initiated by the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act 1807.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5414#</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Fair Parking for the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the plan to build a new hospital for sick children alongside the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh at Little France in south Edinburgh; notes that parking costs only 70p per hour and is free in the evening and at weekends near the current Royal Hospital for Sick Children site in Sciennes but that parking at the Royal Infirmary is almost &pound;1.20 per hour, up to a maximum of &pound;10 per day, and that this applies for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and believes that bus services to the Little France area should be improved from all parts of the city and that NHS Lothian should guarantee that parking at any new hospital will not cost any more than the current site and that the mistakes that were made in respect of fixing parking charges at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh are not made in planning the new sick children&rsquo;s hospital.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5413</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Electric Shock Training Collars for Dogs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the undertaking by the Scottish Executive to examine the case for banning the use of electric shock training collars for dogs; further notes that Carwyn Jones AM, Minister for Environment, Planning and Countryside in the Welsh Assembly Government, has announced his intention to seek to ban these collars in Wales, and therefore asks that the Scottish Executive reports on the progress of its consultations with animal welfare groups and others.</p>
