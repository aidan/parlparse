          <p><strong>*S2M-1185</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Renewable 
            Energy and Energy Efficiency</strong>-That the Parliament endorses 
            the Scottish Executive's targets to generate increasing amounts of 
            electricity from renewable sources; notes that Scottish ministers 
            have, in the last two years, approved 600 megawatts of wind farms 
            and 7 megawatts of hydro power schemes and that Scottish local authorities 
            in the same period have consented to approximately 170 megawatts of 
            new renewable energy capacity; acknowledges the contribution of the 
            Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative in encouraging 
            renewable energy capacity building for communities; acknowledges the 
            long-term potential for the development of renewable energy technologies 
            including the associated economic benefits and rural regeneration 
            and export opportunities; welcomes the associated drive to increase 
            energy efficiency measures across Scotland including the recent announcement 
            of the public sector energy efficiency fund and the environmental 
            best practice being promoted by the Scottish Energy Efficiency Office; 
            also recognises the contribution that both renewable energy and energy 
            efficiency make to reducing carbon emissions, and supports the Executive's 
            commitment to tackling climate change.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1184</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Mental 
            Health</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges, in National Depression 
            Week, the Scottish Executive's commitment, reflected in the Partnership 
            Agreement, to maintain the mental well-being of the people of Scotland 
            and to improve the situation of those with mental health problems; 
            notes that National Depression Week aims to raise awareness of the 
            realities of depression and to reduce the stigma associated with it; 
            commends the work of the National Programme for Improving Mental Health 
            and Well-Being and progress towards implementation of the Mental Health 
            (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003; welcomes specific initiatives 
            in relation to workforce development and service re-design, such as 
            the Doing Well by People with Depression projects, but also urges 
            the Executive to continue to support efforts to reduce suicides through 
            the &quot;Choose Life&quot; strategy, to remove stigma and to increase 
            the range and quality of services available to those with mental health 
            problems.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1183#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of Queen Mother's Hospital</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            dismay the decision by Greater Glasgow NHS Board to close the Queen 
            Mother's Hospital; further notes that the pioneering work undertaken 
            at this hospital is world-renowned; agrees with many top specialists 
            in this field that the closure of this facility will lead to the lives 
            of new-born babies from Glasgow and around Scotland being placed in 
            jeopardy; believes that it is the duty of the Minister for Health 
            and Community Care to act in the public interest at all times, and 
            considers that the best way to do this would be to reverse this devastating 
            and unwelcome decision.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1182</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> 
            <strong>Successful Completion of A1 Expressway</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the opening of the A1 expressway between Haddington and Dunbar 
            by the First Minister on 14 April 2004; welcomes the fact that this 
            new dual carriageway will improve road safety and reduce travelling 
            times for local and long-distance journeys; congratulates the staff 
            of the Scottish Executive, Balfour Beatty, Carl Bro and all the designers 
            and contractors on the quality of the new road and associated environmental 
            works, and urges the Executive to work up plans to dual the remaining 
            single carriageway sections of the A1 in Scotland and to complete 
            this essential part of the trunk road network of the United Kingdom.</P>
