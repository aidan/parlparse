<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish National Party Debate: Energy Policy&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3543</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers it unacceptable that in energy-rich Scotland fuel poverty blights our society; notes with concern that, despite Scotland possessing massive energy resources, urgent action is required to avoid an energy gap in the next decade; calls for the development of an energy policy for Scotland that will deliver security of supply, affordability, self-sufficiency and energy efficiency; recognises that the transmission charges for power generators, as permitted by the UK Government, will undermine these objectives; rejects nuclear power in favour of an energy mix that includes making Scotland the world leader in renewable energy and carbon capture and storage technology; believes that such a policy will boost our economy and meet our environmental obligations, and recognises that the Scottish Parliament requires the necessary energy powers and control over our oil and gas resources to deliver the nation&rsquo;s energy needs in the 21st century. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3543.4</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson: Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3543) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;considers&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the development of a wide range of renewable energy technologies in Scotland as a key element of a balanced energy supply mix; supports the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to achieving 40 per cent renewable electricity generation by 2020; supports the Executive&rsquo;s attempts to eradicate fuel poverty by 2016; looks forward to publication of the revised Scottish Climate Change Programme and the consideration given to the contribution of energy efficiency and renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions; recognises the Executive&rsquo;s commitment, as set out in the Partnership Agreement, not to approve the construction of any new nuclear power stations in Scotland until the issue of waste has been addressed, and supports the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to continue to work with the UK Government and energy supply industries to ensure that the immediate and future energy supply needs of Scotland are met.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-3543.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3543) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from first &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that renewable and nuclear energy are complementary and that, in order to achieve a balanced energy policy, no existing or potential resource should be ignored; urges the Scottish Executive to revisit its renewable energy policy to provide proper planning guidance to local authorities, communities and developers in relation to the siting of wind farms and, until this guidance is implemented, calls on the Executive to declare a moratorium on the determination of locally-opposed wind farm planning applications, and believes that the North Sea oil and gas industry is best served by the current regulatory arrangements.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-3543.3</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird: Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3543) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;to deliver the nation&rsquo;s&quot; to end and insert &quot;in order to deliver Scotland&rsquo;s sustainable energy needs and to tackle climate change which is recognised as one of the greatest threats to our economy, communities and environment; further considers that, if we are serious about tackling climate change, a radical overhaul of our energy use is urgently required, particularly addressing contradictory transport policies which are increasing carbon emissions, and further notes that a truly sustainable energy policy will require the widespread adoption of domestic and community-based renewable micro-generation as well as the development of decentralised energy networks.&quot; </p>
