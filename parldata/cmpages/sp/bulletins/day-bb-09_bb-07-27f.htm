<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4629 Elaine Smith: Concern at UCU Report on Education Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses alarm at figures in a report by the University and College Union that state that around 280 jobs are at risk in universities in Scotland; is concerned by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s failure to make higher education a funding priority, thus losing the momentum provided by the investment of the previous administration; notes that around 5,000 students will be affected, with losses hitting the full range of institutions; considers that this is not simply a fight for lecturers&rsquo; jobs but part of a much bigger fight for the Scottish education system and the struggle to widen access for all, particularly the most marginalised groups, and considers that the Scottish Government should now urgently invest in this sector, especially at this time when there is overwhelming evidence that adults faced with redundancy are returning to higher education to facilitate career change.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4628 Michael Matheson: Falkirk Council Backtracks over Single Status Pay Protection</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of Falkirk Council to reduce single status pay protection from four to three years; considers that some of the lowest paid employees of Falkirk Council will lose out financially because of this decision, and calls on the Labour/Conservative-led council to reinstate the position of the previous SNP-led council and offer four years&rsquo; pay protection.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4627 Claire Baker: Student Hardship Crisis in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at new statistics on the levels of student hardship at colleges and universities in Scotland; notes that the report, <em>Higher and Further Education Students&rsquo; Income, Expenditure and Debt in Scotland 2007-08, </em>finds a 60% increase in students&rsquo; reliance on credit card and bank loan borrowing among higher education students and a huge increase of 334% among college students over the last three years; further notes findings that 38% of higher education and 40% of college students have considered dropping out, with financial considerations cited as the largest reason, and that many students have gone without food, heating, books for study and prescriptions or medicines because of a shortage of money; expresses concern that this research took place before the economic downturn hit students in Scotland; believes it is further proof that increasing money in students&rsquo; pockets must at this stage take precedent over reducing graduate debt; highlights the calls from student leaders across Scotland for increased availability of student loans from the Scottish Government, and calls on the Scottish Government to use existing resources to implement the main opposition parties&rsquo; action plan to tackle student hardship by providing a &pound;500 increase in grants and a &pound;7,000 minimum income for the poorest students, a &pound;200 increase in support for all students and nearly &pound;2 million additional investment in childcare and hardship funds.</p>
<p>Supported by: Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4626 Richard Baker: Granite City Graduates Come Out on Top</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recently published findings of the Higher Education Statistics Agency detailing graduate employment rates that show that job prospects for granite city graduates are among the best in the United Kingdom; notes that graduates&rsquo; job prospects differ from university to university; agrees that Aberdeen&rsquo;s two universities are among Britain&rsquo;s best and are in Scotland&rsquo;s top three universities for progression into further study and employment, with 98% of Robert Gordon University graduates and 96.7% of University of Aberdeen graduates in employment or further study within six months of graduating in 2007-08; notes that these figures are higher than those of Oxford, Cambridge and the majority of Scottish institutions, and congratulates Aberdeen&rsquo;s two universities for delivering a world-class student experience and excellent learning environment for students, helping them to develop crucial skills that make them more employable and able to compete in an increasingly competitive job market.</p>
