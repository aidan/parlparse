    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-437</b> <strong>Angus MacKay: Tackling Drug Misuse in Scotland</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament commends the multi-agency role of the key agencies across Scotland in
    implementing <i>Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in Partnership</i>; acknowledges the
    Executive&#146;s support for the agencies involved in implementing the priorities and
    strategy, and welcomes the Executive&#146;s cross-cutting approach and the efforts being
    made to reverse the tragic level of drug deaths and drug misuse in Scotland.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-436#</b> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Compensation Claims By Former Miners</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament is concerned that there have been delays in the settlement of compensation
    claims by ex-miners in Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and in other areas of Scotland who
    are suffering emphysema, chronic bronchitis or vibration white finger as a consequence of
    their employment, that payments for settled claims and lawyers&#146; fees are to be met
    from the miners&#146; own pension funds, that many miners are being retested following
    confirmation that they are suffering from these diseases and that questions have been
    raised in former mining communities regarding the relevant experience of medically
    qualified personnel involved in the assessment of claims; welcomes the work undertaken by
    Westminster colleagues in securing the establishment of the monitoring group involving
    trade union representatives; recommends making further representations to Her
    Majesty&#146;s Government on this issue, and calls for measures to ensure that medically
    qualified staff involved in the claims process in Scotland have previous expertise in
    diagnosing emphysema, chronic bronchitis and vibration white finger.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-435#</b> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Slopping Out in Scottish Prisons</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament agrees that urgent action must be taken in the 21st century to end
    &quot;slopping out&quot; at affected Scottish prisons, particularly Barlinnie Prison,
    Glasgow which is 90% without basic sanitation; acknowledges that Barlinnie cannot start
    its third century with this stomach churning and degrading practice continuing and that
    the practice of emptying chamber pots around five times a day is not only inhumane for
    prisoners but for also for staff who supervise and who deplore the practice; notes that
    Barlinnie&#146;s high international status as an innovative prison and its excellent
    rehabilitation work is impaired seriously by the time consumed by slopping out, with
    around 400 staff hours a day wasted away from essential rehabilitation work with prisoners
    due to the security need to be on duty at sluice rooms, and urges that the money removed
    from the Scottish Prison Service budget for the Drugs Enforcement Agency must not result
    in any delay to plans to end slopping out as feared by prison officers.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-434</b> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Drugs Deaths</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament expresses its sympathies for the families of those who died in Lanarkshire over
    the Christmas period as a result of drug misuse; recognises the need for a range of
    responses to the problem of drug misuse including education programmes, harm reduction,
    rehabilitation and law enforcement, and welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s continued
    commitment to tackling this problem.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left"><a name="433"></a>*S1M-433 Mr Murray Tosh on behalf of the Procedures
    Committee: Standing Orders (Definition of Budget Bill)&#151;That the Parliament agrees
    that its standing orders be amended by substituting for paragraph 1 of rule 9.16. &#150;</p>
    </b><p ALIGN="left">&quot;1. A Budget Bill is an Executive Bill for a Budget Act within
    the meaning of Section 29(3) of the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act

    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-432#</b> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Rural Poverty</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes that a report in 1995 by Strathclyde Regional Council highlighted rural
    poverty in the Strathclyde area, particularly in Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley;
    welcomes the establishment of social inclusion partnerships to address this situation;
    believes that there is a need to adopt a Scottish wide approach when considering rural
    poverty, and calls for an enquiry into the extent and nature of rural poverty throughout
    Scotland. </p>

    &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;considers that the principles of equalising
    the age of consent for homosexual and heterosexual activity and creating a new criminal
    offence of breach of trust as set out in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill considered
    by the UK Parliament in the 1998-99 parliamentary session fall entirely within the remit
    of the Scottish Parliament and on that basis agrees that these matters be judged only
