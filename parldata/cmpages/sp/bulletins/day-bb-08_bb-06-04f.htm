<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2057</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Investment in Scottish Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of <em>Taking Forward the Scottish Futures Trust</em> and the &pound;14 billion of infrastructure investment set out in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure Investment Plan; believes that it is important to ensure maximum value for the public purse from infrastructure investment and welcomes efforts to deliver better value, and further notes that 14 possible options for work to be carried out under the umbrella of the Scottish Futures Trust were identified and will be the subject of further development before being brought back to the Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2056</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Remote and Rural Health Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the Remote and Rural Steering Group and recognises that its report, <em>Delivering for Remote and Rural Healthcare</em>, forms the basis of a safe and sustainable service for remote and rural areas that will increase community resilience and guarantee the future of Scotland&rsquo;s rural general hospitals; notes the extension of the Emergency Medical Retrieval Service pilot, providing consultant-led resuscitation and transfer of patients with life-threatening injuries or illness in remote and rural hospitals in the west of Scotland, which commenced on 2 June 2008, and further notes the work of the Remote and Rural Healthcare Education Alliance in providing a co-ordinated approach to the development of remote and rural health education programmes across Scotland to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s healthcare professionals can provide, and their patients can benefit from, the best possible healthcare, as locally as possible.</p>
<p>Supported by: Shona Robison<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2055</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Great British Weekend is Not a Great Idea</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes proposals from UK Government Immigration Minister, Liam Byrne MP, to designate the August Bank Holiday weekend as a &quot;Great British weekend&quot;; notes that the August bank holiday is observed on different days in Scotland and in England and Wales; further notes that the United Kingdom has fewer statutory public holidays than many other European countries and none at all between summer and Christmas, save for the St Andrew&rsquo;s Day bank holiday in Scotland; believes that forcing people to celebrate a weekend of &quot;Britishness&quot;, which may not be part of their identity, is not a good use of a bank holiday weekend, and further believes that the St Andrew&rsquo;s Day bank holiday already serves as a celebration of culture in Scotland and that employers across the country should respect the Parliament&rsquo;s decision to observe the day as a bank holiday.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2054</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Veterans Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament marks Veterans Day on Saturday 12 July 2008; notes that Veterans Day honours Scotland&rsquo;s veterans past and present and acknowledges their heroic service to protect Scotland; welcomes the role of Stirling as Scotland&rsquo;s focus for this year&rsquo;s annual commemorations, with highlights including a pipers&rsquo; trail procession from Stirling Castle through the city centre, a Gala Day with an RAF Tornado flypast as well as music, displays and exhibitions and the UK&rsquo;s first veterans-themed film festival; notes Stirling&rsquo;s proud military history and believes that the city will show great gratitude to the present veterans; recognises that there are currently about 500,000 veterans living in Scotland, and believes that ex-servicemen and women should be given the level of care that reflects the service and commitment that they gave to protect our country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2053</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Reporter Excludes Evidence at Substation Expansion Hearing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit to deny objectors to the expansion of the electricity substation at Wester Balblair the right to submit evidence about the damaging heath effects of electromagnetic radiation emitted from electricity substations; believes that this not only calls into question the validity of the inquiry but also undermines the Wester Balblair community which has a right to have its point of view heard; considers that dismissing the community&rsquo;s view out of hand reinforces the public scepticism about the whole project, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review the decision of the Reporter with a view to giving the community a fair hearing.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2042</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Angus Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent publication of Post Office Ltd&rsquo;s <em>Area Plan Proposal for North East, Tayside and Fife</em>; further notes with concern that there are a number of proposed post office closures in Angus, including proposed branch closures in Forfar and Southmuir, as well as reduced services in Glamis; believes that these post office branches perform an important role in the local communities that they serve; hopes that the branches will not be closed or have a reduced service as this will have a detrimental impact on the affected communities, and believes that the views of the postmasters and the communities affected by the proposed closures must be fully considered before any decisions are made on the future of the post office network in Angus.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2041</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>European Maritime Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that European Maritime Day is to be celebrated annually on 20 May, the aim being to highlight the whole web of relationships that bind together all maritime and marine-related issues and activities in Europe, in line with the joined-up and cross-cutting approach of the new Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union proposed by the Commission in October 2007; welcomes the fact that, during the consultation process on this new policy, numerous stakeholders voiced the opinion that celebrating Europe&rsquo;s maritime heritage and future as well as highlighting its maritime activities would help to raise citizens&rsquo; awareness, not only of the importance of the maritime sectors, but also of the key roles of the marine environment and Europe&rsquo;s coastal regions, islands and outermost regions; further welcomes this initiative by the European Commission which is also planning an annual Open Ports Day in the context of a maritime week that encourages all the European regions, ports, cities and other maritime stakeholders to join in the celebrations and to work together so that the European Maritime Day can serve in the future as the focal date for launching a maritime week of conferences, festivities, networking, best practice exchange and benchmarking activities throughout the EU, and hopes that the Scottish Government will engage robustly with the Conference of Peripheral and Maritime Regions with a determination to ensure that such full resolve will result in new passenger and freight ferry operators to Zeebrugge and other ports across the EU.</p>
