        <p ALIGN="left">S1M-378 Mr Jack McConnell: Draft 2000-2001 Budget - Level 2 Figures&#151;</b>That
        the Parliament commends the Executive&#146;s expenditure plans published in the
        consultation paper Spending Plans for Scotland on 17 November 1999 and endorses the
        spending priorities set out in the paper in line with the commitments of the Partnership

          Figures&#151;</b>As an amendment to motion (S1M-378) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell,
          leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the increased pressure
          being placed on the Scottish budget through the effects of the &quot;Barnett
          Squeeze&quot;, which means that spending is increased two and a half times quicker in
          England than in Scotland despite the fact that there is no evidence of a reduction in
          relative need; calls upon the Scottish Executive to prepare a detailed assessment of the
          impact of the &quot;Barnett Squeeze&quot; in consultation with the Finance Committee;
          regrets the fact that the Parliament is not responsible for raising the revenue it
          allocates, and notes that normal fiscal autonomy would secure maximum fiscal
          responsibility and accountability and would allow the Scottish Parliament to allocate the
          required resources for Scottish public services&quot;. <b><i></p>
