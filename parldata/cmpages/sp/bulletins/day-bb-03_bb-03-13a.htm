                        Kingdom forces should take part in any military action 
                        without a United Nations mandate that specifically authorises 
                        such action and is based on clear, compelling and published 
                        evidence, and believes that any pre-emptive action by 
                        the United States of America and the United Kingdom without 
                        such a mandate would be contrary to international law</p>
