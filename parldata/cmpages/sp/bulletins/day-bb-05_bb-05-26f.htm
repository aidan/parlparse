          <p><strong> * S2M-2877</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie: Environmental Injustice in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the publication of <em>Investigating environmental justice in Scotland: links between measures of environmental quality and social deprivation </em>by the Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research (SNIFFER); further notes the report&rsquo;s findings that Scotland&rsquo;s poorest communities are more likely to experience poor air quality and be living near to industrial pollution, derelict land or rivers with poor water quality and that in rural areas opencast mines and quarries are more likely to be located closer to poorer communities; believes that the report clearly demonstrates that Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived communities bear the burden of living in the worst environments and that this demonstrates the lack of progress in securing environmental justice for Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to renew its commitment to environmental justice and to explain what steps it will take to remedy the situation; considers the recent decision by ministers to approve the M74 Northern Extension to be a step in the wrong direction, and believes that the Executive should demonstrate its commitment to environmental justice by heeding calls for a planning system which is fair at all stages, including the appeal stage.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2876</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle on behalf of the Baird Trust Reorganisation Bill Committee: Baird Trust Reorganisation Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Baird Trust Reorganisation Bill and that the Bill should proceed as a Private Bill.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2875</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Bill, debate of groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time-limits indicated (each time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when the meeting of the Parliament is suspended or otherwise not in progress):</p>

          <p> Supported by: Mr Andy Kerr<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2873</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: School Pupils&rsquo; Evidence to the Public Petitions Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament thanks the pupils from St Ronan&rsquo;s Primary School, Innerleithen, and Clyde Valley High School, Wishaw, who gave evidence on separate issues to the Public Petitions Committee on Wednesday 25 May 2005 and the pupils from Bowmore Primary School, Islay, who gave a video presentation on their petition to committee members; considers that all the pupils concerned exhibited knowledge, confidence and authority in presenting their particular petitions; notes that the fact that young people feel able to interact with politicians in this way is an indicator of how accessible the Parliament and politics can be, and considers that it is essential that the Parliament works to ensure that openness and accessibility continues and develops to encourage the widest possible interaction between the Parliament and the people. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2872</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Haste Ye Back</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Rugby team on its 38 - 7 victory over the Barbarians at Pittodrie Stadium in Aberdeen; welcomes the support given by Aberdeen City Council, Scottish Enterprise Grampian and Aberdeen Football Club to make the game possible; notes that that this was the first rugby international to be held in Aberdeen for 70 years, and hopes that the win and the tremendous support will persuade Scottish Rugby to hold another international match in Aberdeen in the very near future.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2871</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner: Medical Student Debt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the ever-increasing debt levels of medical students in Scotland with an average debt of &pound;11,406 and one in five more than &pound;20,000 in debt; further notes that 59% of applicants to medicine in 2003 came from managerial and professional backgrounds and that inadequate financial support currently available to medical students may act as a significant obstacle to those from poorer backgrounds which made up only 10% of such students; notes that students from less affluent backgrounds are likely to incur far higher levels of debt because of their parents&rsquo; inability to contribute to the costs of maintenance, and believes that rising levels of debt have a serious impact on student well-being and that consideration should be given to replacing the student loan system with a grant system for all students. </p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2870</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Low Pay Continues to Blight Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the Scottish Low Pay Unit report, <em>Low Pay in Scotland</em>, which shows that there is still a chronic problem with low pay in Scotland; notes that the report says that at least 421,000 workers, over a quarter of the Scottish workforce, earn less than the low pay threshold&nbsp;which currently stands at &pound;7.44 per hour; notes that the report also shows that the gender pay gap continues, with women in Scotland earning just 63% of male gross median earnings; believes that an &pound;8 per hour minimum wage would immediately lift hundreds of thousands of Scots out of poverty; urges the Scottish Executive to direct local authorities to implement an &pound;8 an hour minimum wage, and believes that the Executive should enforce equal pay legislation in the public sector.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2869#</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Learning Disability Week, 19 to 26 June 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 28th annual Learning Disability Week which takes place from 19 to 26 June 2005; notes that this week is important in raising the profile of people with learning disabilities and family carers; further notes that the theme, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Our Community Too&rdquo;, highlights the difficulties that people with learning disabilities face in becoming involved with their local communities; celebrates the work of ENABLE and the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability in raising awareness, changing negative perceptions, encouraging participation and building respect; recognises that it is five years since the seminal policy document, <em>The same as you?</em>, was published by the Scottish Executive which aims to improve access to opportunities for people with learning disabilities; welcomes direct ministerial involvement in chairing the Implementation Group, and, while congratulating the Executive on the steps taken so far, encourages it to maintain the momentum for change in order to achieve full implementation of the recommendations.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2866.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Student and Graduate Debt</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2866) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &ldquo;further&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;calls on the Scottish Executive to end the graduate endowment which places an increased debt burden on students; recommends that the student loan repayment threshold be raised to &pound;20,000 and that the loan value be increased to &pound;5,000 per annum at a low, but commercial, rate of interest, which will remove the necessity for students to resort to expensive overdraft and credit card borrowing, and calls on the Executive to transfer all or part of the loan book to independent providers so that higher education can expand without extra and undue burden being placed on the taxpayer.&rdquo;</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2866.2</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Student and Graduate Debt</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2866) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &ldquo;notes with concern&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;agrees that the support arrangements for students ordinarily resident in Scotland should continue to be based on fairness and affordability; agrees that such a system should include free tuition, regardless of family income, and bursary support for those from less well-off backgrounds; welcomes the increased level of the Young Students&rsquo; Bursary and its extended eligibility; notes that liable graduates pay the graduate endowment in respect of the higher education benefits that they have received with the payments adding to the fund to pay support bursaries for students from poorer backgrounds, and recognises that the publication of the survey of Scottish students&rsquo; income and expenditure, later this year, will allow for a better understanding of the situation facing students and the continued development of policy to meet their needs.&rdquo;</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2861.1</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne: Age Discrimination in the NHS</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2861) in the name of Shona Robison, leave out from &ldquo;and believes&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;believes that the Health Committee should consider the issue of elderly abuse in its post-legislative scrutiny of community care legislation; further believes that any neglect of the elderly reflects the current problems and workforce pressures that the NHS suffers from, and recognises that the NHS needs real reform to alleviate these fundamental problems.&rdquo;</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2861.2</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Age Discrimination in the NHS</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2861) in the name of Shona Robison, leave out from &ldquo;is concerned&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;believes that older people deserve the best care and attention from the NHS, free from discrimination; is concerned that older people, their families and the organisations that represent them persistently report that this is not the case, and considers that urgent action needs to be taken to remove all forms of age discrimination within the NHS.&rdquo;</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2861.3</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Age Discrimination in the NHS</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2861) in the name of Shona Robison, leave out from &ldquo;is concerned&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;welcomes the work of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland on its 2004 review of older people in acute care and its recommendations on how to improve services; welcomes the independent inquiry set up by NHS Lothian in response to recent criticisms of its standards of care, and welcomes the fact that the Scottish Executive has commenced work on an overarching framework for healthcare and community care for older people in Scotland, having due regard to David Kerr&rsquo;s report on the future of the NHS.&rdquo;</p>
