          <p><strong>*S1M-2773</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Scottish Place 
            Names Survey</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the excellent 
            work undertaken by the Scottish Place Names Survey and by Ian Fraser 
            who retired in autumn 2001; notes that the discipline of toponymy 
            is of great benefit to a nation, particularly one which has three 
            indigenous languages and whose place names are influenced by no less 
            than six languages, more than in any other European country; accepts 
            that state funding for toponymy is the norm in most European countries 
            and that toponymists contribute valuable assistance to national and 
            local government and to individuals in matters such as sourcing derivations 
            of place names, suggesting appropriate names for new developments 
            and preserving our cultural and linguistic heritage; agrees with the 
            Principal of Edinburgh University that state funding could be expected 
            for the survey while regretting that continued funding by Edinburgh 
            University is no longer possible, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to provide appropriate financial assistance to the Scottish Place 
            Names Survey to allow it to proceed with the next phase of the Scottish 
            Place Names Database and offer a service to inquirers. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2772</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: GB Curling 
            Team Gold Medal at Winter Olympics</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            congratulates the five Scottish members of the Great Britain curling 
            team, Rhona Martin, Janice Rankin, Fiona MacDonald, Debbie Knox and 
            Margaret Morton, who have won the Gold Medal in the 2002 Salt Lake 
            City Winter Olympics; admires their great determination, perseverance 
            and skill in overcoming the odds and predictions of the bookies and 
            pundits and winning the first Gold medal for Britain in curling since 
            the sport became an Olympic event and the first Gold medal for Britain 
            for 18 years; welcomes the fresh interest shown in the sport, and 
            looks forward to a warm welcome for the team when it returns home 
            and increased participation in curling throughout Britain. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2771</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Congratulations 
            to Scottish Olympians</strong>&#151;That the Parliament, on behalf 
            of people in Scotland, congratulates Rhona Martin, Debbie Knox, Fiona 
            MacDonald, Janice Rankin and Margaret Morton on winning the Women&#146;s 
            Curling Gold Medal at the Winter Olympic Games; thanks them for the 
            quality and style of their ambassadorial role for curling and Scottish 
            sport and sportsmanship and for their positive promotion of Scotland, 
            and that of their team coaches, to a world-wide audience, and urges 
            electricians&#146; wives everywhere to aspire to the same level of 
            expertise and success in their chosen sport.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2770</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Women's Curling 
            Olympic Gold Medal</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            the UK Woman&#146;s curling team, their coaches and support staff 
            on their tremendous achievement in winning an Olympic Gold medal and 
            on becoming the first Scots to win Winter Olympic Gold since 1936; 
            admires their professionalism and their generous sportsmanship, and 
            expresses the hope that their example will stimulate renewed interest, 
            official backing and increased investment not just in curling but 
            in other traditional Scottish sports.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John Swinney<strong>*</strong>, Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2769</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Cancer Network 
            Fife</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates staff and management 
            of Cancer Network Fife, including the volunteers, for their work in 
            providing a flexible support, information and advice service to local 
            people in Fife affected and concerned about cancer.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Brian Monteith<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2768</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Local Income Tax</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that the Dundee Conservative Councillor, Neil 
            Powrie, an avowed Thatcherite, has slated his own party&#146;s attitude 
            to the Council Tax; further notes that he has congratulated the self-styled 
            Marxist, Tommy Sheridan of the Scottish Socialist Party, for bringing 
            forward an alternative to the Council Tax; wonders whether this is 
            a sign of the new politics that Scotland was promised following the 
            establishment of the Scottish Parliament, and pledges support for 
            the idea of a Local Income Tax based on the ability to pay. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2767</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson: Voting Rights for 
            16-Year-Olds</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that young 
            people are entitled to be treated in a fair, just and consistent manner 
            and are entitled to have the same rights as other citizens; further 
            recognises that adulthood begins at 16 and that young people work, 
            pay tax and have much to contribute to society and politics; notes 
            that the Electoral Reform Society believes that there is a strong 
            body of opinion in favour of votes for 16-year-olds; notes with concern 
            the reduced number of young people voting in elections and also notes 
            recommendation 167 of the Report of the McIntosh Commission on Local 
            Government and the Scottish Parliament, which asks for particular 
            consideration to be given to the possibility of extending the vote 
            in community council elections to 16-year-olds as a first step to 
            extending the franchise in all elections to 16-year-olds, and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's 
            Government to promote and support any appropriate amending legislation 
            so that in all future elections people will be able to vote from the 
            age of 16.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2766</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: National Park 
            Funding</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the very real 
            concerns of the Association of Community Councils of Loch Lomond and 
            the Trossachs regarding under-funding of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs 
            National Park and calls on the Scottish Executive to reconsider the 
            amount of finance being made available to ensure that the National 
            Park is provided with a sustainable level of resources, bearing in 
            mind the amount recommended by Scottish Natural Heritage of £5.6 million.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona McLeod<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2765</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Intelligent 
            Finance Jobs Boost for Fife</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
            the announcement from internet and telephone bank Intelligent Finance 
            that it is to create 600 new jobs and transfer a further 200 to a 
            new customer contact and administration centre located in Rosyth, 
            Fife.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2764</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Young People 
            at Risk</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern that 
            the Young People&#146;s Unit at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital had, 
            at 7 February 2002, 88 young people on its waiting list for only 12 
            beds, nine of which were at that time occupied, with NHS Lothian having 
            access to six beds, NHS Forth Valley having access to two beds each, 
            with two beds for Scotland-wide emergencies; notes that allocation 
            is on the basis of clinical priority which can mean that it takes 
            one or more suicide attempt to be allocated a bed; further notes that 
            it is estimated that one in five young people suffer from some form 
            of mental health problem, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive, 
            which purports to put young people at the top of its agenda, to provide 
            more resources to the NHS for mental health so that these many vulnerable 
            young people have the care they require before the situation becomes 
            a crisis.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona McLeod<strong>*</strong>, Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mr Lloyd Quinan<strong>*</strong>, Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2763#</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Asylum Centre, 
            RAF Turnhouse</strong>&#151;That the Parliament considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should give all possible assistance to Edinburgh 
            City Council in relation to the possible development of an asylum 
            seekers accommodation centre at the former RAF Turnhouse site in West 
            Edinburgh, should do all it can to encourage the Home Office to engage 
            in meaningful and timeous consultation with the council, local residents 
            and elected representatives to allow a full and proper evaluation 
            of the site and of the impact on the local community and on key council 
            services such as housing, law enforcement, education and transport 
            and should acknowledge also the present difficulties in relation to 
            available public housing stock in the City of Edinburgh, and further 
            considers that Scottish ministers should produce a national resettlement 
            framework so that resettlement of asylum seekers from any Scottish 
            centre would involve all areas of Scotland and would ensure distribution 
            across all local authority areas.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2762</strong> <strong>Fiona McLeod: GM Crop Trials</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament believes that the GM crop trials underway in Scotland 
            should be discontinued immediately and ploughed up in light of (a) 
            the report by the Royal Society on 4 February 2002, (b) the study 
            by English Nature revealing that genes from separate GM varieties 
            can accumulate in plants that grow from seed spilled at harvest through 
            a process known as "gene-stacking", (c) the recent admission by the 
            Scottish Executive that horizontal gene transfer from GM foods has 
            taken place under laboratory conditions and (d) Her Majesty's Government&#146;s 
            own scientific evidence, as detailed in the <em>Sunday Times </em>of 
            17 February 2002.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2761</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Appointment 
            of Berti Vogts as National Football Coach</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the appointment by the Scottish Football Association of Berti 
            Vogts as the new Scotland coach; recognises the experience and quality 
            that he will bring to the task, having managed his native country&#146;s 
            team to international footballing success, and extends its best wishes 
            both to Mr Vogts and to the national team for their match on 27 March 
            2002 against the World Cup holders and for a successful campaign to 
            qualify for Euro 2004 in Portugal.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2760#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Dundee City Council 
            Budget</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that Dundee City Council 
            on a motion supported by the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat 
            Councillors set a budget which includes the closure of a library and 
            a neighbourhood centre and the reduction of funding to an anti-poverty 
            information centre, all of which are located in or serve areas covered 
            by social inclusion partnerships; further notes that the SNP Group 
            presented a budget which, for a pound a year extra per Band D household, 
            would have preserved all of the services noted above and would also 
            have resulted in the delay of a steep increase in the price of school 
            meals, and concludes that the unionist parties in Dundee will go any 
            length, including attacking the very poorest in society, in order 
            to preserve power in the Council chamber.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2759</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Treatment of Heroin 
            Addiction by Diacetylmorphine Prescription</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament notes with interest the recent pilot programme for treatment 
            of heroin addiction using pure heroin in the Netherlands; is aware 
            of similar work in Switzerland and Australia, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to consider the practicalities and possible pitfalls of 
            such treatment&#146;s potential application in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2758</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: Dangerous 
            Roads in the Highlands</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the findings of the European Road Assessment Programme and 
            the Automobile Association showing that seven out of the 10 most dangerous 
            roads in Scotland are in the Highlands; believes that this is a symptom 
            of many years of serious under investment in the Highlands on road 
            maintenance and improvements, and therefore calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to work with Highland Council in order to find solutions 
            and address these problems.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2757</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Anniversary of 
            the Old Parliament of Scotland </strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the 295th<sup> </sup>anniversary of the adjournment of the former 
            Parliament of Scotland on Monday 25 March 2002; recalls the words 
            of Dr Winnie Ewing MSP at the first session of the reconvened Parliament 
            on 12 May 1999, and believes that the Parliamentary Bureau should 
            mark the anniversary of the adjournment on the nearest sitting day 
            by providing time for a debate on a motion honouring the past, present 
            and future of Scottish democracy, those who fought tirelessly for 
            the Parliament&#146;s restoration and those who still campaign for 
            the completion of its powers and for national independence.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2756#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie: Dangerous Driving 
            and the Law</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the publication 
            of the report by the Transport Research Laboratory, <em>Road Safety 
            Research Report No.26, Dangerous Driving and the Law,</em> which examines 
            the use and application of the law on careless and dangerous driving 
            throughout the UK; further notes the conclusions of the report and, 
            in particular, that (a) the situation exists where those &quot;guilty 
            of serious negligence in their driving face the same charge of Careless 
            Driving as those guilty of very minor offences&quot;, (b) maximum 
            penalties are rarely used, (c) limited resources allocated to investigating 
            fatal road traffic accidents affect the quality of the police investigations 
            of them, and (d) the level of care for victims of the bereaved is 
            variable across the UK; draws attention to the report&#146;s recommendations 
            and, in particular, the recommendations that the (i) introduction 
            of a new offence of causing death/serious injury by negligent driving 
            should be introduced and (ii) feasibility of special prosecutors should 
            be investigated; supports the report where it states that in Scotland 
            a &quot;clearer message regarding the seriousness of these offences 
            would be sent to both defendant and society if all causing death by 
            dangerous driving cases were tried in the High Court&quot;, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should commission specific Scottish research

            this is the result of the decline of heavy industry in the area over 
            the past two decades; welcomes the progress made so far and the further 
            initiatives aimed at promoting the area, such as Ambassadors for Inverclyde 
            and the Tall Ships Race, and believes that Inverclyde Council should 
            work in partnership with elected constituency representatives and 
            all key agencies in order to implement existing plans for regeneration 
            of the area.&quot;</a></p>
