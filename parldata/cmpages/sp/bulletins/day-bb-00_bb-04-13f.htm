            awarded the contract to run the voucher scheme for asylum seekers

            anxiety among the staff and the local community, and further welcomes 
            the additional capital investment of over £2 million to improve services

            Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order</i>, <i>1999 </i>(SP paper

            of consultation carried out prior to the introduction of the boundaries 
            order, that the introduction of a boundaries order appears not to 
            have identified any inconsistency with the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore 
            Activities) Order 1987, and that the amount of fishing activity in 
            the disputed area does not appear to have influenced the Order, and 
            further notes the Committee's recommendation that the Secretary of 
            State for Scotland should either introduce a new, revised Order, or 
            support a Bill calling for a revised boundary proposed in the House 
            of Commons by Archy Kirkwood MP. </font></p>
