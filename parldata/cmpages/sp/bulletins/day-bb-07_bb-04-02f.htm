<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section.</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>S2M-5802</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>Kerelaw Residential School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the ongoing situation in relation to Kerelaw Residential School in North Ayrshire; recognises the devastating effect that allegations and subsequent investigations and suspensions can have on individuals and their families; believes that a public enquiry should be held to determine exactly what happened at the school, and expresses concern over the conviction of ex-Kerelaw worker, John Muldoon.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5801</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Thanks to Parliament Staff</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to join the Scottish Socialist Party parliamentary team in conveying sincere thanks to the people in the Parliament who work to make each of our lives easier: cleaners, catering staff, porters, security staff and police, mailroom staff, maintenance staff and all parliamentary workers, who remain courteous, friendly and hard-working.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5800</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Fears Over Retention of DNA from Innocent People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the permanent retention of DNA from innocent people is something which was debated and rejected through proper parliamentary procedures and that such parliamentary decisions should be respected; expresses regret that Scottish Labour&rsquo;s election manifesto will call for this measure to be introduced even though there is no evidence that the retention of innocent people&rsquo;s DNA is effective in solving crime, and calls on the Scottish Executive to uphold the wishes of the Parliament while looking at more effective means of tackling crime.</p>
<p>Supported by: Chris Ballance, Carolyn Leckie, Eleanor Scott, Tommy Sheridan, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Ms Maureen Watt</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5799</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Monklands General Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &pound;300 million investment planned by NHS Lanarkshire; further welcomes the planned Maggie&rsquo;s Centre, cancer service and the 24-hour community casualty unit at Monklands General Hospital, however condemns the decision by NHS Lanarkshire, ratified by the Scottish Executive, to downgrade the hospital; believes that health service reconfiguration decisions should be based on the health and social needs of the people of Lanarkshire, weighted for the impact on reducing social and health inequalities, and not narrow financial considerations; further believes that the financial information provided to the NHS board as a basis for its decision was flawed; notes that Elaine Smith MSP has referred the matter of the finances to the Auditor General for Scotland and is awaiting an outcome; further notes that the decision was reached after a flawed consultation which was launched with a preferred option to downgrade Monklands and which dismissed the 50,000 signatures collected by Karen Whitefield, Cathie Craigie and Elaine Smith MSPs, ignored the articulate comments made at public meetings and did not reflect the content of the many comprehensive submissions made; finds it incredible that NHS Lanarkshire has decided to downgrade its busiest, most efficient and effective accident and emergency department, located in the area serving over half the population of Lanarkshire and suffering from some of the poorest health in Scotland alongside high levels of poverty and deprivation; notes that Wishaw and Hairmyres hospitals close to accident and emergency admissions much more frequently than Monklands; believes that a reduction in capacity by downgrading Monklands can only exacerbate that situation and increase the pressure on neighbouring hospitals, and believes that this decision to downgrade Monklands should be reversed.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5798</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with Sunvic Strikers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its support for the strikers at Sunvic Controls, 39 women and three men who between them have 1000 years&rsquo; service with the company and who are members of AMICUS and the TGWU; notes that the company wishes to change the contracts of the predominantly female group of staff so that they can be laid off without pay at the discretion of management, despite the fact that the company has publicly stated that it is in the strongest position it has been in for five years; also notes that these workers are only paid &pound;6.22 per hour, with no career progression and no wage rise for four years; further notes with extreme concern that there are two bargaining units at the plant, the predominantly female, low-paid one, which has been targeted for contractual change, and one which is for the &quot;skilled&quot; all-male group of workers, which has not been targeted; believes that the company has picked a fight with the women in a discriminatory and exploitative manner; deplores the entrenched low pay and the behaviour of the management of Sunvic; commends the solidarity, strength and determination of the strikers, and calls on management to enter into meaningful negotiations that will settle the dispute to the satisfaction of the strikers and their trade union representatives.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5797</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>Laighdykes Playing Fields, Saltcoats</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the substantial loss of public open space that has occurred as a result of North Ayrshire Council building a school on Laighdykes playing fields, the only playing fields serving the two towns of Saltcoats and Ardrossan; recognises that the actions of the Labour-controlled council in this matter were very much against the wishes of local people; further recognises that objections were not to a new school but rather to the fact that the Labour councillors chose to build it on public open space and football pitches, despite several other locations being available; commends the actions of Laighdykes Residents Group in co-ordinating opposition to the Labour councillors who implemented these plans, and wishes success at the forthcoming North Ayrshire Council Elections to Laighdykes Residents Group members, Ronnie McNichol and John Hunter, who will be contesting the elections as independent candidates and in the interests of local people.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5796</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Linda Fabiani MSP</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Linda Fabiani MSP on being awarded the Cavaliere dell&rsquo;Ordine della Stella della Solidarieta&rsquo; Italiana (Knight of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity) by Italian ambassador, Giancarlo Aragona, in recognition of her efforts to promote relations between Scotland and Italy and further notes the valuable contribution that Scots-Italians have made in all walks of Scottish life.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5795</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>St Ambrose is Top of the Class</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils, teachers and support staff of St Ambrose High School, Coatbridge, on achieving an excellent HMIE report awarding the school five &quot;excellent&quot;, nine &quot;very good&quot; and two &quot;good&quot; quality indicators, making it one of the best secondary schools in the country and only the second to achieve five &quot;excellent&quot; ratings; commends head teacher, Bernard Fagan, for his leadership and contribution to the school, and wishes him well on his forthcoming retirement.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5794</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Launch of Prostate Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the new charity, Prostate Scotland; recognises that prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men in Scotland, after lung cancer, that it is the third most common cancer cause of death in the country, that incidence rates increase with age and have risen by 9.5% in the last 10 years in Scotland, that between 1998 and 2002 10,527 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in Scotland and that between 2000 and 2004 3,913 men died of prostate cancer in Scotland; is concerned the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2016 and 2020 is predicted to rise to more than 15,000, which would mark a 50% increase over a period of 20 years; is further concerned that there is a clear lack of awareness about the function of the prostate and its importance, the problems that can arise and what can be done to diagnose and treat these conditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with organisations and charities like Prostate Scotland to change attitudes and behaviours regarding men&rsquo;s health, diet and lifestyle choices, to help challenge the lack of openness about men&rsquo;s health issues, their reluctance to seek regular health checks and the lack of understanding over the risks associated with problems of the prostate and so improve education, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5793</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow for being listed for Britain&rsquo;s biggest arts prize, the prestigious Gulbenkian Prize for Museums and Galleries; notes that the first prize of &pound;100,000 will go to the museum or gallery judged to have completed the most worthy innovation in the last year; suggests that the Kelvingrove New Century Project, whereby the building and displays were brought up to 21st century standards, the number of objects on display was increased by 50% and thousands of square metres of new display space were created, would make the Kelvingrove a worthy winner; further notes that, since reopening on 11 July 2006, there have been over two million visitors, making it one of the most popular attractions in the United Kingdom, and urges all Scots to make their preference heard by voting for this national treasure through the 24-hour museum website at http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/nwh_gfx_en/ART43489.html.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5791</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Scottish Gas Card Replacement Charge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Gas policy of charging &pound;8 for replacement gas prepayment cards; further notes that prepayment is a payment method most commonly used by people on low incomes for whom &pound;8 might cover the cost of household gas for a week; further deems this to be an unreasonable and unfair charge by Scottish Gas on vulnerable people for a basic necessity, and urges the company to reconsider this policy.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5788</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Caring for Older People in Argyll and Bute</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deeply regrets that Argyll and Bute Council continues to spend below the level of Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) on care of the elderly services; notes that the underspend has grown from the previous financial year, with &pound;6 million diverted from the home-based elderly/personal nursing care budget alone; further notes that there is currently a waiting list for care packages amounting to &pound;2 million; believes that Argyll and Bute Council is the only local authority that has seen an increase in delayed discharge cases; recognises that the Social Work Inspection Agency is currently inspecting the service at the instigation of the Scottish Executive, and calls on Argyll and Bute Council to reinstate immediately the funding required to serve the needs of older people in the area and, if they fail to do so, calls on the Executive to intervene formally to ensure that the interests of older people are properly served.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5787</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Three Cheers for Gordon Brown</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s Budget for 2007 and, in particular, the fact that he has frozen duty on Scotch whisky for the seventh year running; notes that this will help distillers, such as Chivas Regal, to invest in expanding production in Scotland for long-term growth; believes that excise duty stability is supporting industry competitiveness in the home market, and congratulates the Chancellor for consistently acting in the best interests of the Scotch whisky industry.</p>
