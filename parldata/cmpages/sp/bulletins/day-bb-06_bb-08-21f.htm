<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4719</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>The Lion of Scotland Sculpture</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the excellent work of Edinburgh-based sculptor, Ronald Rae of Cramond, highlighted in the ongoing exhibition of his work in Holyrood Park supported by the Scottish Executive New Arts Sponsorship Awards and Historic Scotland; further notes that the sculpture &quot;The Lion of Scotland&quot; has proved particularly popular with the public, and, bearing in mind that the lion is our historic national symbol, calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to investigate the possibility of the sculpture being re-sited permanently outside the Parliament building.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4718</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>150th Anniversary of the Birth of James Keir Hardie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 150th anniversary of the birth of James Keir Hardie on 15 August 1856 at Legbrannock, Lanarkshire; acknowledges his importance in the development of the Labour movement, including the strikes of the new unionism in the 1880s and the founding of the Scottish Labour Party in 1888, the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1893 and the Labour Representation Committee in 1900; commends his role as a socialist in the Westminster Parliament, first as the ILP member for West Ham South and then for Merthyr Tydfil, and as the first leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party; recognises that the causes he made his own, such as class equality, environmental protection, trade union rights, women&rsquo;s equality, production for need not profit, full employment and above all peace and disarmament, remain relevant today, and welcomes this opportunity to pay tribute to a citizen of Scotland who, in his lifetime, displayed a profound understanding of the merits of egalitarianism and internationalism.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4717</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Bill, agrees to&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(a)&#9;any increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(i) of Rule 9.12 of the&nbsp;Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders, and</p>
  <p>(b)&#9;any expenditure or increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(ii) or&nbsp;(iii) of that Rule,</p>
  <p>arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>*S2M-4716</strong> <strong>Euan Robson:</strong> <strong>Local Government Boundaries in Kelso and District</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, whilst recognising the work of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland in its report E06026 of July 2006, <em>Fourth Statutory Review of Electoral Arrangements - Scottish Borders Council Area</em>, believes that the communities of Heiton and Roxburgh should be included in the Kelso and District electoral ward because of their historic, cultural, educational, social, economic and health service ties with that town.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4715</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Graeme Obree - The Flying Scotsman</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the contribution of Graeme Obree, double world champion cyclist, to placing Scotland on the world cycling map; notes Graeme&rsquo;s courage in writing and speaking about sensitive issues of bullying and mental illness; welcomes the release of &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot;, a film based on the book by Graeme Obree; applauds the Edinburgh International Film Festival Committee&rsquo;s decision to open the 60th festival with the UK premier of the film on Monday 14 August 2006; notes that the film depicts the true-life career highlights and personal achievements of Graeme Obree who, among many other achievements, won the one-hour world cycling championship in 1993 on a bicycle which he designed and constructed himself in a bike shop in Irvine, Ayrshire; commends the sensitive way in which the director of the film, Douglas MacKinnon, portrays the personal hurdles of bullying and depression which Graeme overcame to allow him to pursue his sporting dream and believes that this will set a positive example for Scottish young people; recognises the collective efforts of EventScotland, the Scottish Executive and Scottish Screen in promoting the film; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s support of the film industry in Scotland and, in particular, the recent announcement that Scottish Screen has awarded an additional &pound;150,000 to the Edinburgh Film Festival this year, attracting a further &pound;100,000 match funding from Edinburgh City Council and the UK Film Council; believes that Graeme&rsquo;s achievements and &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot; will successfully assist in promoting Scotland abroad, and congratulates everyone involved in the project.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4714</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Pardon for Executed Soldiers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the statement by the UK Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne MP, that he intends to seek posthumous pardons for the 307 soldiers court martialled and executed for cowardice, desertion and other offences during the 1914-18 war; regrets that after 90 years few of the immediate relatives of the men executed are able to appreciate the restoration of the names and reputations of these soldiers, and trusts that colleagues in the UK Parliament will approve granting a group pardon to these victims of war.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>

<p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4709</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Airport Security</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the increased terrorist threat and subsequent need for extra security is causing strain on already-stretched police resources which, according to police chief Ian Dickinson, can only be sustained in the short term and that, if the situation continues, forces will need extra resources or be forced to give less priority to other areas of policing and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase funding to police forces which have to provide increased airport security.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, John Swinburne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4708</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Knife Crime Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament encourages all efforts to reduce knife crime; notes that educational programmes and courses on the dangers of carrying a knife have been shown to have been successful in the past, and congratulates Mr Mark Davies on using his experiences as a door supervisor and martial artist to put together a new course which educates our young people on the dangers and possible consequences of carrying a knife.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4707</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Best Wishes and Hopes for Success to Yorkhill Hospital&rsquo;s Staff Representing Scotland in the Eurospital 2006 Football Tournament in Portugal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its best wishes and hopes for the success of Yorkhill Hospital&rsquo;s staff team which will represent Scotland in the Eurospital 2006 football tournament to be held on 24, 25 and 26 August in Coimbra in Portugal; recognises that this tournament brings together teams of European hospital workers from 10 nations across the continent in friendly rivalry and promotes international understanding and solidarity among health staffs of varied cultural backgrounds; hopes for the continued success of the tournament, now in its fourteenth year, and believes that the hard work, dedication and skill of the Yorkhill staff gives them a chance of bringing the trophy back to Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4706</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Equal Access to Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that separated parents should each have an equal presumption of contact with their children, so that both parents can continue to parent their children and that children are able to benefit from being parented by both parents as well as from contact with any grandparents and extended family members able and willing to play a role in their upbringing, and urges the Scottish Executive to replace the word &quot;contact&quot; with &quot;parenting time&quot; and ensure that parenting time orders can be and are made and enforced by the courts, save where the child&rsquo;s safety would be at risk.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-4697</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Energy Saving Trust - Revocation of VAT Rebate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent decision by HM Revenue and Customs to revoke retrospectively the VAT rebate which has historically been enjoyed by the Energy Saving Trust, a government-funded non-profit organisation which promotes energy efficiency and carbon saving, with the effect that the trust must now repay approximately &pound;5 million or around *6%* of its annual budget; further notes that this decision will lead to the cancellation of energy saving programmes and the loss of jobs at the trust throughout the United Kingdom as well as in Scotland; believes that this deeply regrettable decision will undermine the excellent work undertaken by the Scottish Executive to promote energy saving and energy efficiency, and urges the Executive to give careful consideration to increasing its grant to the Energy Saving Trust to make up some or all of the shortfall for the current year.</p>
