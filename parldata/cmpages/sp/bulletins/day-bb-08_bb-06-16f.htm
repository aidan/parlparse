<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2165</strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Robert Gordon&rsquo;s Debaters Triumph in Donald Dewar Memorial Debating Tournament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Jo Farmer and Michael Sim from Robert Gordon&rsquo;s College, Aberdeen, who won the 10th National Final of The Donald Dewar Memorial Debating Tournament; notes that this year&rsquo;s tournament saw the entry of over 130 teams representing schools from across Scotland, and congratulates all the pupils who took part this year.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2164</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Irish Reject the Lisbon Treaty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the democratic will of the Irish people in rejecting the Lisbon treaty; notes that it is the only country allowing its people a vote on the matter, and regrets that the government of Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP, supported by the Liberal Democrats, denied the British people the right to vote on this important piece of legislation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2163</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Learning Disability Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Learning Disability Week from 16 to 22 June 2008; notes that the theme this year is &quot;Forgotten Citizens&quot;, which has as its aim that everyone in Scotland should know about the experiences of their fellow citizens with learning disabilities, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that there is sufficient funding available to make &quot;The Same as You&quot; a reality for people with learning disabilities and their families.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2161</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Repatriation of James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the repatriation from Denmark of the remains of James Hepburn, 1534-1578, Fourth Earl of Bothwell, husband and consort to Mary Queen of Scots, stepfather to King James VI and captain of the French King&rsquo;s bodyguard, Le Garde Ecossais, for a Christian burial at his ancestral home, Crichton Castle, near Edinburgh, as was his dying wish; notes that Bothwell died a lonely, tragic death having been held hostage in a dungeon in Dragsholm Castle chained to a pillar for the last 10 years of his life; is disturbed that Bothwell&rsquo;s mummified body was previously on view in a glass case as part of a ghoulish church display until, after protests from his descendants, it was moved to Faarvejle crypt; believes that this Scottish patriot, in his day, was regarded outside Scotland as being the only honest man among the Scottish nobility of the time; is concerned that there is growing support in France to have Bothwell honoured and his remains repatriated there and buried in Rheims Cathedral, a royal French resting place, due to his French connections, whilst his beloved native Scotland has so far made no effort to reclaim one of her last &quot;kings&quot;; understands that the Danish Embassy is willing to assist in directing an application to the competent authority, the Diocese of Roskilde, for the return of Bothwell&rsquo;s remains to Scotland, and urges the Scottish Government, in partnership with Historic Scotland, to recognise Bothwell&rsquo;s place in Scottish history and honour his dying wish.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2159</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the UK Government&rsquo;s strategy, <em>Carers at the heart of 21st century families and communities: A caring system on your side. A life of your own, </em>does nothing in the immediate term to address the issue of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, an earnings replacement benefit payable for care of at least 35 hours per week, being set at &pound;50.55, whereas 35 hours at the minimum wage for an over-22-year-old is &pound;193.20, and further notes that this is an issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2153</strong> <strong>James Kelly:</strong> <strong>Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of a recent survey carried out by the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society, in which it was highlighted that 32% of people with Parkinson&rsquo;s are not being diagnosed by specialists, that more than 3 in 10 disease sufferers have never seen a Parkinson&rsquo;s disease nurse specialist, that more than one-third of sufferers have never been referred to a physiotherapist, that more than half have never been referred to an occupational or speech and language therapist; welcomes the views of many respondents that a Parkinson&rsquo;s disease nurse specialist was found to provide a useful source of information about their condition; notes that some NHS boards continue to provide no access to nurse specialists and that the provision of specialist nurses in other areas is heavily oversubscribed, and calls on the Scottish Executive and NHS boards to examine this report in detail to ensure that Parkinson&rsquo;s disease sufferers are able to access the appropriate range of support services in every area of Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2149</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Protecting Asylum-Seeker Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the comments of Children&rsquo;s Commissioner Kathleen Marshall when she said &quot;In Scotland we&rsquo;re getting some things right &hellip; The Scottish Government has spoken out against unacceptable methods of forced removal of children and set a lead in allowing asylum seekers access to further or higher education&quot;; acknowledges her warning that much remains to be done; commits itself to continuing to work to protect the rights of asylum-seeker children, and calls on the Scottish Government to do likewise.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2148#</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Upgrading of the A92</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign to dual the A92 from Glenrothes to the Melville Lodge roundabout in north east Fife and as a priority to upgrade the Parbroath junction, which is the only major intersection between Kirkcaldy and Dundee without a roundabout; commends the efforts of local people campaigning to upgrade the section between Preston roundabout and Balfarg junction, and notes that in terms of accidents the A92 is one of the most dangerous roads in Scotland with over 600 accidents in the last five years.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2144</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Approaches to Alcohol and Drugs in Scotland: A Question of Architecture</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees with the recent report of Scotland&rsquo;s Futures Forum that social and attitudinal change as is being sought with alcohol and tobacco also has a role to play in the problem of drug use; believes that implementing the recommendation of an improved method of informing the public, especially young people, of the dangers of substance abuse would increase the ability of people in that age group to make better choices; further agrees that the drinks industry has a part to play in reducing alcohol abuse and in changing public attitudes to drinking by seeking to end irresponsible drinks promotions; commends Diageo, which has a significant presence in Clackmannanshire, for the great deal of work it has already done in that field; supports the rigorous enforcement of legislation by local licensing boards that will encourage improvements in drinking culture, paving the way for a transformation in attitudes to all form of substance abuse, and, despite not supporting all its recommendations, welcomes the report as at the very least a valid contribution to the debate on substance misuse in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2138</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Sense or Census</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the possible consequences of the 2011 Census contract being awarded to the US defence group, Lockheed Martin; notes that under the terms of the US Patriot Act which allows US law enforcement bodies to demand public information from private sector companies, detailed personal information on UK citizens could be handed over to US authorities and used for covert intelligence and surveillance work, and believes that assurances from the UK Government that provisions will be made to ensure that this does not happen, which have been dismissed by the Treasury Select Committee, could lead to many citizens boycotting the census or giving false evidence which in turn would render the census useless in terms of its objectives.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2135</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Poverty Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the failure of the UK Government&rsquo;s flagship policy of halving child poverty by 2010 and eliminating it by 2020 as figures released by the Office for National Statistics show that almost 4,000,000 children and 2,500,000 pensioners are living in poverty and that the numbers have risen for the second year in a row; notes that one of the reasons identified as being a contributory factor to the rise is the burden of council tax on pensioners which would be removed under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals to replace the council tax with a fairer form of local taxation, and believes that, given the huge scale of the problem, the inability of the UK Government to tackle this problem, and the pledge by all political parties in the Parliament to do everything that they can to end poverty, support for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policies aimed at tackling poverty should be given mature consideration, including the policy for an independent Scotland empowered to tackle these problems head on.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2105</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Post Office Closure Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its opposition to the Post Office closure programme, an irrational, haphazardly executed plan to hastily scale back the Royal Mail Group even though it provides social cohesion for many of our communities; recognises that one-third of Prime Minister Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP&rsquo;s cabinet have tried to save branches in their own constituencies, the same Labour ministers who, without foresight, voted in favour of the programme and considers this position to be hypocritical; insists that the UK Government ends this ongoing lack of direction by clarifying its long-term intentions for the postal network and allays the ongoing fear of additional closures yet to come; seeks protection for the universal service obligation, vital for Scotland&rsquo;s large number of rural communities, and a speedy update of the Code of Practice on Post Office Closures; joins the Business and Enterprise Select Committee of the UK Parliament in calling for compulsory attempts at replacing sub-postmasters who retire; joins the committee in noting the lack of co-ordination between regulators and the UK Government with respect to the social impact of withdrawing payment systems from the network; urges the Department for Work and Pensions to award the card account contract, a service of fundamental importance to the whole economy, to Post Office Ltd (POL), as any other decision could devastate the network as the service is used by more than four million customers and represents a vital foothold for sub-postmasters and believes that POL is the best and most accessible provider of this service anyway; supports the Royal Mail, as it tries to regain confidence with the business community, local councils, who are making existing offices more sustainable and attempting to put work their way, and rural churches, who have not been included in the stakeholder information network but are able to contact and represent many of the more vulnerable and excluded members of the community; opposes the relatively short duration of public consultations, effectively making it difficult for many voluntary organisations to participate meaningfully in the decision process, which also falls below the eight-week minimum specified in the UK Cabinet Office best practice guidance; rejects observed proportionality in closures, which exacerbates existing levels of disadvantage, with outreach services often open for only two hours weekly, which is unacceptable for those who, due to inclement weather conditions, may have to wait weeks for an opportunity to collect their pensions, and considers that outreach services that are unable to accept postal packets weighing more than 2kg, which is a considerable inconvenience, has a negative impact on local business and defies the universal service obligation, which extends to packages up to 20kg in weight; appreciates the role played by Postwatch in the pre-consultation stage although seeks greater openness from POL in this stage to enable greater opportunity for changes to be made later on; seeks more limited confidentiality, given the substantial public investment in the network and keen public interest in the outcome; is concerned with POL&rsquo;s execution of the closure programme, noting evidence of intimidation, claims of bad practice, and allegations from local councils that POL ignored information necessary to properly implement the access criteria and determine whether offices were Disability Discrimination compliant; regrets that POL has not been prompt nor definitive in responding to government reports and that POL did not engage properly with local MPs from the outset of the programme; questions the motives behind the closure programme when outlets could simply be developed, thereby creating a real and sustainable solution rather than closing them; further rejects recommendations by Postcomm for the partial privatisation of Royal Mail by reducing the universal service obligation and also rejects the closure of offices with an attached shop that together represent the last remaining outlet in a community, noting that several such closures have taken place; opposes the closure of financially profitable offices, which may have taken place but cannot be confirmed due to POL&rsquo;s lack of financial transparency and low public confidence; agrees with independent reviewers who state that opening up the postal market to competition has led to no significant benefit for consumers while at the same time has hurt the elderly, the infirm, and those without transport, and hopes that UK ministers will appreciate the complex nature of, and wide-ranging benefits arising from, the postal network, which seemingly, as experienced so often under Labour, have been disregarded.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2082.1</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Stamp Duty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2082) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave out from &quot;on subsequent bands&quot; and insert &quot;welcomes the Conservative&rsquo;s commitment to abolish stamp duty on homes up to &pound;250,000 which will mean that nine-out-of-10 first-time buyers pay no stamp duty.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2077</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Centenary of the Vatersay Raiders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that it is 100 years since the 10 fishermen from Barra and Mingulay, who sought to establish crofts as a way of life on Vatersay, appeared at the Court of Session in Edinburgh accused of breaching an interdict imposed upon them by the absentee landlord, Lady Gordon Cathcart; notes that their two month imprisonment caused an outcry across Scotland, leading the Government to buy Vatersay for crofting; further notes that today the descendants of the raiders still live on Vatersay with a causeway now linking them to the larger island of Barra, built in order to avoid abandonment by the population of Vatersay as befell Mingulay, and notes that it was the Labour-led Scottish Executive that led the way in introducing land reform measures to give communities such as Gigha and South Uist greater control of their land and how it is managed and giving them greater power to shape their own futures, following the example of the Assynt crofters and the people of Eigg and Knoydart.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2072</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Scottish Register of Tartans Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Scottish Register of Tartans Bill.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2028</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Creative Scotland Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Creative Scotland Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1865#</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>A Tenancy Deposit Protection Scheme for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the withholding of deposits unreasonably continues to be a problem for tenants in the private rented sector; notes that the private rented sector provides over 230,000 homes to households in Scotland, some 8% of all households, including families, students, migrant workers and young professionals; further notes that many tenants, on leaving a tenancy, rely on the return of their deposit to pay the upfront deposit and rent for their new property and that withholding a deposit unfairly can lead to hardship, debt and ultimately homelessness; highlights recent research by St Andrews University Students&rsquo; Association that found that 24% of students there have had unjustified deductions made from their deposits and 28% have faced unreasonable delays of more than 28 days in returning their deposits; acknowledges the successful introduction of the tenancy deposit protection scheme in operation in England and Wales which ensures protection for both landlords and tenants, and believes that powers already on statute in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 could be used to further a deposit protection scheme for Scotland, building on landlord registration and accreditation initiatives already in place.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1811#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Passport Office</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the plans to stop passport-processing services in Glasgow, resulting in the loss of over 100 jobs and leaving Scotland without a fully operational passport service; notes with further concern what appears to have been a deliberate run-down of the service in the lead-up to this announcement; believes that this streamlining process will see a further three or four passport offices throughout the United Kingdom affected, and further believes that concise information as to the effect of these changes should be issued immediately in order to remove the doubt and uncertainty surrounding the plans.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1776</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Creative Scotland Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Creative Scotland Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
