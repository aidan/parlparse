<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4161</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>UN Watchdog Warns of Nuclear Proliferation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern comments made by Dr Mohamed El Baradei, the outgoing director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations&rsquo; nuclear watchdog, that the number of potential nuclear weapons states could more than double in a few years; agrees with Dr El Baradei that the greatest existential threat facing the world today is the acquisition of nuclear weapons by a terrorist group, especially considering that 200 cases of illicit trafficking of nuclear material are reported to the IAEA every year; further agrees that nuclear proliferation on an unprecedented scale can only be avoided in the future if major nuclear powers fulfil their Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations and disarm as rapidly as possible, and believes that the abandonment of Trident by the UK Government would be an apposite beginning to global nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4160</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>75th Anniversary of the British Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2009 is the 75th anniversary of the British Council; recognises the impact that it has had in Scotland, including supporting over 1,000 international activities in schools, managing global study and work opportunities for around 900 home and international students each year, showcasing Scottish culture to 300,000 Indian visitors at this year&rsquo;s Scottish Pavilion of the Kolkata Book Fair and hosting the biennial Performing Arts Showcase at the Edinburgh Fringe, which wins the United Kingdom in excess of &pound;1 million of bookings and has made it possible for Scottish productions to tour the globe, and wishes the British Council well for its 75th celebration reception in the Parliament&rsquo;s Garden Lobby on the evening of Wednesday 20 May 2009 and for the years to come.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Iain Smith<strong>*</strong>, Patricia Ferguson<strong>*</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4155</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Establishment of Scottish National Lottery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament backs the establishment of a Scottish national lottery; considers that the UK Government should devolve powers to Scottish ministers to enable them to establish such a lottery so that monies raised in Scotland are spent in Scotland; condemns the decision by the UK Government to divert &pound;150 million of lottery money earmarked for good causes in Scotland to help fund the 2012 London Olympics, which has a budget that is increasingly out of control, and recognises that, without the establishment of a Scottish national lottery, voluntary sector organisations and other good causes will suffer as the Camelot National Lottery continues to drain monies towards the south east of England.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4107</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Industrial Dispute at Ayr College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the failure to achieve a negotiated settlement of the industrial action at Ayr College; notes that the college board has imposed a pay settlement without the agreement of the EIS; is further concerned about the impact of ongoing industrial action at Ayr College on students whose exams are imminent, and calls on the Scottish Government to take action to bring all parties to the table to ensure that the situation is resolved as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4106#</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Overnight Freight Trains to Longannet</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the serious problems being experienced by residents in the Riverside, Broomridge and Braehead areas of Stirling, Clackmannanshire, Kincardine and Larbert as a result of heavy coal freight trains being introduced on the railway line; understands that this is having a damaging effect on the quality of life of local residents, many of whom lived comfortably in proximity to this busy line until the introduction of the coal trains; notes that Network Rail has stated that it will examine the noise and vibration test data being made available to it by Clackmannanshire and Falkirk councils respectively; regrets that Stirling Council has so far not undertaken similar studies; welcomes the efforts by Network Rail to tackle line and signalling problems at hot spots along the line, and considers that, notwithstanding the vital importance of transporting coal to Longannet for Scotland&rsquo;s energy needs, residents in these areas would welcome a reduction in the environmental impact of these trains.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4080#</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Declining Bee Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern reports of the continuing decline in bee numbers and in the number of other key pollinators; notes the importance of bees for the production of honey and, along with other species, their vital importance in food production and in support of biodiversity; supports measures to research and understand better what may be causing the reported declines as a basis for appropriate further actions; further notes that in some areas, such as Colonsay, the varroa mite, which is known to be responsible for some of the decline in bee numbers, is not present, and considers that every effort should be made to maintain that position and sustain bee and other key pollinator numbers.</p>

<p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3930 *#*</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Proposed Multi-fuel Power Station at Hunterston</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the application by Ayrshire Power Limited to the Scottish Government for permission, under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 and deemed consent under section 57 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997, to construct a multi-fuel power station at Hunterston Port, Fairlie in North Ayrshire; further notes that it is proposed that the facility would be fuelled by coal and potentially up to 15% biomass to produce up to 1,600mw of electricity per annum and would be carbon capture ready, which means that, while the facility would be designed to incorporate carbon capture and storage, it would not be installed until the technology had been shown to be technically and commercially viable, and considers that it would be beneficial if the power station operated carbon capture and storage from the outset or was able to meet an equivalent emissions performance standard by other means.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3563#</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Strathclyde Police Prolific Offender Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Strathclyde Police on the success of the Prolific Offender Programme, aimed specifically at drug and alcohol offenders, which has resulted in a 30% reduction in offending rates, particularly regarding shop lifting, housebreaking and prostitution; welcomes the inclusion of counselling, education and housing opportunities as part of the rehabilitation process under this pioneering initiative aimed at improving community safety, and notes that since 2007 over 194 people have been involved in the initiative while 95 people remain engaged in the programme.</p>
