        <strong>Impact of the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order, 1999</strong>&#151;That the

        Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order, 1999 (SP paper 42), in particular its
        dissatisfaction and concern about the level of consultation carried out prior to the
        introduction of the boundaries order, that the introduction of a boundaries order appears
        not to have identified any inconsistency with the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities)
        Order 1987, and that the amount of fishing activity in the disputed area does not appear
        to have influenced the Order, and further notes the Committee&#146;s recommendation that
        the Secretary of State for Scotland should either introduce a new, revised Order, or
        support a Bill calling for a revised boundary proposed in the House of Commons by Archy
        Kirkwood MP.</p>

        producers who entered the scheme before July 1998 were subject to a different set of
        scheme regulations in relation to stock disposal than those who entered after that date;
        further notes that the Scottish Executive have already stated that they are not minded to
        recover double payments under agri-environmental measures, and therefore believes that
        crofters and farmers should not suffer financial disadvantage through no fault of their
        own.<i><strong> R</strong></i></p>
