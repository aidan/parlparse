<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5315</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Regulation of Local Bus Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Westminster Government is currently examining proposals to grant local authorities greater regulatory powers over local bus companies; believes that traffic congestion will continue to grow until such time as local authorities have at least the same powers as the Mayor of London to regulate timetables and fares, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward legislation to give local authorities the powers that they need to regulate public transport and ensure that services are based on need and not profit.</p>
<p>Supported by: Colin Fox<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5314</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Balloon Ban</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Shetland Islands Council on banning the release of balloons because of the severe environmental damage which they cause, particularly to marine life, but also to cattle, birds and land mammals when ingested, and calls on the Scottish Executive and the rest of Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities to work together towards an outright ban on balloon releases throughout Scotland, other than for scientific purposes.</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5307</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Support for Prescribing of Tysabri for MS Sufferers in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) that Tysabri should not be prescribed on the NHS; further notes that Scotland has the highest proportion of sufferers from multiple sclerosis in the world, that the SMC accepts that the clinical case for the use of Tysabri was sound and that the recommendation not to prescribe it on the NHS was taken on purely financial grounds, and therefore urges that this decision by the SMC be overturned and that Tysabri be made available on the NHS.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5306</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Quality of Life for MS sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has decided not to recommend the drug Tysabri as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, despite it being highly effective for certain patients, leading to a 60% to 70% reduction in relapses; notes that Tysabri is a licensed drug approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and SMC only provides advice to NHS boards and their area drug and therapeutics committees across Scotland; notes also that health professionals are expected to take due account of this recommendation when exercising their clinical judgement but that this recommendation does not, however, override the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, and calls on all NHS boards to acknowledge that clinicians must be able to prescribe this treatment where they believe there is a clinical need, regardless of SMC advice to them.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5305</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Tysabri for People with MS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium not to recommend that Tysabri be prescribed to people with multiple sclerosis (MS); notes that, for a small number of those with the most aggressive from of relapsing-remitting MS for whom existing treatments do not work, Tysabri represents the only treatment available; notes that Tysabri is prescribed in Germany, Ireland and the United States of America but not in Scotland, which has the highest rate of MS in the world, and urges NHS boards in Scotland to allow the prescribing of Tysabri which had been described by Dr Gavin Giovannoni, of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, as the most significant advance in MS treatment for nearly a decade.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5303.1</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5303) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;an outcome&quot; to end and insert &quot;urges the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to resist all attempts to reduce nephrops and cod quotas and to press for increased haddock and monkfish quotas to secure a sustainable future for our remaining fishermen and particularly for the beleaguered processing sector and for the coastal communities dependent on fish, but ultimately believes that the only solution for Scottish fishing is to bring back control and management of the industry to Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5303.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5303) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;calls for a deal that provides Scotland&rsquo;s fishing communities with a sustainable share of fishing opportunities and adequate time at sea to allow the industry&rsquo;s quota to be caught and demands that any deal to the contrary is rejected; notes with regret that the failed Common Fisheries Policy continues to deliver remote, inflexible and draconian fisheries management that results in ongoing instability and uncertainty for our catching and fish processing sectors, and believes that, since over two-thirds of UK fish landings are in Scotland, Scotland&rsquo;s fisheries minister should be designated as the official lead minister for the United Kingdom in EU negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5303.3</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5303) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;and affirms that this outcome can best be achieved by shifting to long-term ecosystem-based management plans aimed towards achieving maximum sustainable yield, by making use of bycatch quotas and more technical measures in order to reduce discards and mortality in fisheries with high bycatch levels, by making innovative use of the European Fisheries Fund to support fishermen and associated communities and by supporting bottom-up approaches including the use of regional advisory councils, and urges the Executive to ensure that Scottish fishermen&rsquo;s adaptability and sacrifices are not undermined by short-term pressures.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5290*#*</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>90th Anniversary of Passchendaele</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 31 July 2007 will mark the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele which was launched on 31 July 1917 and continued until the fall of Passchendaele village on 6 November 1917; notes that Passchendaele saw the biggest loss of life of any battle in the First World War with over half a million British, Commonwealth and German troops killed, wounded or missing; notes that the Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 is currently planning a number of events to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the battle, including unveiling a Celtic cross as a memorial to commemorate Scottish soldiers who took part in the battle; thanks all governments, organisations and individuals that have contributed towards commemorations planned and towards the memorial; welcomes the memorial as it will commemorate the Scottish regiments that played a pivotal role in the battle, which saw the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the Black Watch, the Cameronians, the Gordon Highlanders, the Highland Light Infantry, the King&rsquo;s Own Scottish Borderers, the Queen&rsquo;s Own Cameron Highlanders, the Royal Scots, the Scots Guards and the Seaforth Highlanders in combat for the United Kingdom, fighting with dignity, skill and honour in treacherous conditions, and believes that the Scottish Executive should mark the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele and contribute towards the commemorations.</p>
