<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;<br />
    <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;<br />
    <br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7568&diams; </strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Removing the Barriers to Private Sector Investment in Superfast Broadband Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the restrictions that it considers have been placed on the telecoms industry by Ofcom in relation to access to BT poles and ducts; considers these limitations to be contrary to the UK Government&rsquo;s commitment to remove barriers to private sector investment in superfast broadband infrastructure; believes that this action will make the Broadband Delivery UK superfast broadband pilot to be carried out in the Highlands and Islands more challenging for any potential competitors to BT, and believes that broadband policy would be better focused on removing barriers rather than imposing restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7567&diams; </strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Freight Facilities Grants</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the contribution of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Freight Facilities Grants (FFG) in moving freight to rail and sea, and the contribution that this makes to reducing carbon emissions and congestion; notes that 37 FFG awards totalling &pound;68.9 million have been made to projects in Scotland and understands that this reduces the need for 33,573,500 lorry miles per year; recognises that Transport Scotland is in advanced discussions with a number of bidders to the fund, including a proposal by a social enterprise in South Ayrshire for a railhead at Grangestone by Girvan; believes that a Grangestone railhead could provide great economic and environmental benefits to South Ayrshire; regrets the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals to reduce support for the freight industry from &pound;10.3 million in 2010-11 to &pound;2.9 million in 2011-12, including the closure of the FFG scheme for projects which will incur expenditure after 31 March 2011, and expresses great concern that this would put in jeopardy the work that has been done on the Grangestone railhead scheme and similar proposals across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7566</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Damages (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Damages (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7565</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Use of Glasgow City Council Resources</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at reports of improper use of Glasgow City Council resources for party political purposes; understands that this reported improper use ceased following an investigation prompted by the Scottish National Party Glasgow City Council group; believes that it is regrettable that public resources should ever have been used for party political purposes, and hopes that the review reported to have been undertaken by Glasgow City Council will ensure fair and proper use of public resources in future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7564</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft National Scenic Areas (Consequential Modifications) (Scotland) Order 2010 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7555</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Susan Philipsz</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow-born Susan Philipsz on winning the Turner Prize; recognises that this is the first time that a sound installation has been nominated for the modern art prize; further notes that Susan is only the fourth woman to win this prestigious award, and wishes her all the best for the future.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7553</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Donald Stewart MP</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2 December 2010 marked the 40th<sup> </sup>anniversary of the maiden speech in the House of Commons of the Rt Hon Donald Stewart, MP for the Western Isles from 1970 until his retirement in 1987; recognises the great affection and respect with which it believes that Donald Stewart and his wife Chrissie were held, not only in the Western Isles, but across Scotland and political boundaries, and welcomes what it considers to be Donald Stewart&rsquo;s enormous contribution to the life of the Western Isles, which continues to be appreciated to this day.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7551</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Glas-goals Spectacular Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates what it considers the spectacular success of the <em>Evening Times</em> Glas-goals campaign and its three targets of encouraging Glaswegians to walk or run a million miles, stub out a million cigarettes and shed half a million pounds in weight over the course of 2010 through a series of imaginative and highly successful events; applauds the fact that Glas-goals has smashed all three targets; praises the <em>Evening Times</em> for reporting positively over the course of the campaign on a wide range of activities throughout the city that promote healthy lifestyles and challenge the city&rsquo;s poor public health record, and views Glas-goals as the perfect springboard to begin building a lasting physical and sporting legacy in the approach to the 2014 Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7550</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong> <strong>Scotland Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of the Scotland Bill in the House of Commons on 30 November 2010; notes that it is based on the recommendations of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution, which were warmly welcomed by the Parliament on 25 June 2009; supports the general principles of the Bill, which will give the Parliament substantial new taxation, spending and other powers, strengthen its relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom and enable it to serve the people of Scotland better, and calls on the Scottish Government to respond positively and timeously to any requests for assistance or analysis from Scottish Government officials from the committee considering the Bill.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7548</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Going Snowhere</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disappointed that SNP-controlled West Dunbartonshire Council has cut its winter maintenance budget, which, it considers, has resulted in residents being stranded by the recent severe weather; notes that &pound;83,370 was cut in 2009-10 and subsequently earmarked funding of &pound;100,000 was cancelled in its October 2010 emergency budget; is of the view that many areas in West Dunbartonshire have been left untreated due to these cuts and, as a result, older and vulnerable people have been left stranded in their own homes; praises the staff who it considers have worked exceptionally hard to keep the roads and pavements clear but recognises that they have to be given adequate resources to do their jobs, and regrets that West Dunbartonshire Council has made cuts to what it considers are essential services at a time when they have millions of pounds in financial reserves.</p>
