<p><b>*S2M-3523</b> <b>Hugh Henry:</b> <b>The Draft Victim Statements (Prescribed Courts) (Scotland) Revocation Order 2005</b>&mdash;That the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the draft Victim Statements (Prescribed Courts) (Scotland) Revocation Order 2005 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson<b>*</b> </p><p><b>*S2M-3522</b> <b>Christine Grahame:</b> <b>Book of Remembrance for the Victims of the Lancastria</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Lancastria exhibition which will take place in the garden lobby of the Parliament on Thursday 10 November 2005, the eve of Armistice Day; notes that the exhibition will commemorate the worst ever maritime disaster in British history and also the worst single loss of life for British forces in the whole of World War Two when the troopship, Lancastria, was attacked by enemy aircraft on 17 June 1940 off the French coastal town of St Nazaire; notes that the 16,242 ton Clyde-built liner took just 20 minutes to sink, claiming more than 4,000 lives, twice the number of victims in the Titanic and Lusitania disasters combined, yet has remained virtually unheard-of for more than 65 years, and encourages members to sign a book of condolence which acknowledges this considerable human sacrifice at the exhibition which will later be placed in the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle.</p><p><b>*S2M-3521</b> <b>Ms Sandra White:</b> <b>Protocol Regarding Removal of Children of Asylum Seekers</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive is yet to put in place a formal written protocol to clarify the role of Scottish children&rsquo;s services in future removals of asylum seeker children, despite widespread concerns related to child welfare from a number of expert sources, including the Commissioner for Children and Young People; notes that Scottish ministers have a clear remit to intervene to ensure the welfare of the child under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, and further notes that images of children being dragged from their beds in the early hours of the morning and deported back to a country they barely know will do little for Scotland&rsquo;s wider reputation abroad and indeed appears to run contrary to the Executive&rsquo;s declared policy of trying to encourage families to stay and contribute to Scotland.</p><p><b>*S2M-3520#</b> <b>Alex Fergusson:</b> <b>A76 - The Case for Improvement</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the two recent deaths on the A76 in separate incidents north of Sanquhar and near Auldgirth; recognises that the upgrading of the A77 to motorway standard from Glasgow to Kilmarnock has brought about a steady increase in the amount of traffic using the A76; notes that there have been three deaths in five years on the same stretch north of Sanquhar which would have been upgraded by now had the Scottish Executive not shelved plans agreed in the route action plan in favour of an easier option south of Sanquhar; recognises the formation of the A76 Action Group, and considers that the Executive should identify priority stretches of the A76 for urgent upgrading on safety grounds before further lives are lost.</p><p><b>*S2M-3519</b> <b>Richard Lochhead:</b> <b>Call for Withdrawal of Motion to Remove Haddock From Sale</b>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the early day motion tabled on 1 November 2005 at Westminster by Liberal Democrat MP, Norman Baker, and supported by Dan Rogerson regarding the need for the House of Commons authorities to remove haddock from sale in food outlets; believes that such a move would be extremely damaging to an industry that has already suffered significant hardships in recent years; notes that scientific advice states that North Sea haddock stocks are robust with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea recently advising the European Union that there is a healthy stock of haddock; further notes that Liberal Democrat and Scottish fisheries minister, Ross Finnie, has condemned the proposed 40% reduction in the haddock quota for 2006, and calls on Norman Baker and Dan Rogerson to withdraw their motion and commit to supporting the Scottish fishing industry as it continues the sustainable fishing of the North Sea.

believes that this film is essential viewing for the mainstream media in Scotland, not least for the information it provides to haemophiliacs, especially since the Government has admitted that it has destroyed significant and relevant documents, and further believes that nothing less than a full independent public inquiry is necessary to get to the truth of the circumstances that have caused horrendous levels of infection from blood products in the haemophiliac population and that final settlement in relation to compensation should only be expected to occur when the full, truthful information is in the public domain.</p><p>Supported by: Brian Adam<b>*</b>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<b>*</b> </p><p><b>S2M-3517</b> <b>Michael Matheson:</b> <b>Major Award for &quot;Big in Falkirk&quot;</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk Council and partners for winning a 2005 Scottish Thistle Award for &quot;Big in Falkirk&quot;;

notes that the closure of branches will prove detrimental to economic activity and will damage the affected communities; believes that the negative impact of this decision will prove most severe in less prosperous areas, and calls on the National Australia Bank Group, even now, to reconsider its decision, especially where a closure would leave a community without any local bank.</p><p>Supported by: Pauline McNeill, Margaret Smith, Patrick Harvie<b>*</b>, Brian Adam<b>*</b>, Murray Tosh<b>*</b>, Christine May<b>*</b>, Mike Pringle<b>*</b>, Rob Gibson<b>*</b>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<b>*</b>, Dr Elaine Murray<b>*</b>, Paul Martin<b>*</b>, Jackie Baillie<b>*</b>, Mr Frank McAveety<b>*</b>, Mr Kenneth Macintosh<b>*</b>, Ms Sandra White<b>*</b>, John Farquhar Munro<b>*</b>, Mr Jamie Stone<b>*</b>, Robin Harper<b>*</b> </p><p><b>S2M-3508</b> <b>Colin Fox:</b> <b>Scotsman Journalists Sacked</b>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Scotsman newspaper group to sack seven of its journalists on its daily and Sunday titles;

believes that, while diagnosis, assessment, treatment, education and support are more important than bricks and mortar, the centre has developed something truly special which would not be easily replicated if it was broken up; notes the Save The Raeden campaign which is being run by the <i>Evening Express</i> and which has attracted huge support from the people of the north east; further believes that any moves to break up the centre into separate units would be nothing short of an act of vandalism, and considers that any replacement option should consist of a new stand-alone unit to prevent the fantastic efforts of the staff and the ethos of the centre from being irreparably damaged and potentially lost.</p><p>Supported by: Frances Curran, Rob Gibson, Eleanor Scott, Shiona Baird, Robin Harper, Mr David Davidson, Ms Sandra White, Fiona Hyslop<b>*</b> </p><p><b>S2M-3503</b> <b>Dennis Canavan:</b> <b>Breast Cancer Care&rsquo;s &quot;Same Difference&quot;

recognises that the internal structure of Ottakar&rsquo;s genuinely reflects the distinctive Scottish book market, with a Scottish range and marketing manager and two Scottish operating managers; contrasts this with the highly centralised structure and purchasing policy of HMV/Waterstones, which has led to a decrease in in-store diversity and availability of Scottish books through Waterstones; thus recognises that this takeover is potentially very damaging for the Scottish publishing industry, the Scottish printing industry and Scottish writers and will have the effect of limiting choice for the Scottish book-buying public and harming our national culture and identity, and considers that the Competition Commission should investigate this takeover on the grounds of market dominance in Scotland.</p><p>Supported by: Mike Pringle, Jim Mather, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Mr Adam Ingram, Tricia Marwick, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Alasdair Morgan, Mr Bruce McFee, Tommy Sheridan, Ms Sandra White, Robin Harper, Brian Adam, Chris Ballance, Rob Gibson, Patrick Harvie, Michael Matheson, Donald Gorrie, Shiona Baird, Dr Jean Turner, Pauline McNeill</p><p><b>S2M-3242#</b> <b>Alex Johnstone:</b> <b>Scottish Food Fortnight</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of Scottish Food Fortnight which seeks to reconnect the people of Scotland with their countryside through the continuing promotion of high quality local produce to local people;
