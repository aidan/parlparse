            Montrose and its importance for the whole north-east economy; notes 
            the recent comments by the First Minister pertaining to the Scottish 
            Executive's commitment to areas outwith Scotland's central belt, and

            urges the Scottish Executive to intervene immediately to save the 
            Baillieston Community Care Project and related services from closure 
            in November as they are unable to pay their £11,000 wage bill due 
            to insecurity of funding; believes that this is a classic case of 
            care in the community running into funding problems and that closure 
            would mean that, of the 71 clients, an estimated 20 to 30 frail clients 
            will have to be admitted to institutional full-time care at a cost 
            of £322,000 to £483,000; notes that only £51,900 is needed in immediate 
            aid with £106,000 needed in total to keep the Project going and that 
            the two superb projects they run, Bealach House Day Care, Oldwood 
            Road, Baillieston and the Dementia Home Care Project, are the principle 
            surviving services of their kind in Baillieston which has suffered 
            the closure of Easterhill Day Care Centre recently and that the future 
            for more than 70 frail clients, ranging from those with cerebral palsy 
            to autism and dementia, is at stake; further notes that people, including 
            an 87 year old caring for her sister of 100 years of age, are able 
            to remain in their own homes only because of the existence of the 
            threatened day care services and that local doctors, clergy and families 
            all appeal for the service, which was founded in 1992, to be saved 
            as a matter of the greatest urgency, and considers that emergency 
            intervention is needed, as such a closure would have a devastating 
            effect on the most vulnerable people in the East End of Glasgow.</font></p>

            foster an open society where new contributions can be made without 
            requiring endorsement by politicians or producer groups, and further
