          <p>9.30 am&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Executive Debate on Scotland&rsquo;s International Image</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1831</strong> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s International Image</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament shares the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s ambitions to build relationships across national and regional boundaries to deliver social, political, cultural and economic gain; welcomes efforts to promote Scotland&rsquo;s international image and to attract people to visit, live, work, study and do business in Scotland; acknowledges the importance of promoting Scotland&rsquo;s interests overseas; agrees that Scotland has a role in meeting the shared responsibilities of the international community, and welcomes the publication of the Executive&rsquo;s first international strategy. </p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1831.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland&rsquo;s International Image</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1831) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from &quot;shares&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Executive has so far failed to fully exploit the enormous international goodwill that exists towards Scotland; calls on the Executive to use the Parliament&rsquo;s limited powers to implement a far more ambitious, strategic and consistent external relations policy and for such a policy to include the establishment of a distinctive presence overseas to promote Scotland, given that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government will always be unable and unwilling to promote Scotland with the same degree of enthusiasm and effectiveness that we ourselves could do, and further believes that Scotland will only reap the full benefits of our distinctive international image and be able to play our full part in the world when we acquire the powers of independent statehood enjoyed by our many, internationally-successful neighbours.&quot; </p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1831.3</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Scotland&rsquo;s International Image</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1831) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from second &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that Scotland&rsquo;s historic reputation abroad was built on solid achievement, and believes that the successful promotion of Scotland depends primarily on substance rather than image.&quot; </p>
            <p>12 noon&#9;First Minister&rsquo;s Question Time&mdash;</p>
            <p><strong>1. Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> To ask the First Minister what issues will be discussed at the next meeting of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Cabinet. (S2F-1118)</p>
          <p><strong>2. David McLetchie:</strong> To ask the First Minister when he will next meet the Prime Minister and what issues will be discussed. (S2F-1115)</p>
          <p><strong>3. Robin Harper:</strong> To ask the First Minister when he will next meet the Secretary of State for Scotland and what issues he intends to discuss. (S2F-1134)</p>
          <p><strong>4. Karen Gillon:</strong> To ask the First Minister what action the Scottish Executive is taking to tackle sectarianism. (S2F-1122)</p>
          <p><strong>5. Shona Robison:</strong> To ask the First Minister whether a change of Minister for Health and Community Care will mean that there is a change of health policy. (S2F-1131)</p>
          <p><strong>6. Phil Gallie:</strong> To ask the First Minister <A NAME="QuestionText">whether there is a role for parents in accompanying and supervising school excursion groups and, if so, how important that role is.</A> (S2F-1113)</p>
