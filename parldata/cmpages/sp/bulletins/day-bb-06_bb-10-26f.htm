<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5017</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>NHS Needs More Physiotherapists</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the levels of unemployment facing physiotherapy graduates new to the profession is rising year on year; notes that, according to recent statistics from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, the vast majority of the 187 Scottish graduates since June 2006 are not employed in a physiotherapy post; further notes that as many as 28,000 NHS patients are currently waiting for a physiotherapy appointment in Scotland, and believes that an urgent review of the current structure of physiotherapy services within the NHS is required to tackle the outstanding demand for physiotherapy in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5016</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with MacKinnon of Scotland Employees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends a message of solidarity and support to striking workers at the MacKinnon of Scotland factory in Coatbridge who are now in their fifth week of industrial action; acknowledges that these low-paid workers, the majority of whom are women, are demanding only a 2.5% increase on their salaries which, in a number of instances, currently fall below the minimum wage; acknowledges that this request comes following 10 years of regular wage freezes for these workers; conveys concern that, while a rise of 2.5% has been guaranteed to 3,000 non-unionised retail employees, MacKinnon has suggested that it cannot afford a similar increase for 130 manufacturing workers in Coatbridge; expresses alarm at the behaviour demonstrated by management at Mackinnon which has refused to engage with Community union representatives and have attempted to instigate disciplinary and legal action against some employees; acknowledges that such action is entirely unacceptable;  believes that it is a source of shame for Mackinnon of Scotland that, whilst the garments that these workers make grace the wardrobes of the world&rsquo;s elite, including the European Ryder Cup Team, employees in Coatbridge are being denied the most meagre of wage rises, and urges the company to rethink its current stance and engage responsibly and positively with union representatives.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5015</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Evening Express 40,000th Issue</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>Evening Expres</em>s on reaching 40,000 issues; recognises its role as a focal point for the community; praises its contribution to Aberdeen city, including its earnest campaigning for local issues; applauds the hard work of newspaper&rsquo;s staff, whose dedication underpins the success of Aberdeen Journals Ltd, and believes that the newspaper has a valuable role to play in Aberdeen for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5014</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Kate Maclean be appointed to replace Cathie Craigie on the Procedures Committee.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5013</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani on behalf of the European and External Relations Committee:</strong> <strong>Report on an Inquiry into the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Plans for Future Structural Funds Programmes 2007-13</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the European and External Relations Committee&rsquo;s 4th Report, 2006 (Session 2): <em>Report on an Inquiry into the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s plans for future structural funds programmes 2007-13 </em>(SP Paper 611).</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5012</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Support MacKinnon Mills Strikers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its support for the members of the Community union who are entering their sixth week of industrial action at MacKinnon Mills, owned by The Edinburgh Woollen Mill, in Coatbridge; recognises that the workforce, though highly skilled, is very poorly paid with many workers earning hourly rates below the minimum wage and only supplemented by productivity-related bonuses; is appalled that due to wage freezes and inflation the workforce is now 20% worse off than 10 years ago; believes that the workers, many of whom have given decades of service, have shown commitment and loyalty, have previously gone above and beyond their duty by agreeing to little or no pay settlements in the interests of the company and are now still making only the modest demand of a 2.5% pay increase, the same as The Edinburgh Woollen Mill imposed on its retail workers; is extremely concerned that the company is refusing to talk to or negotiate with the workers, despite their modest demands and the length of the dispute; believes that this is not in the interests of these workers, the company or the industry as a whole, and calls on the company to enter into meaningful negotiations with the workforce via its trade union.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5011</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Ambitious Building Standards to Combat Fuel Poverty and Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that energy standards within the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 are currently under review; believes that ambitious energy standards have great potential to reduce both fuel poverty and greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland; welcomes the aim of reducing CO2 emissions from new buildings contained in the proposed new standards; urges Scottish ministers to set ambitious targets for insulation and CO2 reduction from buildings proportionate with achieving a 60% reduction in emissions from buildings by 2050; notes research undertaken by the Building Research Establishment which suggests that compliance with energy standards in English building regulations may be as low as 57%; believes that research into Scottish compliance levels is required urgently, and calls on Scottish ministers to ensure that compulsory random air-tightness testing is introduced in all new buildings to ensure compliance with energy efficiency standards.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5010</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Threat to the Right to Therapeutic Abortion in Nicaragua</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the threat to the right to therapeutic abortion in Nicaragua; notes that under proposed legislation the 130-year-old law protecting women&rsquo;s lives may be overturned; understands that this proposed legislation would amend Nicaragua&rsquo;s penal code, a code that provides for legal abortions where a woman&rsquo;s life or health is endangered; notes that the changes have been demanded by the Nicaraguan Catholic bishops; further notes that the Nicaraguan Society of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians has protested against the proposed changes, stating that doctors have a duty to save the lives of their patients and will be unable to do so in all cases if the legislature complies with the churches&rsquo; demand for changes in the penal code; further notes that the Nicaraguan Centre for Human Rights (CENIDH) considers that the elimination of therapeutic abortion would be a violation of the human rights of women as well as a violation of the long-standing Nicaraguan principle of the state as secular; congratulates the Autonomous Women&rsquo;s Movement which has rallied hundreds of women from civil society and human rights groups to protest in support of therapeutic abortion and notes that, in contrast to the massive march supported by the Catholic and evangelical churches and many political figures, the National Assembly refused to receive leaders of the protest; acknowledges that 98% of countries allow for abortion when a woman&rsquo;s life is in danger and that more than 60% accept it when a woman&rsquo;s health is in danger, and calls on the Scottish Executive to convey its condemnation to the Nicaraguan Government over this threat.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5009</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Dyslexia Awareness Week 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Dyslexia Awareness Week will take place between 6 and 12 November 2006 and recognises the importance of such an event in raising the profile of the persistent condition which affects the learning process in one or more of reading, spelling and writing; further notes that one person in 10, which equates to around 505,000 people in Scotland, is thought to be dyslexic to some degree and, of these, one in four could be severely dyslexic; notes that dyslexia is not something to be ashamed of and can occur at any level of intellectual ability but that with early recognition and diagnosis coupled with appropriate timely intervention people with dyslexia can have a successful education and career, and hopes that the awareness week will help better inform people about dyslexia and notify people of the help and assistance available to those who may need it.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5008.1</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Coastal and Marine National Parks</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5008) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;and, in particular, urges the Executive to carefully consider the impact of a Coastal and Marine National Park on local fishermen, the aquaculture industry and all whose livelihoods are directly dependent on the sea.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5008.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Coastal and Marine National Parks</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5008) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that coastal and marine national parks may have a role to play in the future but that at the present time there are many other more pressing priorities facing our coastal communities; further notes that, according to Scottish Environment Link, there are already over 85 Acts of Parliament that apply to Scotland&rsquo;s waters and yet a further layer of bureaucracy would not be helpful or popular and would only add to the existing complexity of marine and coastal management in Scotland; calls for a review of the governance of the marine environment before additional legislation is considered; believes that the creation of coastal and marine national parks should not be considered until other priorities are addressed and there is evidence that there is sufficient demand within local communities, and calls for the Scottish Parliament to have additional powers to help protect and promote our marine environment.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5008.3</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Coastal and Marine National Parks</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5008) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;and notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;expects the Executive to take account of all stakeholders&rsquo; views with no one sector having primacy; recognises that very many livelihoods depend on our safeguarding our coastal and marine environment; expects local management of marine resources to underpin the organisation of any future coastal and marine national park, and believes that location should not be a barrier to the siting of a marine national park.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5005.1</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Climate Change and Road Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5005) in the name of Mark Ballard, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that, along with global poverty and terrorism, climate change is one of the three greatest challenges facing mankind today and therefore supports David Cameron MP&rsquo;s call for a Climate Change Bill to be included in this year&rsquo;s Queen&rsquo;s Speech to establish year-on-year targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 60% by 2050 and to establish an independent monitor to report to the UK Parliament on Britain&rsquo;s progress in meeting those annual targets and to audit government policy to assess whether we remain on track to hit future targets; acknowledges, however, that ongoing investment in the Scottish road network remains vital for public safety, cutting congestion and to protect both small businesses and remote rural communities in particular; further acknowledges that more must be done to encourage modal shift from road to rail for both passenger and freight traffic, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that those road and rail projects of greatest importance be prioritised for investment, specifically a new Forth crossing, the refurbishment of Waverley Station, the completion of the central belt motorway network and the upgrading of many important trunk routes alongside increased efforts to move more freight from road to rail.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5005.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Climate Change and Road Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5005) in the name of Mark Ballard, leave out from &quot;within a generation&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that a range of measures are required to reduce transport emissions, including a clean transport fuels strategy and provision of sustainable alternatives to road transport, and further recognises that the energy sector accounts for the greatest proportion of emissions and that Scotland has enormous potential to develop cleaner and renewable energy to reduce our carbon footprint.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5005.3</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Climate Change and Road Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5005) in the name of Mark Ballard, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s record investment of 70% of the transport budget in public transport; notes the significant investment in Scotland&rsquo;s bus services, which rely upon a modern road infrastructure, and in the rail network, where the Executive has already opened the Larkhall to Milngavie line, all with the aim of improving the environment; further supports the Executive&rsquo;s investment to reduce road deaths and casualties, improve safety on roads outside schools, and provide attractive, integrated and affordable public transport alternatives, and welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s climate change programme and sustainable development campaign.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4999.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>Young People and Families</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4999) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from first &quot;regrets&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the most important duties of the Executive towards young people are to provide them with better opportunities for education and employment, a safe environment with affordable housing in which to live and public services which are efficient and effective, and calls for a greater focus from the Executive on delivering improvements in public services and providing opportunities for young people, families, and everyone else in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4999.2</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Young People and Families</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4999) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;that children and young people&quot; to end and insert &quot;the vital importance of all young people being able to fulfil their potential; pays tribute to the contribution young people across Scotland make to their families and communities; knows the importance of the family in providing support and guidance for young people; welcomes the fact that child poverty has been reduced by over a quarter in Scotland, that the Scottish Executive has introduced universal nursery education for all three to four-year-olds, that the Executive has seen record levels of investment in schools and teachers, that more of our young people are going on to higher and further education, that youth unemployment is at a record low and that more parents are in work and have access to support and childcare; recognises further that some parents require extra support to bring up children, that decent families and young people need to be safe and protected in their homes and communities, that young people supported by and having access to good quality youth work opportunities have an important role to play in improving their communities, and reiterates the determination of this Parliament to stand up to anti-social behaviour, to end child poverty and to provide every child and young person with the best possible start in life.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4889.1</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Stirling Livestock Market</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4889) in the name of Bruce Crawford, after second &quot;Stirling&quot; insert &quot;notes that the decision was taken by the casting vote of the planning committee&rsquo;s Labour Convener, with the voting split John Paterson (Labour), Tom Coll (Labour), Tom Hazell (Labour) and the Convener, Charles McKean (Labour), for and John Holliday (Conservative), Gerry Power (Conservative), Anne Harding (Conservative) and Scott Farmer (SNP) against&quot;.</p>
