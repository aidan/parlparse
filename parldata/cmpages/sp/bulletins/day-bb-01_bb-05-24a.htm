            Russell:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>—That the Parliament notes Labour’s failure 
            to meet its 1997 and 1999 manifesto pledges with regard to class sizes 
            in the early primary years and the failure of the Executive to meet 
            the same targets, as set in its first programme for government; further 
            notes the examples of good practice that indicate a direct correlation 
            between class sizes substantially smaller than the Executive’s target 
            and higher sustained levels of attainment; recognises also the clear 
            results from programmes of class reduction that show the particularly 
            strong effect which class sizes of 18 or less have on children suffering 
            from social exclusion, and therefore calls upon the Executive to follow 
            the SNP’s lead and work much harder to achieve real and meaningful 
            reductions in class sizes in the early primary years, setting 18 as 
            the maximum figure. </font></p>

            Act 2000 and recognises that to achieve the highest possible standard 
            for each and every pupil investment must be made across the whole 
            of a child’s education, providing a quality experience in pre-school 
            for every 3 and 4-year-old child, effective early intervention to 
            ensure a good foundation in literacy and numeracy, support for all 
            children with special educational needs, a modern, well-resourced

            educational system that can provide the right type of education for 
            every child and that such a dogmatic approach should be replaced with 
            a liberal and diverse system which provides specialisation by schools 
            and more choice for parents; further believes that class size is only 
            one aspect of educational provision which may help to improve standards 
            in Scotland’s schools, and considers that greater devolution of decision 
            making to teachers and parents should be the goal of the Scottish 
            Executive. </font></p>

            Ullrich:</strong> <strong>School Swimming Lessons</strong>—That the Parliament notes 
            the report compiled by Scottish Swimming, which highlights that almost 
            50% of local authorities in Scotland no longer provide school swimming 
            lessons; acknowledges that this coincides with the report from the 
            Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents which records an increase 
            in the number of children in Scotland who die as a result of drowning; 
            recognises that the withdrawal of local authority provided school 
            swimming lessons has a greater impact on children from less well off 
            backgrounds, and calls on the Scottish Executive to encourage local 
            authorities to ensure that every pupil has access to at least one 
            publicly funded course of swimming lessons prior to leaving primary 
            school. </font></p>
