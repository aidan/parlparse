          <p><strong>*S1M-3782</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Grampian Records 
            Liquidation</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the circumstances 
            that have led Grampian Records, Wick, to the point of liquidation; 
            further recognises the vital role the company plays in the infrastructure 
            of the Scottish music industry, and calls upon the Minister for Enterprise, 
            Transport and Lifelong Learning to expend every energy to find means 
            to save this vital element of our music industry.</p>

            Year of Mountains</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 2002 was 
            the International Year of Mountains; further notes the high ecological 
            value and great socio-economic importance of mountains for Scotland; 
            welcomes the figure that 90% of visitors associate "beautiful scenery" 
            with Scotland prior to their visit; notes the estimate that visits 
            to the countryside for walking are worth £438 million to the Scottish 
            economy; further notes the essential health benefits associated with 
            walking anywhere, particularly in the hills, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to continue to protect and promote Scotland's mountains 
            as essential natural heritage, a source of wealth for the economy 
            and a destination with significant health benefits for visitors.</p>

            Water Supplies</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continued presence 
            of lead pipes in both parts of the Scottish Water infrastructure and 
            many domestic and business water supplies; notes the serious health 
            hazards associated with lead in drinking water; notes the implications 
            for the treatment of water supplies by Scottish Water and the unreliable 
            nature of information as to the location of such lead pipes, and considers 
            that an urgent review of the issue is needed and that action should 
            be taken to ensure the removal of all lead pipes from drinking water 
            supplies in Scotland as soon as possible and, specifically, to tackle 
            the removal of lead pipes in Glasgow's older tenement areas.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3773</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Drug Rape</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates Strathclyde Police on responding to increasing 
            public concern over date rape drugs and taking the matter seriously 
            and welcomes the force's "Drug Rape - Watch What you Drink" campaign 
            over the festive season, which calls on the public to take extra care, 
            particularly in relation to alcohol which is involved in over 50% 
            of date rape drugging cases.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Scott Barrie</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3766#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: British Cattle Movement 
            Service</strong>-That the Parliament notes the widespread concern 
            amongst the Scottish farming community in relation to the operation 
            of the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) and, in particular, 
            the volume of administrative errors and the delays by the BCMS in 
            dealing with correspondence; further notes that, as a result, the 
            operation of the service has contributed to financial hardship in 
            the farming sector at a time when farming incomes are already at desperately 
            low levels, and considers that the Scottish Executive's Environment 
            and Rural Affairs Department should institute an amnesty for all farmers 
            that have been alleged by the BCMS not to have accurately and timeously 
            supplied cattle record information and make representations to the 
            Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that a thorough 
            review of the operation of the BCMS should be instituted with a view 
            to eradicating the difficulties that have been identified.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3765#</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Removal of Thimerosal 
            in Vaccines</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that thirteen 
            vaccines currently available in the United Kingdom, including four 
            that are administered to children, contain thimerosal, a compound 
            50% comprised of ethyl mercury and already banned in the United States 
            of America; further notes the fears of a link between thimerosal and 
            conditions such as autism and Alzheimer's disease, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should take steps to eradicate thimerosal from 
            vaccines available in Scotland and, in the meantime, inform the public 
            about the availability of vaccines that do not contain thimerosal.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Alex Neil</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3764</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: Learndirect 
            Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes with pleasure the successful 
            growth in the number of learndirect Scotland centres in 2002, from 
            235 to 390 of which 185 are in socially excluded areas; congratulates 
            learndirect Scotland and its many partners on developing this valuable 
            new infrastructure that represents a major contribution to social 
            inclusion through widening access to learning skills and employability; 
            congratulates, in particular, Fife College of Further and Higher Education 
            on its exemplary commitment to extending access to learning, and notes 
            that the college is opening its eighth centre this month, making this 
            the largest number of centres to be established by any one organisation 
            in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3762#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: New Investment 
            for Dumbiedykes</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the withdrawal 
            of Old Town and Hillcrest, the preferred housing associations, from 
            the proposed housing stock transfer of Dumbiedykes in Edinburgh; notes 
            the lack of investment in upgrading the housing stock in the area 
            in the last six years; welcomes the development of key community facilities 
            such as the IT learning centre, the community food co-operative, the 
            Crags Sports Centre and the new Braidwood Community and Youth Centre; 
            believes that there is a need for urgent action from the City of Edinburgh 
            Council and the Scottish Executive to identify and deliver a new investment 
            strategy for housing and improvements to the area in partnership with 
            local residents, and considers that the Executive should urgently 
            review the procedures and timescales for stock transfer in the light 
            of the Dumbiedykes experience.</p>

            recognises the potential job benefits to be gained from a Scottish 
            manufacturing support base for renewable energy; further recognises 
            the crucial importance of communities benefiting from wind farms and 
            other renewable energy developments in their areas;<font color="#808000"> 
            </font>notes the growing<font color="#0000ff"> </font>number of wind 
            farm planning applications across rural Scotland; notes with concern 
            the hostile reception such applications have received from members 
            of the local community, who perceive no benefit to the community; 
            further notes that benefits can be delivered through community ownership, 
            rental income, reduced electricity bills or other methods, and considers 
            that the Executive should ensure that the Scottish economy and affected 
            communities benefit from the expansion of renewable energy.</p>
