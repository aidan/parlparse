          <p><strong>S2M-526</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Building 
            Better Cities - Delivering Growth and Opportunities</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the significant progress made by local authorities 
            and their community planning partners in taking forward the recommendations 
            set out in <em>Building Better Cities: Delivering Growth and Opportunities</em> 
            since its publication in January 2003 and the collaborative process 
            led by the community planning partnerships in each city region to 
            develop a 10-year City-Vision; welcomes the strategic plans set out 
            in the six City-Visions, including the projects to be funded by the 
            Cities Growth Fund, and endorses the Scottish Executive's long-term 
            commitment to the regeneration of Scotland's cities. </P>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-526.2</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Building Better 
            Cities - Delivering Growth and Opportunities</strong>-As an amendment 
            to motion (S2M-526) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;notes the concerns of many that the publication 
            of the <em>Review of Scotland's Cities</em> was a modest response 
            to the challenges facing Scottish cities and that the review neglects 
            the opportunity to address properly important issues of transport 
            infrastructure and finance.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-526.4</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Building Better 
            Cities - Delivering Growth and Opportunities</strong>-As an amendment 
            to motion (S2M-526) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;believes that the cities of Aberdeen, Dundee, 
            Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling are vital drivers of economic 
            growth in Scotland and that they, together with Scotland's urban and 
            rural economies, would benefit from a reduction in non-domestic rates, 
            an improvement in transport infrastructure and better public services 
            and further believes these three policies would achieve far more than 
            centrally-directed government-inspired initiatives, strategic plans 
            and visions.&quot; </P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-526.3</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard: Building Better 
            Cities - Delivering Growth and Opportunities</strong>-As an amendment 
            to motion (S2M-526) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;since&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;; welcomes the bringing together of a wider 
            range of policy strands; believes, however, that sustainability must 
            lie at the heart of urban policy rather then being an afterthought 
            to economic growth, and urges the Scottish Executive to take forward 
            a policy of urban regeneration that is led primarily by the needs 
            of local communities, rather than by big business.&quot; </P>
