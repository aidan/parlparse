                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5527</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Isle of Eigg, Winner of the Big Green Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Isle of Eigg community on being named a winner of the Big Green Challenge and awarded &pound;300,000 from the &pound;1 million prize fund that encourages community-led carbon emission reductions; notes that the Isle of Eigg team slashed CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by an impressive 32% in the last year alone, making a significant impact on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s 2020 emissions reduction target of 34%; further notes that the Isle of Eigg project fought off competition from over 350 community groups across the UK as a result of its achievements over the course of a year in four areas: CO<sub>2</sub> reductions achieved, the innovative nature of its initiatives, the longevity and scalability of the project and the level of community engagement, and commends the ambitions of the Eigg community to go even further and use the prize money to fulfil its ambitions to reduce Eigg&rsquo;s carbon footprint to ensure a low-carbon future for the island.</p>
                                        <p> <strong>*S3M-5526</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Closure of the Queen Mother&rsquo;s Maternity Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the closure of the Queen Mother&rsquo;s Maternity Hospital in Glasgow; commemorates its work over the years; recognises the pioneering ultrasound techniques developed at the facility that brought the hospital world-wide recognition; notes the view of Professor Andrew Calder who called for the name to be retained at the new site and for it to be named the Queen Mother&rsquo;s Maternity Unit of the Southern General Hospital, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to consider this proposal.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5525</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>The Illegality of the Invasion of Iraq and the Detention of Anthony Charles Lynton Blair</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the finding of an independent Dutch commission that UN Security Council Resolution 1441 &quot;cannot reasonably be interpreted as authorising individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council&rsquo;s resolutions, without authorization from the Security Council&quot;; notes that data gathered by Opinion Research Business indicated that, in September 2007, approximately one million Iraqi citizens had died as a result of the invasion of that country; further notes that, according to media reports, Hans Blix considers that the invasion was illegal and believes that the former UK Prime Minister and former US President misled the public; acknowledges that, according to the High Court of Justiciary in <em>Lord Advocate&rsquo;s Reference No.1 of 2000,</em> &quot;a rule of customary international law is a rule of Scots law&quot; and considers that, this being the case, the appropriate Scottish law enforcement agencies have the power to investigate the conclusions of the Dutch commission and the role of the former UK Prime Minister, Anthony Charles Lynton Blair, in waging a war of aggression, and looks forward to his detention and indictment.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5524</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Reversal of Ministry of Defence Decision to Sell Kentigern House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Ministry of Defence to abandon its plans to sell off Kentigern House in Glasgow for &pound;47.7 million and lease the building back on a 20-year contract at an annual rental of almost &pound;3.6 million; congratulates the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) and the Ministry of Defence civil servants and Hewlett Packard staff working at the site on their successful campaign to reverse the decision, and considers that the sale-and-leaseback proposal would have been gravely shortsighted, at a cost of &pound;150 million to the taxpayer in the long run, and that common sense has prevailed over such myopic decision making.</p>

                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5520</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Dutch Inquiry Finds Iraq War Was Illegal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of the Dutch Committee of Inquiry on Iraq, which,, at the request of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands investigated the political support given by the Netherlands for the invasion of Iraq in the period from the summer of 2002 to the summer of 2003; notes the committee&rsquo;s conclusion that &quot;the military action had no sound mandate under international law&quot;, and believes that this finding gives further weight to the argument that the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was illegal, that such findings should be taken into account by the Chilcot Iraq Inquiry currently under way in London, and that those responsible for such illegal actions should be held to account under the terms of international law.</p>
                                        <p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn<strong>*</strong>, Shirley-Anne Somerville<strong>*</strong>, Christopher Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Anne McLaughlin<strong>*</strong>, Joe FitzPatrick<strong>*</strong>, Angela Constance<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong></p>

                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5518</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Threat to Aberdeen Plastic Surgery and Burns Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the plans of NHS Grampian to downgrade and downsize the Aberdeen Plastic Surgery and Burns Unit, the unit that looked after many of the survivors of the Piper Alpha disaster; further notes that the plans are proceeding in the face of grave reservations from the unit&rsquo;s consultants; recognises the important work carried out by the unit, which undertakes complex reconstruction of cancer cases, trauma cases and burns as well as work in areas such as hand surgery, breast reconstruction and head and neck surgery; believes that the unit, which serves the needs of over half a million people from the Northern Isles to Aberdeen, cannot continue to offer the full range of services if its beds are reduced by 40% as currently planned; considers that the contraction of the plastic surgery provision in Aberdeen, while it is expanded in the central belt, would lead to unacceptable inequalities of service levels across Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government and NHS Grampian to work constructively with the consultants and staff in the unit to revise the plans to allow the unit to maintain and build on the work that it currently carries out.</p>

                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5515.1</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Attendance Allowance for People with Disabilities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5515) in the name of Alex Neil, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the opportunity afforded by the UK Government&rsquo;s Green Paper, <em>Shaping the Future of Care Together</em>, to contribute to the debate on issues concerning the future provision of care services; welcomes moves to address the postcode lottery of care and recognises the need for a similar debate to take place in Scotland, taking into account specific challenges and opportunities arising from a growing population of older people; notes that the consultation on the Green Paper closed in November 2009, and looks forward to ongoing dialogue with the UK Government to achieve shared objectives of ensuring that older and disabled people have fair access to good quality services and support.&quot;</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5513#</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Local Newspapers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the contribution made by local papers in Renfrewshire and throughout Scotland; believes that local daily papers such as the <em>Paisley Daily Express</em>, weekly papers such as the<em> Gazette</em> and free papers such as the <em>Extra</em> all add to healthy local discussion; is concerned that the removal of local authority and Scottish Government advertising will weaken the financial viability of local newspapers; notes that many people, particularly older people and those on a low income, do not have access to the internet; believes that public agency advertising in local newspapers is important for a healthy democracy, and *would welcome a review of* the decision to end advertising public notices in local newspapers.</p>
