          <p align="CENTER"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
          <p>9.30 am&#9;Debate on the Abolition of Council Tax- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2631</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Abolition 
            of Council Tax</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the council 
            tax is a fundamentally unfair and regressive tax; believes in social 
            justice and the redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor; 
            therefore agrees to abolish the council tax and replace it with the 
            Scottish Service Tax which is based on an individual's income and 
            is inherently fairer, more efficient and redistributive; notes that 
            the Scottish Service Tax would raise more revenue than the council 
            tax and that it would remove the burden of paying for local government 
            jobs and services from the shoulders of low paid workers and pensioners 
            and place it firmly on the shoulders of the well paid and the wealthy, 
            and believes that the introduction of the Scottish Service Tax should 
            be complemented by the return of the right for local authorities to 
            raise and retain their business rates and a thorough investigation 
            of land value and speculation taxes to supplement local authority 
            revenue. </p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2631.2</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock: Abolition of Council 
            Tax</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2631) in the name of Tommy 
            Sheridan, leave out from first &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;welcomes the substantial reforms that the Scottish Executive 
            has brought to the operation of local government finance, including 
            the stability for three year council tax figures and welcomes the 
            Executive's commitment to pursue further reforms; further welcomes 
            the fact that councils are now collecting a higher proportion of council 
            tax than ever before and the continuing work by the Executive and 
            local authorities to better target and further improve collection 
            arrangements, and notes that the Local Government Committee of the 
            Parliament will shortly conclude its inquiry into local government 
            finance and local taxation.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2631.1</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Abolition of 
            Council Tax</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2631) in the name 
            of Tommy Sheridan, leave out from second &quot;believes&quot; to end 
            and insert &quot;notes that it is part of an unsustainable system 
            of local government finance which, under Labour's stewardship, has 
            resulted in an increase of £103 to the average householder's yearly 
            tax bill while local services have deteriorated, and calls for a full 
            review of local government finance which includes the replacement 
            of unfair property based taxation with a system of local income tax, 
            which takes account of ability to pay.&quot; </p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Debate on the Introduction of Progressive 
            Water Tax- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2632</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Introduction 
            of Progressive Water Tax</strong>-That the Parliament believes that 
            water and sewerage services are essential services which should be 
            publicly owned and democratically controlled for the benefit of all 
            Scotland's citizens; further believes that water and sewerage service 
            charges to domestic customers should be paid for by using an income-based 
            personal tax which would be progressive, efficient and easily understood; 
            therefore endorses the replacement of the current unfair water rate 
            system for domestic customers with a new individual income-based water 
            tax that would be fair and redistributive, while raising more revenue 
            for Scotland's water and sewerage services, and notes that this new 
            Water Tax would be collected by the Inland Revenue in Scotland on 
            behalf of the Scottish water industry. </p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2632.1</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Introduction of 
            Progressive Water Tax</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2632) 
            in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave out from first &quot;believes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;commends the efforts of the Scottish Executive 
            in ensuring that the public water industry in Scotland is strong and 
            efficient, bringing considerable benefits to all customers; recognises 
            the Executive's continuing commitment to a public water industry; 
            recognises that the best way to fund the Scottish water industry is 
            through charges on domestic and non-domestic customers utilising the 
            services provided; recognises that the current system for charging 
            domestic customers already provides a degree of protection for lower 
            income households and the most vulnerable through the link to council 
            tax banding, and finally recognises that the reduction scheme provides 
            help to those low income households facing the biggest charge increases.&quot; 
          </p>
          <p>The Clerk has been advised of the topic of the following Scottish 
            Socialist Party business.</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Debate on Faslane and the Anti-Nuclear Campaign- 
          </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2633</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Faslane 
            and the Anti-Nuclear Campaign</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            that nuclear weapons pose a very real threat to humanity and accordingly 
            should be opposed on moral, social, political and economic grounds; 
            opposes the possession of nuclear weapons; supports unilateral disarmament 
            in Scotland and across the UK in pursuit of a non-nuclear world, free 
            of the threat of destruction by nuclear weapons; further supports 
            the Scottish CND and Trident Ploughshares blockade of Faslane nuclear 
            submarine base on 11-13 February 2002, and upholds the right of demonstrators 
            to protest peacefully in support of world peace. </p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2633.1</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson: Faslane and 
            the Anti-Nuclear Campaign</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2633) 
            in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;supports the right of demonstrators to protest 
            peacefully in support of world peace, but condemns those in a democratic 
            society who abuse this right and act in contravention of the criminal 
            law.&quot; </p>
          <p>11.00 am&#9;Debate on Environmentally Sustainable Employment and 
            Recycling- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2635</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Environmentally 
            Sustainable Employment and Recycling</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the significant potential to create sustainable employment 
            that will benefit both the economy and local and global environments; 
            further recognises the potential of such employment to reduce the 
            impact of climate change and toxic pollution of air, land, rivers 
            and seas, protect and enhance biodiversity, reduce social exclusion 
            and make better use of natural resources; in particular recognises 
            the potential for new jobs in the sectors of renewable energy, energy 
            efficiency, public transport, organic food and farming, nature conservation, 
            eco-tourism, education and outdoor pursuits and materials re-use and 
            recycling, and calls on the Scottish Executive to stimulate environmentally 
            sustainable employment as a matter of priority, including by (a) ensuring 
            that at least 30% of electricity comes from renewable energy sources 
            by 2010 with further increases to 2050, (b) achieving between a 40% 
            and 60% increase in energy efficiency across domestic and industrial 
            sectors, including the introduction of enhanced building standards 
            regulations for insulation, heat recovery and passive heating and 
            ventilation, (c) developing a strategic plan for organic agriculture 
            that would support conversion of up to 20% of land to organic production 
            within 10 years, (d) setting targets for traffic reduction to further 
            encourage a modal shift from private to public transport and to redress 
            the present imbalance between road and rail funding, (e) setting a 
            mandatory national target for recycling of 30% of household waste 
            by 2010 and further, independent targets for recycling of fridges, 
            re-use of white goods and recycling or safe disposal of batteries 
            and other hazardous household waste and (f) producing, in order to 
            achieve the mandatory national target for recycling, a National Re-use 
            and Recycling Action Plan to include (i) additional support for community 
            recycling, (ii) clarification of objectives for the waste industry 
            including a presumption against incineration and waste-to-energy plants 
            in new guidelines, (iii) a commitment to set an example in all areas 
            of sourcing, consumption, re-use and recycling, (iv) new guidance 
            to developers of composting operations including on methane reduction

          <p><strong>S1M-2635.3</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald: Environmentally 
            Sustainable Employment and Recycling</strong>-As an amendment to motion

            to end and insert &quot;to note that the creation of employment opportunities
