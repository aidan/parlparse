          <p><strong>*S2M-65</strong> <strong>Frances Curran: Reduction in Services 
            at Vale of Leven Hospital</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            the reduction in elderly care and mental health services at the Vale 
            of Leven Hospital; further notes the downgrading of the accident and 
            emergency services and the transfer of the maternity unit to Paisley's 
            Royal Alexandra Hospital; is aware that Vale of Leven Hospital provides 
            healthcare to a large and varied patient area, from Dumbarton to Oban, 
            covering large rural and urban areas and that this reduction in services 
            is of huge concern to people living in the area, and believes that 
            there should be a halt to any further reduction or transfer of services 
            and a re-instatement of those services already affected.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-64</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon: Register of Pensioners&#146; 
            Groups</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the work undertaken 
            by pensioners to create local elderly forums as a means of increasing 
            their democratic participation; recognises that this work is inhibited 
            by the inadequate and sparse detail currently held on pensioners&#146; 
            groups in Scotland, and encourages the Scottish Executive to give 
            further consideration to the establishment of a standard local authority 
            register of pensioners groups in order to facilitate a crucial basis 
            of communication with such groups and promote empowerment through 
            easy access to information, which will allow pensioners&#146; issues 
            to be pursued on a much broader basis.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-63#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Social Inclusion 
            Partnerships</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that the 
            current system of social inclusion partnerships has been the subject 
            of much criticism and controversy, including allegations of fraud 
            and cronyism, and has failed in its objective of reducing poverty; 
            notes that a report for the Scottish Executive by Cambridge Economic 
            Associates Ltd highlights serious weaknesses in the operation of social 
            inclusion partnerships, and therefore considers that the Executive 
            should urgently review its anti-poverty and social inclusion strategies 
            and take immediate steps to replace social inclusion partnerships 
            with a system that is open, transparent and publicly accountable and 
            that will focus resources directly to local communities in order that 
            poverty is effectively tackled.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-62</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: Stereotyping of Young 
            People</strong>&#151;That the Parliament rejects the use of the word 
            &quot;ned&quot; in relation to young people as a degrading and hurtful 
            term; is aware that ned means &quot;non-educated delinquent&quot; 
            and is therefore very inappropriate language which should always be 
            avoided particularly by elected representatives, and further notes 
            that negative language of this sort, were it used in relation to any 
            other section of society, would be considered an &quot;ism&quot; and 
            would be condemned.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-61</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: The Food Protection 
            (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) 
            (Scotland) Order 2003 and the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) 
            (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 
            2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that the Food Protection 
            (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) 
            (Scotland) Order 2003 (SSI 2003/244) and the Food Protection (Emergency 
            Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) 
            Order 2003 (SSI 2003/245) be approved.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-60#</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird: Future of the Scottish 
            Agricultural College</strong>&#151;That the Parliament questions the 
            decision of the Scottish Agricultural College to consolidate its main 
            education and research facilities at King&#146;s Buildings and the 
            Bush Estate and notes that the decision is based on an appraisal carried 
            out by Deloitte and Touche, which failed to appreciate the organic 
            research facility available at Craibstone, including the knowledge 
            gained over the last decade by the establishment of a working organic 
            farm and which failed to recognise the vital strategic importance 
            of this facility in addressing the needs of the future of organic 
            farming in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-59#</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson: Concorde 
            and the Museum of Flight</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            British Airways will be withdrawing Concorde aircraft from service 
            and welcomes the approach from the Chairman of the Trustees of the 
            National Museums of Scotland to the Chief Executive of British Airways 
            requesting that one of these aeroplanes is donated to the Museum of 
            Flight at East Fortune; recognises the interests of education and 
            tourism and the important role that museums play in both of these 
            areas; takes into account the associations of Concorde with Scotland, 
            namely that the design of the wings was undertaken by a Scot from 
            Penicuik, Sir James Arnot Hamilton, that the early test flights were 
            carried out at Prestwick in the early 1970s and that it was Concorde 
            that flew over Edinburgh to celebrate the opening of the Scottish 
            Parliament in July 1999; further recognises the wealth of experience 
            of staff at the Museum of Flight in the preservation of aircraft and 
            their years of experience in welcoming visitors to the museum; further 
            notes that staff at the Museum of Flight are confident that the practicalities 
            of landing a Concorde aircraft and of providing enclosed space for 
            display have been investigated and that no difficulties are anticipated 
            following a brief period of minor works; notes that the National Museums 
            of Scotland has recently appointed a new General Manager at the Museum 
            of Flight and that a major programme of development is planned to 
            position the museum as a world class attraction, and recommends strongly 
            that support be given to the National Museums of Scotland in its bid 
            for Concorde for display at the Museum of Flight. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, Mr Brian 
            Monteith<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-58</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: Affirmations by 
            Members</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes that the Procedures 
            Committee should review the appropriate sections of the Scotland Act 
            1998 relating to the procedure by which MSPs affirm their commitment 
            to carrying out duties incumbent on elected members and recommends 
            that such affirmations should be made in private.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-57</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: Appointment of Ministers</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament believes that the requirements of sections 44 and 47 
            of the Scotland Act 1998 are inconsistent with the duty of the First 
            Minister elected by Parliament to carry out his programme for government 
            along with ministers selected by him to have responsibility for specific 
            portfolios within that programme for government and believes that 
            the Procedures Committee should, as a matter of urgency, review the 
            proceedings surrounding the First Minister&#146;s appointment of his 
            ministerial team in order to petition Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            for appropriate amendments to the act on the appointment of ministers.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-56#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Location of Scottish 
            Water Customer Management Centre</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            expresses its concern about the plans by Scottish Water to locate 
            the new customer management centre in Glasgow or Edinburgh with the 
            resulting loss of 75 civil service jobs in Dundee; believes that there 
            should be a full economic impact assessment that takes account of 
            the impact of this move on the local economy in Dundee before the 
            proposal is approved by the Scottish Executive; questions whether 
            the proposal is consistent with the previously stated aim of dispersing 
            civil service jobs, and considers that the Parliament should ensure 
            that any decision on the siting of the customer management centre 
            is subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-55</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: The "Miss X" 
            Case and the Failings of Scottish Borders Council</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the findings in the report of 8 
            October 2002 by David Stallard for Scottish Borders Council into the 
            council's handling of the &quot;Miss X &quot;case which found, <em>inter 
            alia</em>, the lack of a clear plan for the social work role, no recent 
            recorded assessment of the needs of Miss X, an inadequate supervision 
            of Miss X and Mr B for the crucial period of 3 September 2001 to 21 
            January 2002, that the vulnerable adult protection procedures should 
            have been used on 24 or 25 January 2002, that there was no adequate 
            written guidance for lifelong care staff on guardianship and, crucially, 
            that workloads were very high for social workers, senior social workers 
            and the locality manager involved; is concerned that, following this, 
            the report of 25 April 2003 by Miss Anne Black for the council, although 
            finding failings of staff at a number of levels, did not recommend 
            disciplinary hearings despite the fact that Miss X&#146;s vulnerability 
            had been reported and had not been acted upon causing her to endure 
            brutal and heinous assaults, and believes that individual responsibility 
            for failing Miss X should not hide behind systems that fail and that 
            those responsible for the failed management systems should be held 
            to account.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-54</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Scotland's Customs 
            Dogs</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern that the 
            customs dogs trained to detect smuggled drugs, money and tobacco are 
            based in Hull and Manchester; further notes with concern that Scotland's 
            ports and airports have only had the services of these dogs for less 
            than 30 days since April 2002; believes that such front-line resources 
            are key to assisting our hard-pressed customs officials in the war 
            against drugs and organised crime, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to press by any means necessary for the repatriation of control of 
            this service to the Parliament.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-51</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Fat Cat Salaries</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament expresses its disgust at the obscene average level 
            of fat cat salaries revealed in the <em>Independent</em> on 20 May 
            2003 and calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government to introduce a maximum 
            wage as well as a minimum wage in order to curb these excessive packages.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Frances Curran, Donald Gorrie</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-50</strong> <strong>Mrs Margaret Smith: Men's Health 
            Week, Scotland: 9-16 June 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament pledges 
            support for Men's Health Week, Scotland, from 9 to 16 June 2003; acknowledges 
            efforts by all sectors to publicise Men's Health Week, Scotland; recognises 
            that most diseases affecting men are preventable and that, as the 
            population of Scotland declines and ages, the burden of treating and 
            caring for increasing numbers of men living longer with chronic disease 
            will be resource intensive; is aware that, by 2050, 60% of adults 
            will be over 65 and that men visit their GPs less than half as often 
            as women and are less likely to have chronic diseases identified and 
            treated early, and calls upon MSPs to assist on-going collaborations 
            by promoting positive messages about healthy ageing, men's health 
            and Men's Health Week, encouraging more men to take responsibility 
            for their own health and well-being.</p>

            Appeal</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the 
            Books for Baghdad appeal, a campaign to restock Iraq&#146;s libraries; 
            congratulates the University of Edinburgh and the <em>Sunday Herald</em> 
            on taking this initiative; recognises that English-language textbooks

            growing campaign against the testing of depleted uranium weapons at 
            Dundrennan in south west Scotland; recognises that there is increasing 
            evidence that these weapons are highly toxic for both the people on 
            whom they are used and the people who use them and for the communities 
            near where they are tested, and calls for full support for the demonstration 
            against depleted uranium weapons at Dundrennan on 29 May 2003.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-47#</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank: The Need for 
            a New Secondary School in North-East Fife at the Tay Bridgehead</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the longstanding need for a new secondary school 
            at the Tay Bridgehead in north-east Fife; is aware of widespread local 
            community support in the area for such a school; believes that the 
            school is vital to relieve pressure on Madras College, St Andrews, 
            which is the second largest secondary school in Scotland with a pupil 
            roll of 1,850 and on Bell Baxter High School, Cupar; further notes 
            that the relocation of an additional squadron to RAF Leuchars will 
            increase the pressure on the existing secondary schools and exacerbate 
            the current situation, and, given the seriousness of the matter and 
            the fact that little or no progress has been made on it over the last 
            two decades, considers that the Scottish Executive should intervene

          <p> <strong>S2M-46#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Appeals Against 
            Convictions for Serious Crime</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is 
            greatly concerned that the period of time permitted to lodge an appeal 
            against conviction for a serious crime can be incrementally extended 
            over an undefined period; believes that this subjects the victims 
            of these crimes to protracted suffering, and believes that the appeal 
            system should be reviewed.</p>

            the Parliament congratulates the nursery nurses who displayed solidarity 
            on the first day of their industrial action; regrets that the nurses 
            have had to resort to such action, and considers that their grading 
            claim should be settled immediately and their professional status 
            recognised.</p>

            for a dental outreach centre outlined by the new Scottish Executive 
            in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em>; recognises that there 
            are huge challenges in addressing the shortage of NHS dental services 
            in Grampian; further welcomes the fact that all 10 postgraduate training 
            places in local dental practices have now been filled, and welcomes 
            consultation on the further development of dental training in Aberdeen.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-42#</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell: Mid Scotland and 
            Fife Rail Routes</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish 
            Executive's commitment to reopening the Stirling to Alloa to Kincardine 
            rail route but considers that the reopening of the routes to St Andrews 
            and Leven is also a priority in this session of the Parliament, along 
            with station reopenings at Blackford, Greenloaning, Wormit, Newburgh

          <p> <strong>S2M-41</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Chernobyl Children 
            Life Line</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the invaluable 
            work of Chernobyl Children Life Line, formed to help the children 
            of Belarus after the Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster of April 
            1986 when 70% of the fall-out from the station landed in Belarus; 
            notes that the aim of the charity, through Britain-wide links, the 
            first being formed in 1992, is to bring children from Belarus in small 
            groups and with an interpreter to the United Kingdom for one month 
            to live with host families and that, simply by having this one month 
            away, their immune systems are boosted extending their period of good 
            health; further notes that this year 10 children will be in Scotland 
            from 18 June to 16 July with 12 host families from Haddington, Romanno 
            Bridge, West Linton and Penicuik, as well as Linlithgow, Bonnyrigg, 
            Pencaitland, Kirkliston and Edinburgh; wishes the host families and 
            the children a happy experience, and commends the work of this charity

            up to the voluntary supermarket code of conduct in the United Kingdom 
            and considers that Lidl should discontinue actions that drive down

          <p> <strong>S2M-39</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: Advertising in Schools</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament expresses deep concern at the increasing trend for 
            private companies to advertise their brands in schools, hoping for 
            a captive target market of young people who will stay true to their 
            products in later life, often to the detriment of the young people&#146;s 
            nutritional health; believes that Scotland&#146;s schools should be 
            brand-free zones and should not have to rely on the franchises, vouchers 
            or other marketing deals offered by such companies to provide computers 
            or other teaching materials, and calls on the Scottish Executive to 
            engage with local authorities across Scotland to ensure that all advertising 
            and branding is removed from schools and to provide local authorities 
            with sufficient funds to cover all the educational and nutritional 
            needs of Scotland&#146;s schoolchildren.</p>

            the Parliament notes with concern the dramatic increases in Scottish 
            Water charges to small businesses in the current financial year, which 
            in some cases amount to nearly 500% over the amount charged last year; 
            believes that these increased charges bear no relation to the services 
            provided by Scottish Water to small businesses; is concerned that 
            these dramatic increases represent an unfair burden on many small 
            businesses throughout Scotland and in some cases may threaten their 
            future viability, and further believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should direct Scottish Water to review urgently its charging structure 
            with a view to reducing the costs to business.</p>

            Scotch whisky as an option and notes that by doing so cost advantages

            the Parliament condemns the abhorrent treatment of Reza Garikani who 
            is currently detained at Dungavel House immigration removal centre; 
            notes that Mr Garikani was denied private access to his legal representative 
            by Premier Security and, whilst a patient in Hairmyres Hospital, remained 
            handcuffed and chained despite being ill; believes that this is a 
            breach of Mr Garikani's human rights; seeks a full inquiry into the 
            conduct of Premier Security, and agrees that steps should be taken 
            to ensure that such conduct never happens again.</p>

            the UEFA Champions League Cup; notes that three of the four competing 
            semi-finalists in the competition share their playing grounds with 
            other clubs; further notes that under current Scottish Premier League 
            (SPL) rules these clubs would not, like Falkirk Football Club, be 
            allowed to play in Scotland's premier league because of the ground 
            sharing rules, and calls on the SPL to review its rules and admit 
            Falkirk Football Club to the premier league with effect from next 
            season as its winning of the Scottish Football League First Division 
            title merits.</p>

            in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from "and calls" to end 
            and insert "further notes that Midlothian Council only awards annual 
            funding when, for the purposes of forward planning, it is essential 
            that funding is secured on a triennial basis; is aware that the funding 
            comes from the council, the NHS and from grant-making bodies including 
            the Community Fund and the Lloyds TSB Foundation; is concerned that 
            the Lloyds TSB Foundation funding expires in September 2003, thereby 
            reducing financial support by £40,000 and that, if this is not replaced, 
            then the service provided at the centre may have to be reduced from 
            provision for 94 frail elderly people to 40 and staffing cuts will 
            be made; believes that it is essential that day centres such as Broomhill 
            are 100% funded by a partnership of the local authorities and NHS 
            boards which is where Broomhill receives 100% of its referrals from, 
            and further believes that, without these changes, Broomhill, an award-winning

            teaching and research services from Auchincruive, Ayrshire and Craibstone,

            is approved by the Scottish Executive; questions the methodology used

            there should be a halt to the movement of staff from the SAC campuses 
            in Ayrshire and Aberdeen to Edinburgh, which runs contrary to the 
            Scottish Executive's policy of dispersing agency and department jobs
