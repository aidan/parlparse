<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3342</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Scottish Rugby Showcased at Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) on its recent event at the Scottish Parliament on 14 January 2009 to highlight its extensive work and success both on and off the field; was pleased to welcome the Scottish national team head coach, Frank Hadden, Scottish internationals, Ally Hogg and Thom Evans, and other senior SRU officials to the Parliament; welcomes figures released by the SRU showing a 21% increase in the number of people playing rugby and in particular a 24% increase in the number of young people of both sexes participating in rugby; also welcomes the SRU&rsquo;s efforts to work together with interested stakeholders in our communities to widen access to rugby for all; supports the SRU and the Scotland national team in their forthcoming Six Nations campaign set to kick-off at Murrayfield on 8 February 2009 against Wales; wishes them the best of luck in what is set to be an exciting Six Nations given the team&rsquo;s recent form, and acknowledges the economic benefits that Six Nations games at Murrayfield bring to Edinburgh and the wider Scottish economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3341</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Barnardo&rsquo;s Charity Shop in Gorgie Road</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the branch of Barnardo&rsquo;s in Gorgie Road for winning the competition among the 59 Barnardo&rsquo;s shops in Scotland to raise the most funds from recycling mobile phones; notes that it raised &pound;800; highlights that Barnardo&rsquo;s receives &pound;3 for every mobile phone and 50p for every ink cartridge that it receives, and encourages people to recycle their old mobile phones and ink cartridges in this way to help the charity continue its valuable contribution in helping disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3340</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Get in the Spirit - Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival on its 10th birthday during Scotland&rsquo;s Year of Homecoming 2009, the year of the 250th birthday of Robert Burns; acknowledges that, since its inception, the festival has developed close links with many Speyside businesses and communities as it works to provide an ever-improving range of events, facilities and services for local people and an increasing flow of international visitors; further applauds the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival for playing an important part in helping people to acquire a deeper knowledge and appreciation of their dram and in introducing whisky to new audiences, including a growing and discerning female market, and finally, as a taster for the event, notes that the preliminary round of the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Awards is taking place in the Parliament on 29 January 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3339</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Stop SNP/Lib Dem School Budget Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the level of concern expressed by parents, teachers and children about the SNP/Lib Dem run City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s proposal to impose a further 2% cut in school budgets; believes that this will strain an already diminished budget resulting in cuts to the number of frontline staff and resources, such as books, computers, stationary and support services; questions why the SNP/Lib Dem council consistently chooses to cut the services of the youngest, oldest and most vulnerable people in Edinburgh; notes that the Labour group in the council fully costed an alternative budget proposal that would reinstate the 1.5% cut from last year&rsquo;s budget, reject a further 2% cut and increase the schools&rsquo; budget for the financial year 2009-10, and strongly urges the SNP/Lib Dem councillors to drop their proposal for a 2% cut at decision time on 12 February 2009 and vote through Labour&rsquo;s proposal that aims to restore pride in our education system and allow teachers to teach and children to learn.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3338</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Airdrie Citizens Advice Bureau Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the committee, volunteers and staff of Airdrie Citizens Advice Bureau, which has recently been awarded the Scottish Standards Accreditation certificate by the Scottish Government for excellence in delivering advice in three areas, housing, money and welfare benefits; acknowledges the value of its free, independent and high-standard services at a time when applications for help from members of the public are increasing substantially because of the economic slump; notes the statistics from the Airdrie bureau that indicate that debt-related inquiries have increased by 50% since last winter and those related to redundancy have increased by 1,200%, and acknowledges the important and unique role of citizens advice bureaux in offering information and advice services, run and provided mainly by local volunteers, to communities throughout Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3335</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Enhancements to the A77 - Provision of a Bypass for Maybole</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that proposals for a bypass for Maybole in South Ayrshire were considered as part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Strategic Transport Projects Review and that at page A132 of <em>Strategic Transport Projects Review Report 3: Generation, Sifting and Appraisal of Interventions</em> it is considered that the provision of a bypass for Maybole would &quot;reduce the conflict between long distance and local traffic with a focus on identified key constraint points&quot;; further notes that, despite this assessment, a bypass for Maybole has not been included on the list of identified projects to be taken forward under the Strategic Transport Projects Review; considers that an enormous amount of preparation work has been undertaken over many years in anticipation of approval of a bypass for Maybole, including the publication of full technical reports and a costed preferred route; considers that the construction of such a bypass would bring significant benefits to the economy of South Ayrshire as a whole, and believes that a bypass for Maybole must be included as part of the proposed enhancement of the A77 south of Ayr referred to in <em>Strategic Transport Projects Review Report 4: Summary Report</em>.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3334</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Cockburns&rsquo; Haggis in Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the serving of Cockburns&rsquo; haggis at the Parliamentary Burns Club supper on 28 January 2009; notes that this is the second year that Cockburns&rsquo; haggis, the world&rsquo;s first champion haggis, was served at the event; further notes the recent success of Cockburns of Dingwall, which won the Haggis Taste-off in a blind tasting competition in Fortrose that included haggis from throughout the country, and encourages all Scottish haggis makers to have their products featured in events that appear on the Parliament&rsquo;s events calendar.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3333&diams;</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Congratulating Project Linus UK</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that Project Linus is a 100% volunteer non-profit organisation that aims to provide a sense of security and comfort to children who are seriously ill, traumatised or otherwise in need through gifts of new, homemade, washable blankets and quilts created by volunteer blanket makers; congratulates Project Linus on producing 75,000 quilts and blankets in the United Kingdom since April 2000 and specifically commends the Lanarkshire branch, which delivered 748 quilts and blankets in 2008 and has delivered a total of 2,508 since the creation of the group in 2004, and considers involvement with the organisation either by making quilts or donating materials and supplies to be extremely worthwhile and worthy of encouragement.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3332</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Robert Burns and the Edinburgh International Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the reports that the Edinburgh International Festival programme for 2009 contains no reference to the life, work or influence of Robert Burns and considers it a matter of great regret that a Scottish poet whose works have influenced people the world over and are especially relevant today should be so ignored by Scotland and the world&rsquo;s leading arts festival in this, the 250th anniversary year of his birth.</p>
