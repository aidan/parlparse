          <p><strong>*S1M-2668</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant: Campbeltown - Ballycastle 
            Ferry</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the 
            Scottish Executive of the call for tenders for the Campbeltown - Ballycastle 
            ferry; recognises that this announcement is the product of joint working 
            between the Scottish Executive, the Northern Ireland Executive and 
            the Scotland Office, and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that 
            the tendering process is concluded as soon as is practically possible 
            to ensure that the Campbeltown area can benefit from a ferry link 
            with Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2667</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Freedom of 
            Information (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Justice 1 Committee 
            considers the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 in 
            the following order: sections 1 to 3, schedule 1, sections 4 to 8, 
            sections 10 and 11, sections 14 to 42, schedule 2, sections 43 to 
            54, schedule 3, sections 55 to 61, section 9, sections 12 and 13, 
            sections 62 to 73.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2666</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Innovative 
            Philosophy Classes at Sunnyside Primary School, Alloa</strong>-That 
            the Parliament warmly congratulates the headteacher, Paul Cleghorn, 
            and the teaching staff at Sunnyside Primary School, Alloa, Clackmannanshire, 
            for being the first school in the country to introduce an innovative 
            programme of philosophy classes aimed at developing pupils' thinking 
            and questioning skills.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2665</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: New Hospitals</strong>-That 
            the Parliament, whilst welcoming the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, 
            notes that it will cost £184 million to build and will cost taxpayers 
            some £1 billion to rent over its lifetime; agrees with the report 
            by NHS consultant Dr Matthew Dunnigan, <em>The Downsized Hypothesis: 
            Value for Money</em>, that the outdated analysis of patients' needs 
            in the Lothian area used to determine the hospital's size has resulted 
            in an underestimate of the number of acute beds required; regrets 
            that the Scottish Executive has adopted the policy of previous Conservative 
            Governments in Westminster which enriched the private sector and impoverished 
            the NHS, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to review its 
            opposition to establishing a Scottish trust for public investment 
            to fund future projects similar to the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2664</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: UK Life League</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns unreservedly the tactics employed by the UK 
            Life League, particularly in terms of the horrific practice of using 
            photos of aborted foetuses and the personal tragedy of individuals 
            in the public eye, for extremely dubious political ends; regrets that 
            any group can deliberately misuse such material, particularly with 
            the specific intention of inducing fear, misinformation and confusion 
            amongst women; notes that the UK Life League website is a haven for 
            such propaganda, which is almost entirely based on falsehood and lies, 
            including the appropriation of other groups' logos and misrepresentation 
            of them to imply their support for the &quot;values&quot; of the UK 
            Life League, and reaffirms its commitment to freedom of speech for 
            all pressure groups, including legitimate pro-life organisations, 
            while remaining absolutely committed to the principle that it is a 
            woman's right to choose.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2663</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Mike Tyson</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes and applauds the decision of the Nevada Athletic 
            Commission in the United States of America not to approve an application 
            from Mike Tyson for a licence to box in Las Vegas; expresses its concern 
            at speculation that the fight might be re-arranged to a UK venue; 
            recollects the anger that was caused by the Home Secretary's decision 
            to allow Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist, to enter the UK for a fight 
            in Glasgow on 24 June 2000; further notes that Mike Tyson has at no 
            time expressed public remorse for the crimes of violence for which 
            he has been convicted; expresses the hope that boxing promoters and 
            venue managers will resist suggestions that a second Tyson fight be 
            held in Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make a 
            firm commitment that it will oppose the licensing of any boxing match 
            involving Mike Tyson in Scotland and that it will make representations 
            to oppose any visa application that might be made.</p>
