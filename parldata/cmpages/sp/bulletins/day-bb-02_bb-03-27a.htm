              the Parliament welcomes the progress that has been made by the Scottish 
              Executive in implementing A New Strategy for Scottish Tourism since 
              its publication in 2000 and commends the Tourism Framework for Action 
              2002-05 as the way to build on this and achieve a tourism industry 
              that is internationally competitive and creates jobs and wealth 
              for the people of Scotland. </p>

              <p><strong>S1M-2941.2</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Tourism</strong>&#151;As

                leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes 
                the damage caused to the tourism industry by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth 
                disease and the events of 11 September 2001; further notes that 
                the underlying problems of the high pound and high fuel costs 
                remain; notes with concern that the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
                Tourism Framework for Action 2002-05 contains no additional funding; 
                calls on the Executive to promote marketing and accessibility 
                for the sector, and further calls for action to open new air routes 
                to Scotland and to make VisitScotland, not the British Tourist 
                Authority, responsible for marketing Scotland abroad.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S1M-2941.1</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson: Tourism</strong>&#151;As 
                an amendment to motion (S1M-2941) in the name of Mike Watson, 
                leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises 
                the distinct lack of performance by the Scottish Executive in 
                assisting the tourism industry to be internationally competitive 
                and create more jobs; considers that, after five months of consultation, 
                the Tourism Framework for Action 2002-05 spells out the obvious 
                and provides no real vision for focusing on the real challenges 
                faced by the different regions in Scotland in order to promote 
                tourism opportunities through a targeted marketing approach, and 
                believes that it is entirely unacceptable that the only role the 
                Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport will play is to head a 
                Steering Group while the Executive takes responsibility for a 
                mere 10% of the actions outlined in the framework without allowing 
                business input into the strategy behind the action plan. </p>

              Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s consultation paper on the size 
              of the Scottish Parliament; acknowledges the positive progress made

                  public disillusionment with the performance of the Parliament 
                  to date; believes that reducing the number of MSPs to 108 in

                  step towards establishing public confidence in the institution
