          <p><strong>S2W-7186</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what plans it has to commission nationwide 
            studies on the effect of wind turbines on the environment in order 
            to comply with Council Directive 2001/42/EC, which comes into force

          <p><strong>S2W-7187</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what advice it has given to planning authorities 
            concerning the assessment and mitigation of peat slide risk at wind 
            farm sites and whether this advice was reassessed following the peat 
            slide at Derrybrien in the Republic of Ireland which a report from 
            Applied Ground Engineering Consultants states was triggered by the 
            construction of a wind farm.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-7188</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what level of funding it has provided to

            a test of proportionate advantage to any proposed closure of a rural 
            primary school.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-7190</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether local authorities should, when proposing 
            to close schools, ensure that the educational and financial gains

            effects that the closure may have on the rural community, children 
            and families concerned.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-7191</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it concurs with Scottish Office policy 
            from 1998 that acknowledged the importance of ensuring that all those 
            consulted on rural school closure proposals feel that they have been 
            listened to and have had the opportunity to properly assess the balance 
            of arguments for and against the proposals.</P>

            Scottish Executive what the total amount is of capital resources provided 
            through all private finance initiative and public private partnership
