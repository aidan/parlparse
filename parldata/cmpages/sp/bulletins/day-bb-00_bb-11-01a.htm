            in all its dealings with the Parliament and its Committees; further 
            notes both the Parliament’s right and duty to hold the Executive to 
            account including the power to invoke section 23 of the Scotland Act 
            and the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of exchanges

            that other Parliaments with strong freedom of information regimes 
            do not disclose the terms of such exchanges; calls, to that end, for 
            the Executive and the Parliament to observe the following principles:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(i) consistent with its 
            policy of openness, the Executive should always seek to make as much 
            information as possible publicly available as a matter of course and 
            should respond positively to requests for information from the Parliament 
            and its Committees;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(ii) officials are accountable 
            to Ministers and Ministers in turn are accountable to the Parliament 
            and it follows that, while officials can provide Committees with factual 
            information, Committees should look to Ministers to account for the 
            policy decisions they have taken;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(iii) where, exceptionally, 
            Committees find it necessary to scrutinise exchanges between officials 
            and Ministers on policy issues, arrangements should be made to ensure 
            that the confidentiality of these exchanges is respected,</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and commends these principles
