<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on  which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments  lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin  every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains  any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the  Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked  with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3636 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Reporting  Knife-Related Injuries&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament acknowledges the cross-party  consensus to reduce knife crime in Scotland; recognises that knife crime  remains a persistent problem in Scotland and that, according to a study by  Glasgow Royal Infirmary, only 53% of knife-related assaults are ever reported  to the police; agrees that it is vital that hospitals notify the police when  they have knowledge of a knife-related injury, thus giving police the  opportunity to investigate every knife crime that is actually committed in  Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to require NHS boards to  implement a system whereby all knife-related injuries are reported to the police.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3635 Frances Curran: Terminate  Fizzy Drinks in Schools&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament is surprised to be  congratulating free marketeer and Republican Governor of California, Arnold  Schwarzenegger, who has banned fizzy drinks, including Coca-Cola, from all schools  in California in an attempt to target childhood obesity; notes that the  &ldquo;Terminator&rdquo; has terminated the sale of these drinks in schools in the same  period that the Scottish Executive has been unable to decide what to do;  further notes that Scotland is now lagging behind many countries which have  also banned junk food and drink from their schools, and believes that decisive  action on banning junk food and drink in schools cannot come soon enough in  Scotland, where child obesity levels in Scotland have doubled in the last 10  years.</p>
<p>Supported by: Carolyn  Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3634 Stewart Stevenson: Banking  in Rural Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament deplores the attempt by Clydesdale  Bank to prevent the possible takeover of their closure-threatened branches by  the Royal Bank of Scotland; notes that for many of the rural communities  affected the existence of a bank is a vital part of their infrastructure that  anchors local business and personal life, and calls on Clydesdale Bank to  abandon its current &ldquo;dog-in-the-manger&rdquo; attitude and co-operate with any  organisation willing to continue banking services in affected towns and  villages.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3633 Brian Adam on behalf of the Standards and Public Appointments  Committee: Interests of Members  of the Scottish Parliament Bill&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees to the general  principles of the Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill  Butler<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>S2M-3632 Pauline McNeill: Parliament Welcomes the Civil Partnership Act&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes  the Civil Partnership Act 2004, which comes into force on 5 December 2005; recognises that the  Act, which seeks to give social and legal inclusion to couples of the same sex,  will be a major step forward for equality, and congratulates everyone at the  Scottish Executive, the UK Government and the Scottish and UK Parliaments who  contributed to the drafting of the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3631 Shona Robison: Point of Delivery&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the recent Macmillan  Cancer Relief report, <em>Free at the Point  of Delivery?</em>, which highlights the financial burden that travelling to and  from hospital for regular treatment places on cancer patients; is concerned  that there is no record of the percentage of cancer patients in Scotland who  are currently eligible for reimbursement of their travel costs under the  Hospital Travel Costs Scheme, possibly leaving many cancer patients on low  incomes without much-needed financial support; considers that action is needed  to increase the number of eligible patients who are claiming reimbursement  under the scheme, through improved awareness and advice, and urges the Scottish  Executive to look at extending the scheme to cancer patients not receiving  benefits, as is done in the non-means-tested Highlands and Islands scheme.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3630 Eleanor Scott: Food for Life&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament commends the Soil Association&rsquo;s  Food for Life project for its tremendously positive work in promoting food  education and school food that is 75% fresh and unprocessed, 50% locally  produced and 30% organic; is delighted that the project is flourishing with  schools across Scotland already taking part and many more due to join in the  near future; congratulates Hurlford Primary School in Kilmarnock, East  Ayrshire, one of the Food for Life schools, for its success in winning the Soil  Association&rsquo;s Food for Life School of the Year Award and believes that this is  an appropriate accolade given the health benefits to children of the project;  recognises the economic and social benefits of local food procurement to  Scottish food producers, particularly in remote rural areas, and urges the  Scottish Executive to promote Food for Life as the logical progression from the  Hungry for Success and Health Promoting Schools schemes.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3626*#* Cathy Peattie: 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates  all those involved in the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence Campaign;  notes that, since 1991, approximately 1,700 organizations in 130 countries have  participated in the 16 days campaign; notes that the theme of this year&rsquo;s  campaign is &ldquo;For the Health of Women, For the Health of the World: No More  Violence&rdquo;,&nbsp;and&nbsp;believes that, while in recent years much has been  done in Scotland to increase awareness and improve and extend services,  including broadening the focus of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s strategy to  encompass all forms of violence against women, there is clearly still much to  do in all these respects, both within Scotland&nbsp;and as part of the  international movement for the&nbsp;elimination of&nbsp;violence  against&nbsp;women.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3625 Carolyn Leckie: Stop Violence Against Women - Support Amnesty International&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament congratulates Amnesty International on its Stop Violence Against  Women campaign and its latest initiative, &ldquo;16 days of Activism to Stop Violence  Against Women&rdquo;; regrets, however, that such campaigns are still necessary and  is particularly concerned that recent attitude surveys reflect that an  unacceptably large proportion of the population blame women for rapes  perpetrated by men; is further concerned that conviction rates for rape have  decreased and that those rapes that end up in court are a tiny proportion of  rapes actually committed; believes and affirms that rape is a brutal expression  of power over, and violence against, women, that it is always the responsibility  of the perpetrator and never the victim, that the media contribute to a climate  where sexist and misogynist attitudes to women are given credence, and further  believes that fundamental attitudinal change must be achieved throughout the  criminal justice system for women to have the confidence to report and pursue  rape allegations and that the Parliament has the responsibility to lead that  attitudinal change in the criminal justice system and wider society.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms  Rosemary Byrne, Frances Curran, Rosie Kane, Linda Fabiani, Ms Sandra White,  Tommy Sheridan</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3624 Margo MacDonald: Urgent Request for a Ministerial Statement&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament requests  that the First Minister makes a statement on the discussions that have taken  place between himself and Home Office ministers concerning the methods used to  remove failed asylum seekers from Scotland, in light of his spokesman&rsquo;s  statement at lunchtime on 23 November 2005 which made it clear that the First  Minister had not reflected the Parliament&rsquo;s opposition to the &ldquo;dawn raids&rdquo; in  his meetings with Home Office ministers to date and believes that, in advance  of his meeting on 24 November 2005 with the Home Office Minister, Tony McNulty,  he must re-state the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s position on this matter.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3623 Carolyn Leckie: Scottish Executive Failing Women on Equal Pay&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament is  concerned that the Scottish Executive in its local government finance  settlement fails to comply with its obligations to do all that it can to  achieve equal pay; recognises that these obligations are the encouragement of  equal opportunities, in particular the observance of equal opportunities  requirements and the imposition of duties on Scottish public authorities and  cross-border authorities in relation to their Scottish functions; believes  that, given that local authorities in Scotland are resisting full settlement of  equal pay for women on the grounds of insufficient funding and the risk to  council services and jobs and recommending acceptance of compensation  arrangements that fall well below what women would be confident of achieving by  pursuing their legal entitlement, the Executive could and should have made the  necessary funds available to achieve equal pay, both retrospectively and prospectively,  but has not; further believes, therefore, that the Executive has not met the  financial, legal, political or moral challenge of achieving equal pay and has  stood by whilst the unequal pay of women has subsidised public services, and  considers that only urgent direct action by the Executive on this issue,  including the allocation of sufficient resources, will deliver results that  match the Executive pronouncements on equality and preserve public services and  the jobs of local authority workers.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3619 Christine Grahame: Scott&rsquo;s Selkirk&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises  the benefits that Scott&rsquo;s Selkirk contributes to the local economy, running as  it does on Saturday and Sunday, 3 and 4 December 2005; notes that it  commemorates the ride of Sir Walter Scott into Selkirk from Clovenfords, and  then from Abbotsford, to dispense justice in the courthouse that still  dominates Selkirk&rsquo;s market place; further notes these words from <em>Marmion </em>&ldquo;Heap  on more wood! - the wind is chill; But let it whistle as it will, We&rsquo;ll keep  our Christmas merry still... While music, mirth, and social cheer speed on  their wings the passing year.&rdquo;; further notes that during the weekend there are  living history performances including the re-enactment of Scott&rsquo;s court cases,  together with street theatre and stalls, and congratulates the Souters of  Selkirk on celebrating this extraordinary Borderer with such panache.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3616 Patrick Harvie: Ministerial Commitments on Asylum Protocol&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes  the groundswell of opposition to current asylum removal practices being carried  out by the Home Office in Scotland; reasserts its view, as expressed in motion  S2M-3323 agreed by the Parliament on 22 September 2005, that an agreement is needed  between the Home Office and the Scottish Executive which would protect the  welfare of children facing removal; notes the commitment made in the Parliament  on the same day by the First Minister to seek a &ldquo;protocol&rdquo; for this purpose and  to report back to the Parliament on progress; notes the First Minister&rsquo;s  statement on 29 September 2005 that the Home Secretary &ldquo;has agreed that the  establishment of such an agreement in Scotland and, perhaps, elsewhere would be  advisable&rdquo;; notes the Deputy First Minister&rsquo;s assurances to the Parliament on  the 27 October 2005 that &ldquo;the First Minister and the Home Secretary have  reached an agreement in principle on the issue&rdquo; and that the protocol would  change removal practices rather than describe existing practice; notes with  dismay that the Home Office has this week briefed journalists to the effect  that no such protocol will be agreed with the Executive; considers that  Scottish ministers have a responsibility to speak honestly in the Parliament  and elsewhere, and considers that the contradiction between the ministers&rsquo;  statements and the Home Office briefing raises the possibility that the First  Minister may have misled the Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3609 Alex Johnstone: Impact of Private Water Supplies (Scotland) Regulations&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament notes with concern the impact of the Private Water Supplies  (Scotland) Regulations 2005 on hundreds of small businesses throughout  Scotland, which could be facing bills of up to &pound;10,000 to upgrade their water  supply as a consequence, and urges the Scottish Executive to consider  increasing the grant support on offer to those businesses affected, which would  help to protect vulnerable jobs and services in rural businesses.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3608 Eleanor Scott: Reducing Speed Limits for Road Safety&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates  Brake, the road safety charity, for its Road Safety Week on the theme of &ldquo;Watch  out! There&rsquo;s a kid about&rdquo;; notes with alarm that road traffic is the biggest  killer of 12 to 16-year-olds in Britain and that last year the number of road  deaths of 12 to 19-year-olds on foot rose by 26%; commends and supports the  residents of Lerwick who are campaigning to reduce speed limits in residential  areas to 20 miles per hour; believes that 20 miles per hour speed limits around  schools should be more tightly enforced and extended to all residential areas,  and urges the Scottish Executive, local authorities and the police to take  urgent steps to reduce road deaths and injuries in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3607 Rob Gibson: Congratulations to Glas Cymru&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates  Glas Cymru, the owners of Dwr Cymru/Welsh Water, for attaining the position of joint  top-performing private water and sewerage company in Wales and England with  Yorkshire Water this year; particularly notes that Glas Cymru is a  not-for-profit trust that has no shareholders and reinvests all its financial  surpluses for the benefit of customers; welcomes its dividend strategy which  will maintain or increase the &pound;18 level of bonus paid to<strong> </strong>its one million  customers this year; believes that Scottish Water should be transformed into a  not-for-profit trust in the public sector that could reduce costs to Scottish  customers instead of expecting to charge excessive rates to domestic and,  especially, business water users, a practice that will continue with the  Scottish Executive&rsquo;s chosen model, which is due for the next determination by  the Water Commission on St Andrew&rsquo;s Day, and notes that this practice is  locking<strong> </strong>Scottish Water customers into a punitive charge regime that has  resulted in<strong> </strong>capital expenditure being mainly funded by current water  charge payers since 2003.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3607.1 Murdo Fraser: Congratulations to Glas Cymru&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3607)  in the name of Rob Gibson, leave out from&nbsp;first &ldquo;Scottish&rdquo; to end and  insert &ldquo;, if Scottish Water was transformed into a mutual company or  not-for-profit trust in the private sector along the lines of Glas Cymru, it  could reduce costs to Scottish customers instead of expecting to charge  excessive rates to domestic and, especially, business water users, a practice  that will continue with the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s chosen model, and concludes  that the benefits to be gained from adopting the Welsh model would be lost if  Scottish Water were to be retained in the public sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3606 Alex Johnstone: Arbroath Abbey World Heritage Site Status&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament supports  a campaign to encourage the UK Government to obtain World Heritage Site status  from UNESCO for Arbroath Abbey, not only on the basis of its connection with  the Declaration of Arbroath of 1320 but also for its outstanding architecture;  recognises that the Declaration of Arbroath more than satisfies UNESCO&rsquo;s  requirement for the site to be directly associated with literary works of  outstanding universal significance, and considers that the Scottish Executive  should support Arbroath Abbey as an excellent Scottish candidate for the UK  Tentative List.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3605 Christine Grahame: Scottish Produce in the Scottish Parliament&mdash;</strong>That  the Parliament notes the success of Scottish Food Fortnight and celebrates the  quality food produced Scotland-wide; regrets that the members&rsquo; dining room in  Holyrood, which plays host to many guests across Scotland and internationally,  rarely features home produce, and therefore calls on the Scottish Parliamentary  Corporate Body to take appropriate measures to ensure that the dining room  becomes a showcase for Scottish produce featuring regions of Scotland on a  rotational basis.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3549# Alex Neil: Council Tax in Very Sheltered Housing&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament expresses  astonishment and concern at the decision of the valuation boards in  Renfrewshire and Lanarkshire to designate single rooms occupied by residents of  very sheltered housing complexes, such as Abbeyfield Homes in Coatbridge, as  being fully liable for council tax; furthermore notes that a review of this  matter is currently being undertaken by the Scottish Executive; recognises that  this injustice has to be rectified as a matter of urgency by redesignating each  very sheltered housing complex as being liable for council tax as a whole  rather than individual living units, and believes that any council tax payments  made as a result of the current designation should be refunded.</p>
