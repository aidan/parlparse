<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8179 Tom McCabe on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body: Reimbursement of Members&rsquo; Expenses Scheme Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 81(2) and 83(5) of the Scotland Act 1998 determines that for the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2013 paragraph 1.2.4 of the Reimbursement of Members&rsquo; Expenses Scheme agreed to by resolution of the Parliament on 12 June 2008 (&quot;the Resolution&quot;), (as amended by resolution of the Parliament on 24 March 2010) and annexed as Annex 1 to the Resolution shall not have effect.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8178 Ian McKee: Nuclear Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the radioactive leaks from Japan&rsquo;s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant following the recent earthquakes and tsunami that have devastated the region; believes that Fukushima demonstrates that, even in the world&rsquo;s most technologically and scientifically advanced nations, it is impossible to guarantee safety in the running of atomic plants; welcomes the news that, following the Fukushima incident, the Swiss Government has suspended plans to build and replace nuclear plants and that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced a three-month suspension of a law aimed at prolonging the activity of old nuclear plants; further welcomes the emergency meeting that has been called by the EU energy commissioner to discuss the possible application of EU-wide stress tests for the 143 nuclear reactors currently operating in EU territory and to debate the wider issue of nuclear security in Europe; endorses the SNP government&rsquo;s position that Scotland, which it considers to be a world leader in green, clean, reliable renewable energy, does not require nuclear power, and challenges the other political parties in Scotland and across the United Kingdom to unite on the issue by adopting a similar stance.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christopher Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Shirley-Anne Somerville<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-8177 Charlie Gordon: Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that market failure in the bus industry requires legislation to regulate bus services in the best interests of the travelling public.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8176 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
<p>Groups 1 and 2: 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-8175 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
