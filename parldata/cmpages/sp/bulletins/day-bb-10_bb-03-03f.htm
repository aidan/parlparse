                                        <p><strong>* S3M-5872 Patricia Ferguson: Factoring Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Office of Fair Trading market study into the property management market found that the market is not working well for consumers in Scotland; welcomes the recent cross-party support for proposals to require property factors to register and to make provision for an accessible form of dispute resolution between homeowners and property factors, and further welcomes this positive progress toward the introduction of legislation to ensure better accountability of property managers for their standards and the services that they provide.</p>
                                        <p><strong>* S3M-5871 Michael Russell: Educating Children and Young People to Compete in a Globalised 21st Century</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that in the globalised and increasingly interconnected 21st century it is essential that young people are equipped with the skills and capacities needed to succeed in the global marketplace; further recognises that it is essential that learning is placed in an international context, including learning about Scotland and its place in the world, as an integrated element of the curriculum; supports the aim of promoting Scotland&rsquo;s education system and bolstering the international reputation thatScotland enjoys for excellence in education, and notes theScottish Government&rsquo;s determination to learn from other countries&rsquo; education systems to ensure thatScotland further improve its performance and applies a global perspective to its approach and ambitions.</p>
                                        <p><strong>* S3M-5870 Jamie Hepburn: Remembering Thomas Muir of Huntershill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recalls the life and work of the 18th century political reformer, Thomas Muir, often known as Thomas Muir of Huntershill; recognises that, for his advocacy of the democratisation of the Scottish and British political system, he was sentenced to be transported to Australia, with his trial being marked by Robert Burns acknowledging that it had at least in part served as inspiration to write <em>Scots Wha Hae</em>; remembers that, following his escape from the Australian penal colony and flight to the Americas, he was held in Spanish captivity where he was seriously wounded before being released into French protection, arriving in France to be hailed as a martyr of liberty before dying at the age of 33 in relative obscurity; believes that Muir is still too obscure a figure today given his importance to the democratisation of Scotland; considers that more should be done to raise awareness of the life of Thomas Muir of Huntershill; notes that a petition is presently before the Scottish Parliament in the name of Paddy Scott Hogg, calling for the erection of a statue in memory of Thomas Muir, and believes that this might be an appropriate way to commemorate him.</p>
