<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-83</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Rural Development Plan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the draft Scottish Rural Development Plan produced by the previous Scottish Executive, especially the aspirations to promote environmentally sustainable farming and to promote action on climate change and better water management; regrets previous underfunding of agri-environment measures, and urges the Scottish Executive to maximise funding in the forthcoming programme to ensure that the desirable objectives set out in the draft Scottish Rural Development Plan can be met.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-82&diams; </strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Re-regulation of Scotland&rsquo;s Buses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the plight of communities throughout Scotland where the lack of an accessible bus service makes hospital visits, shopping trips and other routine journeys unacceptably difficult and notes that this problem is particularly acute for elderly people and for young families; further notes that hundreds of Maryhill residents have indicated their support for the re-regulation of bus services, and considers that steps towards re-regulation should be taken as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-81#</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Rescue from Moving Water</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the rising number of incidents involving persons trapped in moving water, including incidents in the River Tay at Perth on 23 July and 21 September 2006 and 6 March 2007, two of which resulted in deaths; further notes that there is no clear duty imposed on fire and rescue services to rescue from moving water, resulting in inconsistent practice across Scotland and the threat of disciplinary action against officers who carry out rescues outwith their operational remit, and considers that this is a situation which requires urgent review.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-80&diams; </strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Can&rsquo;t Afford to Foster</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the valuable contribution made by Scotland&rsquo;s foster carers; notes with concern that there is a shortage of 1,700 fostering households in Scotland, including in the Scottish Borders; further notes that, at a time when more children, many of whom display challenging behaviour, are living with foster carers than at any other time, 37% of foster carers receive no payment at all while two-thirds of those who are paid receive less than the minimum wage, and accordingly considers that the fostering network should be supported as a matter of priority.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-79#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Read All About It</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent launch of <em>Local News for Westenders</em>, which complements <em>Local News for Southsiders</em>, one of Glasgow&rsquo;s most widely distributed free titles; congratulates <em>Local News for Southsiders</em> on its 10th birthday as a totally independent community newspaper, which is distributed at more than 300 busy public spots, from the Gorbals to Govan and from Pollok to Castlemilk; salutes the paper&rsquo;s ethos of highlighting the positive things happening in the Southside and the successes of local people and businesses but without steering clear of controversy, and wishes it and the new arrival all the success in the future in providing an invaluable public service for communities.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-74</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>The Crown Estate and Scotland&rsquo;s Seabed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance to Scotland of the seas around its shores, which support fishing, aquaculture, tourism and marine transport industries, and increasingly will support Scotland&rsquo;s growing marine renewable energy industry; further notes that the control of the seabed remains with the Crown Estate which controls most marine developments and levies charges for the use of the seabed; believes that, if Scotland&rsquo;s coastal and island communities are to be sustained and Scotland&rsquo;s marine renewable energy potential is to be developed for the maximum benefit of Scotland, control of the seabed should pass to democratically accountable Scottish authorities, and therefore further believes that the opportunity presented by the proposed UK Marine Bill to devolve control of Scotland&rsquo;s seabed to Scotland should be taken and that, in the meantime, the Scottish Executive should examine the conclusions of the Crown Estate Review Working Group in order to use every opportunity to use devolved powers to maximise Scotland&rsquo;s influence over the operation of the Crown Estate in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-50</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Single Transferable Vote</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the single transferable vote deeply disadvantages candidates with surnames towards the end of the alphabet when two or more candidates from a single party stand in the same council ward; is aware that in Cunninghame North, in the eight instances that two or more candidates from either the Conservative, Labour or Scottish National party stood, in every case the candidate whose surname came first in the alphabet obtained a much higher number of votes for that ward than colleagues whose surnames were further on in the alphabet; notes that the bigger the alphabetic gap the bigger the gulf in votes; is aware that this took place even on the two occasions where surnames were grouped by party and that the pattern was repeated elsewhere in Scotland, and therefore resolves, in the interests of fairness, that where more than one candidate from a party stands, their position on the ballot paper should be decided by lottery.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-49</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Date of Scottish Parliament and Local Authority Elections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that Scotland would be better served by having Scottish Parliament and local authority elections on separate dates.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-48</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Parliament Elections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continued apathy with which a large segment of the population views elections to the Scottish Parliament and local government; believes that the plethora of electorally insignificant parties and campaign literature freely delivered by Royal Mail contributes to confusion and voter fatigue, and calls on the Scottish Executive to hold discussions with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government with a view to increasing the number of members a party must have in order to stand in elections from three to 100, ensuring that new political parties register a year or more before polling day, abolishing free delivery of election communications by Royal Mail, and introducing a deposit for each candidate standing on the regional list.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-47*#*</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Threatened Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply concerned at Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s proposals to reduce the number of post offices in Scotland from 1,664 in December 2006, two-thirds of which are in rural and island communities, by upwards of 200 by 2009; is aware that in Cunninghame North, Kilmory Post Office on the Island of Arran has already closed this year and that, according to Hansard, 16 of the remaining 23 in the constituency are under threat; recognises that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s action in recent years has directly contributed towards the reduction in post office numbers by removing vital services essential for their economic viability such as pensions, benefits, television licences and soon driving licences, while diverting much of its own business from the Royal Mail to the private sector; acknowledges that post offices provide a vital social, as well as economic, service often to very vulnerable people, at the heart of large and small communities alike; notes that Postwatch Scotland, responding to the recent Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) consultation, stated that the DTI did not take Scotland&rsquo;s special circumstances into account as its proposals &quot;seem to have been prepared without any consideration of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policy framework on rural development, social inclusion and sustainable development&quot;; opposes the threat to the Universal Service Obligation, and believes that the Executive should express its opposition to further post office closures in the strongest possible terms and take practical steps where possible to ameliorate Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s action by channelling Executive business towards the Royal Mail, enhancing the post office card account and using it as a basis for community banking, working with local authorities to support post offices as part of rural and urban development projects, improving post office access to European small business funding and establishing a rural community action programme similar to that provided by the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-39#</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Expanding Higher Education Provision at the Crichton Campus in Dumfries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the creation of the University of the West of Scotland, through the merger of the University of Paisley and Bell College, and its commitment to its four sites, including the Crichton Campus in Dumfries; believes that this should result in increased opportunities for higher education in Dumfries and Galloway but recognises that this will not substitute for the undergraduate courses offered at the Crichton by the University of Glasgow; is therefore very concerned that Glasgow University does not intend to recruit any first-year undergraduate students this year, and believes that the Scottish Executive should continue to work with the Scottish Funding Council and the University of Glasgow to find a solution that will reverse this position and will guarantee that Glasgow University will continue to offer undergraduate degree courses to students at the Crichton.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-38*#*</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Town Centre Regeneration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the pressing need for regeneration of many of our town centres, including Dumfries, the county town of Dumfries and Galloway; believes that national and local agencies should work together to develop local plans, and further believes that the Scottish Executive should consider enabling the establishment of town centre trusts with legal powers to initiate compulsory purchase orders and also consider setting up a town centre turnaround fund as part of this year&rsquo;s spending review.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-37#</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Success of Community Warden Scheme in North West Dumfries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the success of the community warden scheme in north-west Dumfries in tackling antisocial behaviour, promoting alternative activities for young people and working with the police to improve safety in the local community; welcomes the extension of the scheme into other parts of Dumfries and Galloway, such as Annan, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider making further funding available to enable local authorities to increase the numbers of community wardens working in their communities.</p>
