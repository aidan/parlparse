<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7176 John Scott: Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success of the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme, which helps many churches and other places of worship meet the costs of essential maintenance; notes that this interim grant scheme was introduced in 2001 and returns in grant aid the difference between 5% and the actual amount spent on VAT on eligible repairs and maintenance to listed places of worship; further notes that this scheme is due to end on 31 March 2011; believes that the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme continues to play a valuable role in supporting and maintaining places of worship, and urges UK ministers to continue the scheme beyond March 2011.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7175&diams;
  Liam McArthur: The Success of the Air Discount Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that, since its introduction in May 2006, the Air Discount Scheme has brought great benefits to the residents of eligible areas of the Highlands and Islands by reducing the cost of their air fares on the vital lifeline air routes to the main Scottish airports; is of the view that the European Commission&rsquo;s approval of the scheme as aid of a social character recognises that residents of Scotland&rsquo;s islands and the far north of the mainland face disproportionately high costs in gaining access to services of the mainland and that they deserve this support to reduce the cost; believes that the case for the Air Discount Scheme is as strong today as it was in 2006, and looks forward to its continuation for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7173 Robin Harper: New Building Standards Regulations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the introduction of new energy standards in building regulations from 1 October 2010 and the target of achieving a 30% improvement in CO2 emissions in new buildings compared with the previous standards in 2007; considers that there has been a paucity of investment in the ongoing skills training of building control officers who will be required to implement the new regulations; understands that relatively inexpensive insulation and airtightness technologies are already available that could achieve results of 20% above the new targets, and calls on the Scottish Government to institute a full review of the housebuilding industry, including the contribution that small builders could make through retrofitting insulation and airtightness improvements, with a view to setting a better target and ensuring that housing can make a larger contribution to the 2020 and 2050 climate change targets.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7172 Jackie Baillie: Red Cross Volunteers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates eight young British Red Cross volunteers from Helensburgh on being shortlisted to receive a Humanitarian Citizen Award; notes that Gillian Allan, Becky Beniston, Julia Brown, Madeline Grant, Florence Joseph, David O&rsquo;Neil, Jade Scott and Jasna Wardle were selected as a result of what is considered to be the hard work and commitment that they have demonstrated to the Red Cross; understands that the group has collectively completed extensive first aid training and attended fundraising events and, by doing so, considers that they have raised awareness of the work of the Red Cross, and congratulates all of them on being what is believed to be excellent role models for young people in their community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7171 Charlie Gordon: St Oswald&rsquo;s Does the Hat Trick</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Oswald&rsquo;s RC School in Cathcart in Glasgow on becoming one of around 100 schools in Scotland to be awarded a third Green Flag as an eco-school; notes that St Oswald&rsquo;s pupils, who have additional support needs, work regularly to enhance the amenity of a local park and help to maintain the gardens of older local residents, and considers that the achievements of these pupils are a credit to their school, to their teachers and, above all, to themselves.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7170 Jim Hume: ICC Cricket World Cup</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the International Cricket Council&rsquo;s (ICC) Chief Executive Committee&rsquo;s recent proposals to reduce the number of participants in the ICC Cricket World Cup from 14 sides to 10; considers that this will have a significant impact on the Scottish national side&rsquo;s ability to qualify for the tournament to compete against the world&rsquo;s best sides, as it did in 1999 and 2007; believes that the ICC Cricket World Cup performs an important function as an incentive to work toward for the largely amateur players who make up the national side as well as serving as a barometer of the national side&rsquo;s progress on the international stage; considers it unfortunate that cricket&rsquo;s premier international tournament is contracting when international events in competing sports are expanding, and calls on the International Cricket Council board to reject the proposal when it is brought before them for consideration.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7169&diams;
  Helen Eadie: World Arthritis Day, 12 October 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that World Arthritis Day takes place on 12 October 2010; understands that arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions are a major cause of pain and disability, accounting for 48% of all work-related illness in Scotland; considers that this places a significant burden on both the NHS and society; acknowledges that it is estimated that over one million people consulted a GP or practice nurse in 2008-09 in relation to a musculoskeletal condition and that there were over one hundred thousand NHS hospital stays in Scotland in 2009 for which a musculoskeletal condition is recorded;  pays tribute to organisations working to raise awareness of arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, such as the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance, Arthritis Care Scotland, the National Osteoporosis Society in Scotland, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), Scottish Inflammatory Diseases and Rheumatology Industry Group (SIDRIG), the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) and Psoriasis Scotland Arthritis Link Volunteers; looks forward to the publication of the national musculoskeletal programme and considers that it has the potential to develop a national framework for improving the standards of care for people who live with all forms of arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions; understands that a national lead has been appointed to support this work and a national programme board to ensure implementation; believes that people living with musculoskeletal conditions can usefully input to the national programme board, and would welcome publication of research into the prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions and on improving treatments and their impact on local NHS services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7168 Tom McCabe: Scrapping of Universal Child Benefit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government to abandon the principle of universal child benefit by what it considers to be crudely removing the eligibility of households with a higher rate taxpayer to receive that allowance; is concerned at this as it believes that it is an unfair decision that punishes families with one income just beyond the eligibility threshold while continuing with what it considers to be the unjust targeting of children following the removal of the child trust fund; believes that this undermines the principle that every child is entitled to child benefit and the protection that children are entitled to from the government of the day, and calls on Liberal Democrats in Scotland to distance themselves from what it believes is this unfair measure.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7167 Angela Constance: Broxburn and Uphall War Memorial</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament records with pride the dedication ceremony held on Sunday 3 October 2010 to celebrate the new war memorial for the communities of Broxburn and Uphall; pays tribute to what it considers to be the hard work, commitment and vision of the Broxburn and Uphall War Memorial Group; applauds the work of the artist, Alan Beattie Herriot, who designed the statue and memorial, which was based on a drawing by Stephen McMahon of St Nicholas Primary School, and believes that this lasting memorial will provide a focal point for the Broxburn and Uphall communities to remember the generations of servicemen and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their people and their country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7166 Angela Constance: Opening of Eliburn Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the official opening of Eliburn Park in Livingston after nine years of what it considers to be concerted effort by West Lothian Council, the local community and the Friends of Eliburn Park group; believes this to be a fantastic facility; congratulates schoolchildren Dylan Gallacher, Sarah Haggarty, Holly Harrison, Craig Wilson and Maddison Meek on being the prize winners of the picture competition to mark the occasion, and believes that the new park, play provision and facilities will provide recreation for young and old alike for generations to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7164.1 David Whitton: Refresh of the Skills Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7164) in the name of Keith Brown, insert at end &quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that there is sustained investment in skills training to meet the recognised demand for a well skilled, well trained workforce.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7164.2 Elizabeth Smith: Refresh of the Skills Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7164) in the name of Keith Brown, insert at end &quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to fully engage employers in the process of ensuring that the system is more demand-led and that publicly funded training matches far more closely the needs of employers.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7164.3 Margaret Smith: Refresh of the Skills Strategy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7164) in the name of Keith Brown, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the publication of the refreshed Skills for Scotland skills strategy, three years after the original strategy was rejected by the Parliament; regrets the confusion and bureaucracy in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach to the skills system and meeting the needs of the key economic sectors and industries of the future, and believes that the priority given by the Scottish Government to the new centralised skills quango, Skills Development Scotland, which has &pound;22 million of administrative expenses, has not added any clarity to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s skills agenda.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7157.1 Gavin Brown: The Future of Scotland&rsquo;s Supported Employment Workplaces</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7157) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, insert at end &quot;, and, in so doing, take account of the fact that there may be a small minority of public bodies that will face practical difficulties in achieving this aim, and, in addition, believes that main contractors should be actively encouraged, on a voluntary basis, to use supported employment organisations as subcontractors on public sector contracts.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7157.2 Jim Mather: The Future of Scotland&rsquo;s Supported Employment Workplaces</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7157) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, insert at end &quot;, and notes the recognition given to sustainability in the procurement reform programme and in particular the progress on community benefit clauses.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6895*#* Jim Hume: Improved Mobile Phone Coverage in Rural Areas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament understands the importance of adequate mobile phone coverage in rural areas; further understands the benefits to community safety and the local economy that such coverage would provide; *would welcome the provision of* reliable network coverage in rural, remote and isolated communities, and congratulates Ettrick and Yarrow Community Council for taking the lead on highlighting this matter.</p>
