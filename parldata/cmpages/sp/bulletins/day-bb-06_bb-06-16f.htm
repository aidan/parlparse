<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4569</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Labour MPs Failing on Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route VAT Issue</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns Aberdeen&rsquo;s Labour MPs for their backing of HM Treasury&rsquo;s stance on imposing VAT on the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route project; notes that the former Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning has stated publicly that there was no notification from HM Revenue and Customs that it was looking at imposing VAT, and calls on these MPs to rethink their position and back the campaign to have this VAT liability waived.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4568</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>General Dental Council (Professions Complementary to Dentistry) Regulations Order of Council 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the General Dental Council (Professions Complementary to Dentistry) Regulations Order of Council 2006 (SI 2006/1440).</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4567</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>The Draft Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006 (Consequential Modifications) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the draft Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006 (Consequential Modifications) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4566</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Barnardo&rsquo;s and Support for Children Abused Through Prostitution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that a long-term study has been carried out by Barnardo&rsquo;s into its work with children who have been exploited for sex or groomed for abuse through prostitution; understands that the research indicates that early intervention in the lives of these young people reduces their risk of exploitation and helps them achieve positive changes in their lives; commends Barnardo&rsquo;s Glasgow Street Team for its work supporting children and young people at risk of sexual exploitation but is concerned that such support depends more on geography than need, and looks forward to local authorities across Scotland developing the protocols for working with young people at risk of sexual exploitation, as called for in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s 2003 strategy on vulnerable children.</p>
<p>Supported by: Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>, Maureen Macmillan<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong>, Roseanna Cunningham<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong>, Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4565</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Members&rsquo; Dining Room - Scottish Fortnight</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Scottish Fortnight in the members&rsquo; dining room from 4 to 15 September 2006, which will showcase such delectations as grilled Finnan smoked haddie, seared Perthshire lamb chops, supreme of Letham chicken, pressed Fife pigeon terrine, Ayrshire bacon broth, bread pudding with Dundee marmalade and Eccelfechan butter tart, showcasing Scottish produce and recipes, and considers that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should, so far as possible, in allocating catering contracts, endeavour to secure agreements which maximise the use of Scottish produce with a view to this two week taster becoming a permanent feature in the members&rsquo; dining room.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4564</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Welcome Lanarkshire Health United</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Lanarkshire Health United to the Parliament on 15 June 2006 to protest against the decision of NHS Lanarkshire to exclude the option of improving and enhancing the status quo from its consultation and final options for the organisation of acute health services in Lanarkshire; recognises that the majority of people in Lanarkshire wish to keep both elective and emergency services together at their local hospital; believes that NHS Lanarkshire has arrogantly disregarded their views, and believes that the Executive should refer back any recommendations by NHS Lanarkshire to ensure a proper examination of the &quot;status quo plus&quot; and proper analysis of the steps necessary to deliver such an option in full and proper engagement with the public.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4563</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that on 12 June 2006 the Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston, refused to meet a cross-party delegation of MSPs, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, a former Lord Advocate and representatives of Scotland&rsquo;s trade unions, churches and civic society and that Aldermaston did not respond to the delegation&rsquo;s concern that over &pound;1 billion is being spent on new facilities at Aldermaston which are likely to be used to design and build new nuclear weapons that would be deployed in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Westminster Government in respect of its plans for Aldermaston.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4562</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Crofting Reform etc. Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Crofting Reform etc. Bill, agrees to any expenditure or increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in Rule 9.12.3(b)(iii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4561</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Closure of the National Minimum Wage Helpline for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the scourge of low pay in the United Kingdom, which, disgracefully under the Labour Government, has not been eradicated; notes that people caught in the poverty trap of low pay are more likely to be in debt and work longer hours to make ends meet as, for example, low-paid workers are more likely to have signed an opt-out of the EU Working Time Directive 48 hour maximum with their employers to make more money and could be working up to 80 to 100 hours per week; further notes that low pay results in poverty, debt, rent and mortgage arrears, poor health, stress, lower life expectancy and malnutrition and, for example, many working parents on low pay will ensure that their children have a meal and go without themselves; also notes the abolition of the wages councils and the introduction of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 allowing for a national minimum wage which employers must pay to their workers otherwise they are breaking the law and can be prosecuted and fined, as well as having to pay employees the backdated arrears; notes that since 1998 there have been many breaches of the national minimum wage regulations by employers and backdated arrears have been awarded to workers, but there has been not one prosecution of any company for breaking the law; further notes in this connection the significance of the National Minimum Wage Helpline for Scotland, which was set up in 2003, based at the office of the Scottish Low Pay Unit and funded by HM Revenue and Customs and the Department of Trade and Industry; condemns the Government&rsquo;s decision to cease funding the helpline, which means that it will have to close at the end of June 2006 if alternative funding is not found and notes that in 2005 the helpline achieved over &pound;15,000 in back pay for low-paid workers in Scotland who had not been paid the National Minimum Wage; notes that the helpline advised 1,003 low-paid workers and received enquiries from every single local authority area in Scotland and that after June 2006 low-paid workers in Scotland will have to call a helpline in Newcastle which is run by the UK Government and whose hours are going to be reduced while it operates as a helpline for the whole of the United Kingdom; further notes that the Scottish Executive has been contacted and asked if it will fund the National Minimum Wage helpline, which covers the whole of Scotland, to ensure its survival and notes that there has not yet been a positive response; further notes increasing cuts in the voluntary sector in Glasgow, such as the closure of the Scottish Human Rights Centre and the Scottish Civic Forum; believes that these cuts specifically target services for the most vulnerable communities and that when services are cut, not only do workers lose their jobs, but the entire community of low-paid workers, especially women as well as people of different race and ethnic backgrounds, loses valuable services; therefore challenges the cutting by the Government of a valuable helpline in Scotland which helps the poorest workers when at the same time it can spend millions of pounds on a war in Iraq that benefits no-one and calls on the Scottish Executive to secure the current funding and consider long-term funding of the helpline; regards it as a priority that enough public money in Scotland is made available to help the poorest paid workers in Scotland to enforce their right to a national minimum wage with independent professional advice, as well as catering for the needs of a rapidly expanding migrant workforce from Eastern Europe in Scotland who are being exploited as workers and frequently need advice on the national minimum wage, and considers that this has increased resonance at a time when the money needed to keep the helpline open, &pound;36,000, is insignificant when compared to the millions that it cost to build the Scottish Parliament and the public money that Scottish Enterprise has wasted in building up debts instead of creating jobs.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4560</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Buried News</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes, and expresses its disgust at, the announcement by the Minister for Health and Community Care of the closure of the Coldstream and Jedburgh cottage hospitals at exactly the same time that the Parliament was debating the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill; recognises that this was a shabby and relatively successful ploy to bury this bad news for eastern Borderers; recognises that this decision ignores the communities&rsquo; wishes, as expressed in meetings, including with the Minister, marches and petitions, and also ignores the thrust of the Kerr report on keeping such services local and comes and at a time when services for elderly people in the Borders are overstretched, and therefore calls for the coalition government to respect those communities and reverse the decision.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4559</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Knightswood Secondary School Under-18 Football Scottish Shield Victory</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the achievement of Knightswood Secondary School&rsquo;s under-18 football team which won the under-18 Scottish Shield at Hampden Park following a penalty shoot-out against St Ninian&rsquo;s High School; notes that this is the first time since the school opened in 1958 that Knightswood Secondary School has won the Scottish Shield, and congratulates the players, and team coaches, David Henderson and Ian McLeod, on the school&rsquo;s splendid victory.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4558</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Tickets for the 2012 London Olympics</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the call of Derek Wyatt MP, chair of the Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Olympic and Paralympic Group, that Londoners should be given the first chance to buy tickets for the London Olympic Games in 2012; believes that this is contrary to the international nature of these events; disputes the notion that Londoners deserve the first chance to buy tickets because of a levy on their council tax to help fund these games; notes that Scotland stands to lose out on lottery revenues due to the 2012 Olympic Games being held in London, but that there is no suggestion that Scots should be given an early chance to buy tickets before general public sale despite this loss of resources to Scotland, and believes that no specific area of the United Kingdom should be given the first chance to buy tickets for the London Olympics in 2012 before any other area.</p>
