          <p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-816</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Barnardo&rsquo;s and MPS Training</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the partnership work in the youth education and training field being done by Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland and social enterprise group, MPS Training, which uses innovative approaches and vocational skills training within the framework of mainstream education to re-engage young people for whom the traditional model of school education has not been suitable and who are at risk of not having the necessary skills to enter the workforce, and believes that the model used by Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland and MPS Training at its centres in Johnstone and Clydebank is one that merits consideration by the Scottish Government and more local authorities as a more widely used option for some school pupils.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-815</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>National Epilepsy Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposals brought forward by the leading Scottish charity, Quarriers, to build a national centre for excellence in the treatment of epilepsy which will be fully integrated with the Institute of Neurological Sciences at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow; welcomes the opportunity that such a centre would offer in providing world-class services to people with epilepsy, and believes that every effort should be made by both the NHS and the Scottish Government to support the proposal.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-814#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Moratorium on Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the admission by the Post Office, in response to concerns raised over the proposed post office closures in Glasgow, that &quot;If, at the end of the consultation period, a post office branch is removed from the list of proposed closures, then we would have to propose another branch for closure within this area plan.&quot; and believes that such an admission calls into question the validity of any consultation process and that, in light of these damning revelations, a moratorium on the current process should be considered.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-747.1</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Independence is the Only Solution to West Lothian Question</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-747) in the name of Jamie Hepburn, leave out from &quot;that the Conservative&quot; to end and insert &quot;the findings of the Social Attitudes Survey for 2007 which shows support for independence at only 23%, the lowest level since the survey began a decade ago; further notes that when in government the Conservative Party was content to use the votes of English MPs to push through Scotland-only legislation including for the community charge, or poll tax, and relied on the votes of Northern Irish MPs to sustain itself in government until its defeat in 1997; further notes that during previous spells of devolution in Northern Ireland until 1974 no proposal to preclude Northern Irish MPs voting at Westminster was forthcoming from the Conservative Party, and considers that the current mood in both the Conservative Party and Scottish National Party is motivated more by their inability to secure sufficient support for their policies rather than any concern for fairness.&quot;</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-735.1</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Charlotte Louise McKechnie: Young Chorister of the Year</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-735) in the name of Stuart McMillan, leave out from &quot;on winning&quot; and insert &quot;on becoming the first Scot to be named British Broadcasting Corporation Young Chorister of the Year after out-singing three other finalists from across the United Kingdom at St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, London, on Saturday 27 October 2007; notes that 15-year-old Charlotte is a choir member at Giffnock South Parish church, a choral scholar at St Bride&rsquo;s in Hyndland, a member of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra junior choir and a pupil at Glasgow&rsquo;s excellent Hutchesons&rsquo; Grammar School; further notes that Charlotte&rsquo;s performance, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 at 8 pm on Sunday 4 November 2007, illustrated just how fully deserved her outstanding victory was, and wishes her all the very best for the future.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-721.1</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Social Work Cuts Force Frail Fife Pensioners to Stay in Hospital</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-721) in the name of Helen Eadie, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that the Labour party, in control of Fife Council since its inception in 1996 until May 2007, did not face up to the financial crisis that it created within the authority; welcomes the fact that the new administration, in charge for less than six months, is taking steps to tackle the funding shortfall in many sectors; notes that this includes instigating a benefits check for elderly Fife residents which has thus far resulted in them receiving an additional &pound;1 million to which they did not know they were entitled, and wishes the new administration well in providing for all the people of Fife.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-691</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Abolition of Bridge Tolls(Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-668#</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Perceived Norms of Alcohol and Tobacco Consumption - Pilot Studies in Scottish Educational Institutions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent survey on student alcohol consumption carried out by McAlaney and McMahon in the University of Paisley and detailed in <em>Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs </em>(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?linkbar=plain&amp;db=journals&amp;term=0096-882X (2007; 68(3):385 &ndash; 392); notes that it replicates work in the United States of America that has demonstrated that most people overestimate the alcohol and tobacco intake of their peers and that this misperception of the norm leads to increased consumption; notes the authors&rsquo; statement that this raises the possibility of applying social norms interventions, as demonstrated to be effective in the USA, to the United Kingdom; further notes that pilot schemes along these lines are being undertaken in several schools in the Croydon area of England, and considers that the practicality of initiating such schemes in Scottish educational institutions should be investigated.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-612#</strong> <strong>Paul Martin:</strong> <strong>Car Parking Charges at Stobhill Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to introduce car parking charges at Stobhill Hospital later this year; recognises the impact that this proposal will have on the local community through inconsiderate parking by car commuters in residential areas surrounding the hospital; is concerned that current provision of public transport to and from Stobhill Hospital is insufficient, and considers that a new car parking policy that would remove car parking charges at Stobhill Hospital should be developed.</p>
