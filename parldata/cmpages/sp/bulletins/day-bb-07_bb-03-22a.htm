<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Executive Debate: Scotland in the United Kingdom&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-5779</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Scotland in the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the United Kingdom is a mutually beneficial relationship for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England; notes that devolution &quot;is a process, not an event&quot;; notes the additional powers that have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament since 1999; notes that the majority of people in Scotland oppose separation from the rest of the UK; believes that such a course would result in either cuts in vital public services or massive increases in taxation; believes that Scotland should retain the benefits of being part of the UK, and notes the respective positions of the Labour and the Liberal Democrat parties on the powers of the Parliament. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S2M-5779.2</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: Scotland in the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;United Kingdom&quot; to end and insert &quot;current constitutional arrangements do not offer the right solutions to the challenges facing Scotland, that the natural state of independence, enjoyed by our most successful neighbours, offers the best opportunities for Scotland and that the people of Scotland should have an opportunity in a referendum within the next four years to make their own decision on whether or not Scotland should be independent.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S2M-5779.3</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Scotland in the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;, and notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;whilst, where appropriate, increasing the powers available to the Scottish Parliament.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S2M-5779.4</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie: Scotland in the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;the United Kingdom&quot; to end and insert &quot;all political parties receive electoral support from people with a range of views on the constitution; considers therefore that the constitutional future of Scotland is a matter best decided by the people of Scotland through a referendum; believes that, regardless of the constitutional future chosen by the people of Scotland, there is a strong case for devolving power from government to local communities throughout Scotland, and considers that government in Scotland, whether under the current devolved arrangements or in an independent future, can do far more to empower communities than has been done to date.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S2M-5779.1</strong> <strong>Colin Fox: Scotland in the United Kingdom</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;is a mutually beneficial relationship&quot; to end and insert&nbsp;&quot;thwarts Scotland&rsquo;s economic, social, cultural and political development; believes that Scotland would be better off if it were independent from the UK; believes that an independent Scotland would remove Trident nuclear weapons from the Clyde, scrap the hated council tax and prescription charges and redistribute the great wealth of Scotland to address widening inequalities and would never have agreed to send Scottish soldiers to fight a war in Iraq that is considered by many to be illegal; believes that Scots have the same democratic rights to self-determination as the people of any other country, and looks forward to a Scotland that is independent, socially just and internationalist in its outlook.&quot; </p>
