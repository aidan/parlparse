            at 650 in Scotland, and the need to encourage greater recruitment; 
            recognises the excellent work done by the Fostering Network in highlighting 
            the problems facing foster children and their carers and the work 
            they do in conjunction with local authorities to improve the prospects 
            for both the children in need of foster care and those who wish to 
            foster, and accordingly urges the Scottish Executive, as part of its 
            ongoing work with the Fostering Network, to provide practical assistance 
            in publicising and promoting recruitment in this most important vocation.</P>

            notes the commencement of the World Schools Debating Championship 
            in Stuttgart from 11 to 21 February 2004; further notes that Scotland 
            has won the competition on two previous occasions; takes the opportunity 
            to wish the Scottish team of Anna Crosby, Yoosun Koh, Nathan Smeaton, 
            James Moir and Gabriel Brady the very best of luck in attempting to 
            bring the competition back to Scotland for a third time; believes

            Highland</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the important role 
            that radio news provides in disseminating regional news and current 
            affairs; regrets that in 1992 the BBC decided to discontinue BBC Highland, 
            the English language news and current affairs service that provided 
            vital regional coverage throughout the Highlands and Islands; notes 
            that the decision was strongly opposed by the wider community at the 
            time, and calls on the BBC, as part of its duty to provide a comprehensive 
            broadcasting service across the whole of the UK, to reinstate the

          <p><strong>*S2M-895#</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Missing 
            Link Completion and Upgrade of the A801 Avon Gorge Road</strong>-That 
            the Parliament acknowledges the tireless campaigning efforts over 
            many decades by local communities and individuals of Westfield and 
            Avonbridge to bring about the much-needed upgrading of the A801 Avon 
            Gorge road; notes with concern the significant number of deaths and 
            accidents on the road over the years; recognises that the road is 
            a key link between the M8 and M9 in the very centre of Scotland and 
            that completion of the missing link part of the road would allow safe 
            and more environmentally responsible north-south transportation in 
            Scotland, avoiding one of the most severe gradients, of approximately 
            1 in 6, of any road in Scotland and so eliminating the 40 miles currently 
            taken by many heavy goods lorries from Whitburn to Grangemouth via 
            Newbridge, and believes that the Scottish Executive should recognise 
            the important national strategic importance of improving this road 
            in considering its decision in relation to planning and should acknowledge 
            its responsibility to help complete and upgrade the road in terms 
            of support for funding to West Lothian and Falkirk councils.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-894#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Bus 
            Services for Holyrood and the New Scottish Parliament</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with dismay the removal of Lothian Buses Service 
            64 running between Holyrood and Princes Street; further notes that 
            the only remaining service, Lothian Buses Service 35 serving the Holyrood 
            and Abbeyhill areas, is a temporary service which does not operate 
            into the evenings; understands that local residents, along with staff 
            from a range of companies including Scotsman Publications, are adversely 
            affected; welcomes plans for the high frequency Lothian Buses Service 
            100 to be extended from the current service from Waverley Station; 
            notes with regret that due to the lack of an agreed route with the 
            Traffic Commissioner there will be no extension of the Lothian Buses 
            Service 100 until autumn 2004 at the earliest; notes with concern 
            the fact that there is now no direct bus route between the city centre 
            and the new Parliament at Holyrood, and considers that the relevant 
            authorities, including the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, 
            the City of Edinburgh Council and Lothian Buses, should resolve this 
            problem urgently.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-893#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses Deserve Settlement Now</strong>-That the Parliament is appalled 
            that nursery nurses, essential to the development of our children 
            and the future well-being of Scotland's society, are still not valued 
            by COSLA or the Scottish Executive; condemns those who profess to 
            support investment in education and who profess concern about Scotland's 
            depopulation, but condemn nursery nurses to low pay, undervalued status 
            and continued gender discrimination; salutes the determination and 
            solidarity of the 4000 nursery nurses on strike this week; believes 
            that the spectre of all-out strike action is an indictment of the 
            employers, COSLA and the Executive; considers that COSLA should return 
            to the negotiating table; believes that the Executive must exert all 
            its influence to ensure a fair and agreed national settlement for 
            nursery nurses, and affirms its unequivocal support for nursery nurses.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-892#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Vending 
            Machines in Schools</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the recent 
            research into vending machines in schools commissioned by the Food 
            Standards Agency and carried out by the Health Education Trust; notes 
            that this research shows that vending machines containing water, milk 
            and fruit juice are just as popular as those containing fizzy drinks 
            and that they yield a similar income for school funds, and therefore 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should take immediate steps 
            to remove fizzy drinks from vending machines within our schools in 
            favour of these healthy alternatives.</P>

            Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end 
            and insert &quot;agrees that the review of options for the long-term 
            management of radioactive waste, currently being undertaken by the 
            Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, is the correct means of 
            engaging Scotland in the debate to find a long-term publicly acceptable 
            solution to the disposal of long-lived radioactive waste and that 
            the Scottish Executive should continue to input into UK, European 
            and international radioactive waste issues and require the Scottish 
            Environment Protection Agency to implement policy such as the <em>UK 
            Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 2001-2020</em>.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-890.4</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Nuclear 
            Waste</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-890) in the name of 
            Roseanna Cunningham, insert after &quot;Parliament&quot;, &quot;acknowledges 
            that radioactive nuclear waste for which there is no safe disposal 
            route will remain harmful to human health and the environment for 
            many thousands of years and that responsibility for nuclear waste 
            created by this generation will have to be inherited by countless 
            future generations; considers that the most important step in tackling 
            the growing problem of nuclear waste must be to stop creating the 
            waste in the first instance; believes that Scotland should not accept 
            nuclear waste originating outside Scotland and that waste arising 
            from Scottish civil and military nuclear facilities should remain 
            on the site of the originating facility in secure, monitorable and 
            retrievable storage;&quot;.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-889</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>The 
            Future of Scottish Football</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            crisis faced by Scottish football; recognises football's *significant 
            contribution and potential impact* in terms of its economic, social 
            and health benefits and *its role* in our culture and identity; sympathises 
            with the backroom and playing staff of those clubs worst affected; 
            calls on professional football clubs to work with their supporters 
            to harness the emotional and financial investment they make in their 
            clubs; calls on the football authorities and clubs to ensure better 
            business planning and financial management; believes that public funding 
            for the game is essential but not the bail out of individual clubs; 
            welcomes current and proposed financial support from the Scottish 
            Executive but calls for such support to be matched by structural change; 
            calls for the Scottish Football Association (SFA) to be a more integrated 
            governing body for the game; calls for *a review of* the professional 
            league structure in Scotland and the criteria for membership, and 
            further calls for the SFA to regulate and develop participation by 
            all ages and at all levels from grassroots in the community through 
            to the national team.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-889.1</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>The 
            Future of Scottish Football</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-889) 
            in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;significant&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;importance in terms of its economic, social 
            and health benefits and also its contribution to our culture and identity; 
            believes, however, that football clubs must take responsibility for 
            their own commercial decisions and that a well-run football club should 
            be sustainable without the need for public funding; further believes 
            that the Scottish Executive can help club finances by lifting the 
            outdated alcohol ban in all-seater stadia, and invites the Scottish 
            Football Association to consider reinstating the home international 
            championship as a means of generating additional revenue for the development 
            of the game.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-889.2</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>The 
            Future of Scottish Football</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-889) 
            in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;sympathises&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;; notes the experience of successful club 
            teams such as Barcelona that are mutually owned and elect their own 
            board of directors to run the club; further notes that some clubs 
            in the English Nationwide League have already chosen this path by 
            setting up supporters' trusts, and believes that public funding should 
            be made available to allow for wider community involvement in the 
            clubs and to co-ordinate the game across Scotland.&quot;</P>
