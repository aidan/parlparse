<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4223</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Takeover of Ottakar&rsquo;s by Waterstone&rsquo;s</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the provisional decision by the Competition Commission to allow the takeover of Ottakar&rsquo;s by Waterstone&rsquo;s is misguided, ignores the distinctive nature of the Scottish book market and disregards the evidence given to the commission by the Cross Party Group on Scottish Writing and Publishing, which made clear its belief that a merger would both limit consumer choice and diminish opportunities for Scottish writers to become established, and urges the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport to lobby the Competition Commission to seek to have this decision reversed before it is made final.</p>
<p>Supported by: Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4222</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Local Electoral Administration and Registration Services (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Local Electoral Administration and Registration Services (Scotland) Bill, agrees to&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(a)&nbsp; any increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule    9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders; and</p>
  <p>(b)&nbsp; any charges or payments in relation to which paragraph 4 of that Rule applies, arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>S2M-4221</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani on behalf of the European and External Relations Committee:</strong> <strong>The European Commission&rsquo;s Work Programme 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the European Commission&rsquo;s Legislative and Work Programme for 2006 and its importance for the work of the Parliament and its committees and to Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4220</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Caledonia Youth Funding Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the funding cuts to Caledonia Youth in Dundee; understands that Caledonia Youth provides sexual health education and advice to Dundee&rsquo;s youths and vulnerable adults; notes that in 2003-04 Dundee recorded the highest rate of teenage pregnancy at 64.4 per 1,000 against the national average of 42.4 per 1,000; recognises the excellent work carried out by the Corner Project, but believes that Dundee requires more, not fewer, services to tackle its teenage pregnancy problems; further notes that the closure of this facility will not only mean that Tayside will be losing five highly skilled professionals but that the young people who rely on this service will be missing out on much needed support, and calls on NHS Tayside to reconsider this decision.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4219</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie on behalf of the Procedures Committee:</strong> <strong>Procedures relating to Crown Appointments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Procedures Committee&rsquo;s 2nd Report 2006 (Session 2), <em>Procedures relating to Crown appointments</em> (SP Paper 515); endorses its conclusions and recommendations, and agrees that the changes to Standing Orders set out in Annexe A to the report be made with effect from 20 April 2006.</p>
<p>Supported by: Karen Gillon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>S2M-4218</strong> <strong>Brian Adam on behalf of the Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Bill Committee:</strong> <strong>Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Interests of Members of the Scottish Parliament Bill be passed.</p>
<p> <strong>S2M-4216</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>The Spiralling Cost of the Nuclear Clean-Up</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great concern the news that the clean-up cost for existing nuclear facilities is set to rise by &pound;14 billion to &pound;70 billion; believes that this highlights that nuclear power is expensive as well as dangerous and dirty; considers that Scotland has no need for new nuclear power stations which, according to the UK Government-appointed Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, if built, would produce radioactive waste nine times stronger than currently exists and will cost billions of pounds to both build and clean up, and also believes that we should reject Labour&rsquo;s nuclear ambitions, while promoting clean and safe energy technologies with which Scotland has the potential to lead the world.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4178&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Unchecked Spiral in Land Prices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that prices paid for Scottish estates have outperformed stock market values over the past 25 years; also notes that property prices for farms, houses and flats have risen in consequence of spiralling land prices, with especially negative effects in the Highlands and Islands, so that new entrants to farming and potential house buyers cannot relate the prices being asked to the income and wages which they can realistically hope to earn; regrets the lack of a land value tax in Scotland to correct the inflation of unearned increases in land prices; therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should bring forward a scheme for land value tax; recalls that this was not dismissed but merely postponed in the first range of land reform proposals until adequate research had been conducted, and believes that the Executive should ensure that Scots have a realistic opportunity to access affordable land for both homes and business development in their own country.</p>
