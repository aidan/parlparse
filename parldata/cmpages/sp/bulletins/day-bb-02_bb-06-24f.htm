          <p><strong>*S1M-3243</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson: Scottish Men's 
            Lacrosse Team</strong>-That the Parliament wishes every success to 
            the Scottish Men's Lacrosse Team at the World Cup Competition in Perth, 
            Australia; notes that the team has received no support from <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
            in achieving this, and recommends that men's lacrosse in Scotland 
            has a separate association from women's lacrosse.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3242</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Scottish Place 
            Names Survey</strong>-That the Parliament commends the excellent work 
            undertaken by the Scottish Place Names Survey and by Ian Fraser who 
            retired in Autumn 2001; notes that the discipline of place name studies 
            is of great benefit to a nation, particularly one that has three indigenous 
            languages and whose place names are influenced by no less than six 
            languages, more than in any other European country; accepts that state 
            funding for the discipline is the norm in most European countries 
            and that place name studies contribute valuable assistance to national 
            and local government and to individuals in matters such as sourcing 
            derivations of place names, suggesting appropriate names for new developments, 
            and preserving our cultural and linguistic heritage; agrees with the 
            Principal of the University of Edinburgh that state funding could 
            be expected for the survey while regretting that continued funding 
            by the University is no longer possible, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to provide appropriate financial assistance to the Scottish 
            Place Names Survey to allow it to proceed with the next phase of the 
            Scottish Place Names Database and offer a service to enquirers.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr George Reid<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3241</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Dog Fouling 
            (Scotland) Bill - Stage 1</strong>-That the Parliament agrees to the 
            general principles of the Dog Fouling (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3240#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Health in Developing 
            Countries</strong>-That the Parliament encourages academic researchers 
            and drug companies in Scotland to give a higher priority to developing 
            medicines which will promote better health and nutrition in developing 
            countries and considers that the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's 
            Government should introduce inducements to progress along these lines.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3239</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Aberdeen Council Housing 
            Stock</strong>-That the Parliament notes that over the last four years 
            more than £3 million of public money and tenants' rents has been spent 
            by Aberdeen City Council in investigating stock transfer; further 
            notes that after only a few months the tenants' representatives on 
            the Council Housing Options Working Group (CHOWG) rejected wholesale 
            stock transfer and repeated that rejection in the recent survey, and 
            calls on Aberdeen City Council to endorse the views of the tenants 
            without any further cost to the rents such as an expensive ballot.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3238</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Congratulations 
            to Gretna Football Club</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Gretna Football Club on its election to the Third Division of the 
            Scottish Football League; recognises the importance of football in 
            all parts of Scotland; welcomes the fact that the inclusion of Gretna 
            Football Club continues the trend of the football league towards a 
            wider geographic spread of member clubs, and wishes the team, its 
            manager, supporters and everybody else associated with the club well 
            in their endeavours in the new and future seasons.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3237</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Police Reform 
            Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament endorses the principle 
            that sex offenders orders made in one jurisdiction within the United 
            Kingdom should be recognised and enforceable throughout the UK with 
            appropriate provisions in place concerning how the orders are applied 
            for, amended and discharged, and agrees that the relevant provisions 
            to achieve these ends should be considered by the UK Parliament in 
            the Police Reform Bill.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dr Richard Simpson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3236</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Water Environment 
            and Water Services (Scotland) Bill - Stage 1</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees to the general principles of the Water Environment and Water 
            Services (Scotland) Bill. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Andy Kerr, Iain Gray, Allan Wilson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3227</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Local Government 
            in Scotland Bill - Financial Resolution</strong>-That the Parliament, 
            for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from 
            the Local Government in Scotland Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure 
            payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the

          <p><strong>S1M-3226</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Legal Aid in 
            Peeblesshire</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that 
            there is no local access to legal aid in Tweeddale, the last legal 
            aid practitioner having recently left practice in Peebles; is concerned 
            that this, combined with the current closure of Peebles Sheriff Court 
            and uncertainty over its future, must prejudice access to justice 
            by the people of Peeblesshire, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive 
            to address these deficiencies as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3225 Des McNulty on behalf of the Finance Committee: 
            3rd Report of the Finance Committee 2002</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the 3rd Report 2002 of the Finance Committee, <em>Stage 1 of 
            the 2003/04 Budget Process</em> (SP Paper 597) and refers the recommendations 
            to the Scottish Executive for consideration. </p>

            campaign by <em>The Press and Journal</em> against the 10% tax imposed 
            by Her Majesty's Government on oil and gas profits; agrees that the 
            tax and the way in which it was introduced pose a threat to jobs throughout 
            Scotland, especially in the north east, as well as to the considerable 
            efforts that were underway to prolong the life of the North Sea province, 
            and believes that the campaign deserves cross-party support and the 
            express support of the Scottish Executive.</p>

            and intends to make his conclusion public soon; further notes that 
            the retention of the sheriff court at Peebles is supported by, <em>inter 
            alia,</em> the Sheriff Principal of Lothian and Borders, the two sheriffs 
            who sit there, the Society of Solicitors in the Shires of Selkirk

          <p> <strong>S1M-3173#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Loan Sharks</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">commends the excellent initiative 
            of the <em>Daily Record </em>to name and shame the "loan sharks" who 
            prey on vulnerable people living in poverty throughout Scotland; agrees 
            with the newspaper that Scotland must not be a country where it is 
            a crime to be poor and where loan sharks obtain huge profits out of 
            other people's precarious financial circumstances, and is of the firm 
            view that the Parliament, in close partnership with the UK Parliament, 
            the police and other appropriate public agencies, must take decisive 
            action to drive these predators out of their sordid "business" in 
            the interests of their victims and victims' families.</a></p>
