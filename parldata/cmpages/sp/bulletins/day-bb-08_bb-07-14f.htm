<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2325</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to ACE IT on Winning Nominet Best Practice Challenge Award 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Age Concern Edinburgh Information Technology (ACE IT) on winning the Nominet Best Practice Challenge Award 2008, designed to celebrate achievement and innovation within the internet industry and to recognise those organisations, groups or individuals which have embraced the challenge of making the internet a secure, open, accessible or diverse experience for all; notes the sterling work of ACE IT since 2001 in training more than 3,000 people aged over 50 in IT skills from its base in the Gorgie/Dalry area of Edinburgh as well as its several resulting projects, delivered with a range of partners including the &quot;Edinburgh Silver Surfers&quot; initiative, in which members create their own websites of views and reviews of interest to older people, and the &quot;Moose in the Hoose&quot; initiative, designed to introduce the benefit of computers and the internet to those living in care homes and sheltered housing across Edinburgh; believes that the work of ACE IT provides a shining example of good practice to the rest of Scotland, the United Kingdom and beyond in helping to ensure that technological developments can be harnessed and enjoyed by all sections of society, and further notes that, as winners, ACE IT will now also be promoted as demonstrations of best practice to industry, government, academia and in the media both in the UK and internationally as well as being invited to take a leading role in the UK preparatory meeting for the Internet Governance Forum in India.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2324</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to ACE IT on Winning the Nominet Best Practice Challenge Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Age Concern Edinburgh Information Technology (ACE IT) on winning the prestigious Nominet Best Practice Challenge Award 2008; recognises the excellent work that ACE IT does in introducing Edinburgh&rsquo;s older generation to information and computer technology, and wishes the project all the best in the future, both in its continued work in Edinburgh and as a showcase representative for the United Kingdom at the next Internet Governance Forum in December 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2323</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>World Heritage Status for the Antonine Wall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the UN cultural body, Unesco, to make the Antonine Wall, which was the most northerly point in the Roman Empire, a World Heritage Site; notes that the wall stretches for 37 miles across the central belt of Scotland from Bo&rsquo;ness, near Falkirk, to Old Kilpatrick in West Dunbartonshire; looks forward to the boost to the local economy and tourism in the area and specifically for the communities of Cumbernauld, Falkirk, Bo&rsquo;ness and Kirkintilloch located along the wall, and congratulates Historic Scotland, East and West Dunbartonshire councils, Falkirk Council, Glasgow City Council and North Lanarkshire Council on the successful campaign to have the significance of the landmark fully recognised and accorded world heritage status.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2322</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Fife Fabrications</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Fife Fabrications Limited and all involved in its recent success at the Subcon Exhibition in Birmingham; notes that the Glenrothes-based company received two awards at the event, Best Subcontractor and Best Health, Safety and Environmental Practice; recognises that the company was also runner-up for the overall award for excellence and engineering; hopes that it will continue to grow and prosper as a world-class manufacturer, and pays tribute to the skilled workforce and management.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2321</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Health Commission for Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of the Health Commission for Glasgow as providing an important element of a major push against health inequalities in the city; notes that the commission will form a key part of Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s efforts to ensure the 2014 Commonwealth Games leave a lasting legacy for the people of Glasgow, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide all necessary support to the commission in developing and implementing plans to promote greater equality in health.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2320</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Government Plans May Lead to Ghettoisation of Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the implementation and consequences of the UK Government&rsquo;s local housing allowance (LHA), which has replaced housing benefit, highlighted by growing evidence in Glasgow that landlords and letting agents are not receiving rent from clients on benefits leading to these clients being refused private rented accommodation; considers that this is a direct consequence of the allowance being paid directly to claimants rather than landlords and gives rise to concerns that this could result in the repossession of property and a huge rise in the number of homeless people; notes the concerns raised that this could lead to increased ghettoisation in Glasgow as people are forced out of more expensive areas and into poorer ones due to the introduction of the flawed broad rental market areas, and believes that the LHA must be reformed as a matter of urgency before these changes irreversibly damage Glasgow&rsquo;s drive to build mixed communities.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2319</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>&quot;Bring It On!&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent &quot;Bring It On!&quot; event held in Glasgow for over 500 teenagers from nine different secondary schools, aimed at educating pupils about the dangers of street violence, gang-related violence, drugs, alcohol and personal safety in a relaxed and informal setting; notes that similar initiatives, such as &quot;Operation Reclaim&quot; and specific behavioural change workshops, have aided in reducing the crime rate in the east end of Glasgow by up to 24% since October 2007, and hopes that these significant achievements will be welcomed by all.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2318</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Carers Allowance, Minimum Income Standard and Earnings Rule</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern that the Carers&rsquo; Allowance of &pound;50.55 per week falls far short of the minimum income standard of &pound;158 per week for a single working-age adult recommended in the Joseph Rowntree Foundation research report, <em>A minimum income standard for Britain: What people think</em>, and represents less than one-third of what is considered to be a socially-acceptable standard of living; expresses further concern that the carers&rsquo; allowance is not paid at all to anyone earning only &pound;95 or above per week, and notes that these are issues that need to be reformed in the near term.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2317</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>K&rsquo;Nex Challenge Regional Finalists</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates two P5 girls from Lochgelly South Primary School, Kayleigh and Lindy, on going through to the Scottish south-east regional final of the annual K&rsquo;Nex Challenge, having won two previous rounds by making a K&rsquo;Nex model according to a set of instructions given on the day; applauds the initiative, organised across Scotland by SETPOINT Scotland, that encourages primary school children with an interest in design and engineering by inspiring them to use K&rsquo;Nex to produce a design solution for an engineering problem, and hopes that Lochgelly South Primary School&rsquo;s staff will continue to support their very talented pupils to achieve further success in future competitions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2316</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Scottish Enterprise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns Scottish Enterprise for failing to fulfil previous commitments to fund regeneration projects, including &pound;600,000 towards the &pound;1.6 million scheme at the West Sands, St Andrews; believes that Scottish Enterprise should honour these commitments, and urges Scottish ministers either to instruct Scottish Enterprise to honour these commitments or to directly transfer the relevant funds from Scottish Enterprise to the appropriate local authorities.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2315</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Antonine Wall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by UNESCO to award the Antonine Wall world heritage status, recognising it as an important historical link between Scotland and the Roman Empire, and further welcomes the boost to tourism and the local economies of those areas along the route of the Antonine Wall that this award represents.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2314</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Antonine Wall - World Heritage Site</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the categorisation of the Antonine Wall as a world heritage site by Unesco; congratulates everyone involved in securing the prestigious accolade for Scotland, and encourages all partner organisations, businesses and individuals to work together to ensure that the social and economic benefits of the title, World Heritage Site, for the Antonine Wall are shared by the whole of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2313</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Antonine Wall - A World Heritage Site</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the confirmation of the Antonine Wall&rsquo;s status as a world heritage site; congratulates all those who have contributed to this achievement, including Historic Scotland, campaigners from Bo&rsquo;ness to Old Kilpatrick, Falkirk Council and other local authorities, the Scottish Executive past and present and the UK Government; notes that this will focus international attention on the area, helping to promote tourism and increase awareness of Scotland&rsquo;s Roman heritage, and looks forward to a continuing partnership approach to ensure the preservation, study and development of educational and tourist resources highlighting the global importance of Scotland&rsquo;s heritage.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2311</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>East Renfrewshire Council&rsquo;s Proposals for Braidbar Quarry, Huntly Park and Lower Huntly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the predicament of East Renfrewshire homeowners whose properties are blighted by their proximity to the disused Braidbar Quarry; further notes the growing fear amongst the local community that East Renfrewshire Council&rsquo;s current proposal to shore up the ground adjacent to these properties may lead to much-loved green spaces Huntly Park and Lower Huntly being substantially compromised and that the associated development of new housing will inevitably place an additional demand on local amenities that are already widely regarded as being overstretched, and calls on East Renfrewshire Council to investigate an alternative proposal that meets both the needs of affected homeowners and the concerns of the wider Braidbar residential community by guaranteeing that Huntly Park and Lower Huntly are not only preserved but enhanced by any development and that additional demands on local amenities and infrastructures resulting from any new houses are met with sufficient investment and redevelopment to meet that demand.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2310</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Irrelevance of the Liberal Democrats</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the utter irrelevance of the Liberal Democrats; believes that they are the architects of their own increasing marginalisation by their refusal to recognise the changing landscape of Scottish politics, which has shown that minority government can work and that their status as kingmakers to the largest party is now redundant; notes the unexpected vacancy for position of Scottish Liberal Democrat leader; considers that there has been a continued decline in Liberal Democrat fortunes in opinion polls, council and by-elections across the United Kingdom, and is saddened that they are still misguided enough in considering that their party is a credible force in Scottish politics.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2309</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Proposal for a Glasgow Museum of Industry, Science and Technology</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposal by the Clyde Heritage Trust to set up a museum of industry, science and technology in Glasgow based in the former Howden engineering works in Scotland Street, incorporating the world&rsquo;s only Subway power station, built in 1886; agrees that such a museum would complement the existing museums in the Glasgow area by concentrating on Scotland&rsquo;s rich history of industry, engineering and technology and focusing on large-scale working exhibits; recognises that the two unique listed buildings comprising the works would be an excellent site for this enterprise, requiring no major structural alterations and providing ease of access to disabled visitors, and notes that Scotland Street School Museum would benefit from the location of such a museum nearby and that this excellent project has the potential to create employment and provide a unique opportunity for Scotland to celebrate and preserve its industrial heritage.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2308</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Women&rsquo;s Library</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow Women&rsquo;s Library on its successful bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has agreed to provide a grant of &pound;410,000 for the creation of a dedicated archive space at the Mitchell Library and the recruitment of a full-time archivist; recognises that the bid was of a very high standard and attracted 110 letters of support; believes that the work of Glasgow Women&rsquo;s Library, which includes redressing the neglect of women&rsquo;s historical and cultural contributions to Scottish society and creating new approaches to culture and heritage that bring together women from the most diverse backgrounds, is of immense value to Glasgow and to Scotland, and offers everyone at the Glasgow Women&rsquo;s Library the very best wishes as they take this significant step forward in the development of their service.</p>
