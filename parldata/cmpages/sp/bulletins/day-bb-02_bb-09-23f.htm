            teachers who, through their hard work and enthusiasm, are making the 
            programme a success across Scotland; hopes that more schools will 
            register an interest in the project, and considers that the Executive

            citizenship and environmental awareness.</p>

            that resources are to be made available to make possible the construction 
            and completion of a Glasgow Airport rail link; recognises the significance 
            of this rail link as part of a modern, 21st century transport infrastructure 
            for the whole of Scotland; believes that the most sensible option 
            for this new rail link is one routed via Paisley Gilmour Street and 
            Paisley St James, and considers that the Minister for Enterprise, 
            Transport and Lifelong Learning should announce, as a matter of urgency, 
            both his favoured option for this development and a clear timetable 
            for its speedy implementation.</p>

            rail link opening up links to the airport not only from Glasgow city 
            centre but also improving accessibility from the entire country, and 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should immediately make the 
            resources available and announce as a matter of urgency the earliest 
            possible commencement date for work on the implementation of the Glasgow 
            Airport link and the Glasgow CrossRail scheme.&quot;</a></p>

            for the European Capital of Culture in 2008; further notes that Inverness 
            Highland 2008 is the sole Scottish bid; recognises the imaginative 
            plans that the bid team have proposed including capitalising on the 
            Highlands' unique culture and the development of a cultural plan; 
            further recognises the immense economic, social and cultural benefits 
            that a successful bid would bring to Inverness and the Highlands, 
            and considers that, as this is the sole Scottish bid, the Scottish 
            Executive, MSPs, government agencies and the wider Scottish society 
            should do all in their power to support the bid and promote a successful

            reach its capacity in 2003; recognises the station's significance 
            as part of the historic core of Scotland's capital city and its potential 
            as a modern, accessible transport interchange; further welcomes proposals 
            to upgrade the station to enable the significant expansion of rail 
            provision on the east coast, and encourages the Scottish Executive 
            to continue to work in partnership with Her Majesty's Government,

            their outstanding efforts in regenerating their community over the 
            last few years; notes that Whitfield, like many other parts of Scotland, 
            has its fair share of problems but recognises the great progress made 
            by community-based organisations; however, further notes the Save 
            the Children report, <em>The Well-being of Children in the UK</em>, 
            that highlights the persistence of poverty and other problems in parts 
            of the estate; regrets that the Whitfield Partnership was wound up 
            by the Scotland Office without a proper exit strategy, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government should redouble 
            their efforts to eradicate child poverty from Whitfield and every 
            other community in Scotland. </p>

            as a steadfast campaigner for recognition of the links between poverty

            pioneering work comprised in the report, <em>Inequalities in Health</em>, 
            which provided evidence that at every important stage of life people 
            of the lowest incomes suffered disproportionately from ill-health 
            and premature death; extends its thanks for his work to build a better 
            future, and extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to Sir Douglas'

            further welcomes the initiative by the council in bringing together 
            all the major faiths in the city to launch the &quot;Forum of Faiths&quot;
