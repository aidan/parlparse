<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4756</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Glasgow - Favourite UK City</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that Glasgow has been voted Favourite UK City 2006 by readers of leading lifestyle magazine, <em>Cond&eacute; Nast Traveller</em>; believes that this award is testament to the great efforts of all those who have worked so hard to counter mistaken stereotypes of the city, especially those involved in the Glasgow - Scotland with Style campaign; supports comments made by Alex Mosson, Chairman of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, that &quot;this demonstrates a real vote of confidence in Glasgow as a vibrant, cosmopolitan and stylish destination&quot;, and hopes that Glasgow will continue to build on its growing reputation as a great city for people to visit.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4755</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Education First</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the priority given to improving education standards by the Scottish Executive and the achievements delivered by schools, local authorities and other partners in taking forward the comprehensive modernisation of our schools and ensuring that Scotland&rsquo;s education system is amongst the best in the world; recognises that the Executive&rsquo;s investment in new and refurbished schools, increased teacher numbers, reducing class sizes, strong parental involvement, stable industrial relations and more targeted support for children with additional support needs is providing the right environment for real and lasting change for Scotland&rsquo;s children; believes that the education of all Scotland&rsquo;s children and young people is fundamental to securing a more productive, integrated and successful Scotland in which all our young people can compete in a global economy and all our 16 to 19-year-olds are in education, employment or training, and calls on all those in the Parliament to focus on Scotland&rsquo;s future and put the education of our children before divisive arguments about separating Scotland from the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robert Brown<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4754</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Solidarity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern with reference to&nbsp;the remarks made by Jack McConnell MSP about&nbsp;relocation of public sector jobs from Edinburgh; agrees with Eddie&nbsp;Reilly, Scottish&nbsp;Secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), when he states&nbsp;that the relocation cannot work if it is based on reducing the complement of civil and public servants; believes that co-operation on relocation will not be achieved by redundancies and undermining job security; further believes that workers in one area of Scotland should not&nbsp;suffer because of the policy of establishing new jobs in another area; considers that the Scottish&nbsp;Executive should commit to trying to achieve job relocation&nbsp;only with the agreement of the workforce and unions and without redundancies,&nbsp;and offers full support and solidarity to the workers and the PCS.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4753</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Transport and Works (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1 be completed by 24 November 2006.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4751</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1 be completed by 15 December 2006.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4750</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Statue of James Clerk Maxwell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Royal Society of Edinburgh&rsquo;s plans for a statue of James Clerk Maxwell in Edinburgh; commends it for its suggestion that the Parliament could provide an ideal site for such a statue; notes that the society does not seek public funding for the project, only a suitable location, and considers a site within the Parliament&rsquo;s precincts to be an ideal venue for such a statue.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4749</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Thomson&rsquo;s Closure of Glasgow Call Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announced closure of its Glasgow call centre by Thomson Holidays, owned by German multi-national TUI; condemns the devastating impact which this has on the lives and livelihoods of 450 workers and their families; condemns the total lack of consultation by the company with the workforce or trade unions, a reminder of the appalling lack of legal protection for Scottish workers, making them among the easiest sacked in Europe; considers this to be an outrageous theft of taxpayers&rsquo; money, including &pound;1.4 million in Regional Selective Assistance funding from the Scottish Executive, and condemns it accordingly; offers full solidarity to the Thomson workers in any action they take against closure; demands that Thomson&rsquo;s assets be confiscated, including the return of the full &pound;1.4 million in public funding for their private profiteering, and supports calls for legislation that would defend the rights of workers against such instant dismissal without the right of full prior negotiations with elected trade union representatives.</p>
<p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4748</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Committee Remit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the remit of the Communities Committee be amended to&mdash;</p>
<p>To consider and report on matters relating to housing and area regeneration, poverty, voluntary sector issues and charity law; matters relating to the land use planning system and building standards; such other matters as fall within the responsibility of the Minister for Communities; and health promotion and nutrition in schools.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4747</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Rule 9.6.3A</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees under Rule 9.6.3A that the Parliament shall consider the general principles of the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Bill on the fourth sitting day after the publication of the lead committee report.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4746.1</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>Future of Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4746) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to &quot;four years&quot; and insert &quot;notes that since devolution the gap between the poor and the rich has widened, waiting lists and times are going up, crime is getting worse, council tax has increased by 60% and economic growth is lagging behind England; recognises that these problems are not the fault of devolution, but are the fault of the Labour and Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive; believes that, to make devolution work, more power and responsibility need to be returned to people and local communities, real public sector reform needs to be instigated and better value for money needs to be provided;&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4746.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Future of Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4746) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;and agrees with its assessment that many key economic drivers are outwith the influence of devolved government and that as a devolved nation Scotland may find it increasingly difficult to assert influence within an enlarged European Union; considers that Scotland needs an ambitious government that will tackle barriers to individual fulfilment, such as child poverty and educational under-achievement, rising graduate debt, the unfairness of the council tax and the burden of rates on small businesses; further considers that a new Scottish government must be ready to fight Scotland&rsquo;s corner on issues such as Trident and nuclear power and not run for cover, like the current one, when matters of UK foreign policy require to be challenged, and believes that, to create a competitive, growing economy that will generate wealth, boost employment and raise living standards for all, Scotland badly needs the same powers of independence that other countries take for granted.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4746.3</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Future of Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4746) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out  from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges that ensuring a sustainable future for Scotland is the central responsibility of government and that none of the elements of sustainability: social justice, economic progress and environmental protection, can be viewed in isolation; rejects the concept that sustainable development simply means business as usual with a symbolic &quot;green thread&quot; running through it; accepts that the development of a truly sustainable Scotland requires a fundamental reassessment of our current needs within the context of increasingly pressing environmental limits and a recognition that the current inequalities of wealth and power within Scotland must be challenged; notes that our current economy, based as it is on the profligate consumption of fossil fuels and other finite resources, can never be described as sustainable and that a just transition to a low-carbon economy is imperative for social, environmental and economic reasons; believes that Scotland is well placed to make such a transition and to develop a society characterised by social justice, respect for environmental limits and an economy fit for the long-term future, and calls on MSPs from all parties to act now for all our futures instead of for short-term political gain.&quot;</p>
