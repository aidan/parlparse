          <p><strong>*S2M-305#</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>The 
            Crisis Facing Scotland's Fishing Communities</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament recognises the gravity of the current crisis facing Scotland's 
            fishing communities, particularly in view of the latest decommissioning 
            figures and the likelihood of even more draconian cutbacks in whitefish 
            catching effort, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            seek an immediate revision of cod quota regulations by the EU Fisheries 
            Council.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-304</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Banking 
            Facilities at Post Offices</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes 
            that all those who currently receive pension payments, tax credit 
            and benefits through the Post Office should be able to continue to 
            do so; considers that the Communications Workers Union &quot;Banking 
            on You&quot; campaign highlights the need to better publicise the 
            banking facilities that Post Offices now offer; further considers 
            that access to the Post Office Card Account should be made easier, 
            and believes that all major banks including HSBC, HBOS, Royal Bank 
            of Scotland and Natwest should be urged to sign up to universal banking 
            by making all current accounts available at Post Offices.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-303#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Natural Heritage</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the Scottish 
            Executive's policy on the relocation of public sector jobs as announced 
            by the then First Minister on 15 September 1999 and notes in particular 
            that the policy states that decisions on location should promote efficiency 
            and effectiveness, that organisations&nbsp;should be close to the 
            communities they serve and that decisions should take into account 
            costs, operational effectiveness and the position of staff concerned; 
            notes that widespread concerns have been raised regarding the decision 
            to relocate Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) headquarters from Edinburgh 
            to Inverness; further notes with dismay the issue of two ministerial 
            directions in relation to this move; considers therefore that the 
            Executive should work with the SNH Board and relevant trade unions 
            to avoid the imposition of compulsory redundancies and ensure that 
            the requirement in the ministerial directions for a continued SNH 
            base in Edinburgh meets the operational requirements of SNH and enables 
            SNH to continue to meet its core function of protecting Scotland&#146;s 
            natural heritage, and considers that the issue requires an independent 
            inquiry so that future lessons can be learnt.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-302</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Struan 
            Stevenson MEP's Support for the Common Fisheries Policy</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament deplores Struan Stevenson MEP's call, made in a draft 
            committee report to the European Parliament, to extend and constitutionally 
            enshrine control over the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP); believes 
            that his campaign has the potential to damage efforts to transfer 
            control over our fishing grounds to Scotland's Parliament given the 
            CFP's disastrous record; regrets that Struan Stevenson's actions undermine 
            attempts by our fishing communities to unite public and political 
            opinion behind policies that will protect their future; urges his 
            Conservative colleagues to publicly disassociate themselves from his 
            actions and demand that he withdraws the aforementioned draft report, 
            and calls on him to resign his convenership of the European Fisheries 
            Committee if he is unable to withdraw the draft report.</p>

            the team of men from Ness on the Isle of Lewis who have retuned home 
            safely from Sula Sgeir, having secured this year's harvest of guga; 
            recognises that this delicacy is enjoyed by many within the Western 
            Isles and indeed the Gaelic diaspora throughout the world; notes the 
            view of Scottish Natural Heritage that this annual harvest has no 
            adverse effect on the population of the gannet colony; extends its 
            very best wishes to the team for the future, and looks forward to 
            the continued success of this age-old tradition that will help to 
            delight the palate of Islanders at home and abroad for many years 
            to come.</p>

            attended the weekend&#146;s events; recognises the significant contribution 
            the Edinburgh Mela makes to intercultural activities, and calls on 
            the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Arts Council and the City of

            Mounds</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the protection given 
            to the Darwin Mounds; notes that this unique collection of cold water 
            coral reefs was only discovered in 1998 but has significantly advanced 
            global knowledge of coral formations; further notes that the coral, 
            located 1,000 metres below the surface of the ocean, provides food 
            and shelter to a wide range of marine species, and welcomes the commitment 
            to protecting and sustaining the marine environment upon which our

          <p> <strong>S2M-296#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Funding 
            of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the terms of the Standards in Scotland&#146;s 
            Schools etc. Act 2000 and, in particular, section 15; welcomes the 
            presumption of mainstreaming of children and young people with special 
            needs; is concerned, however<font color="#0000ff">, </font>that local 
            authorities may find<font color="#0000ff">, </font>due to circumstances 
            outwith their control, that they lack sufficient funding to comply 
            with these requirements and that children and young people with special 
            needs will therefore be disadvantaged, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should consider rucksack funding, that is the supplementary 
            funding of such children and young people centrally where the funding 
            package for all aspects of their care is above a statutory figure,

            Environment and Rural Development Committee recommends that nothing

          <p><strong>S2M-291#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Auxiliary 
            Fire Units in the Highlands</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            that auxiliary fire units play a vital role in many rural communities 
            in fighting fires and do so in conjunction with the retained fire 
            brigades; notes with concern that, following a report from Her Majesty's 
            Inspectorate of Fire Services (HMI), 32 auxiliary units face possible 
            closure; further notes that the new approach of integrated risk assessment 
            should permit the preservation of as many as possible of these auxiliary 
            units; considers that the Scottish Executive should explicitly endorse 
            the need for such units and acknowledge the essential role that they 
            play in protecting human life and property; believes that, if the 
            recommendations of the HMI report are not carefully considered and 
            auxiliary units are forced to close because of the proposed introduction 
            of compulsory access to breathing apparatus within a short timescale, 
            then human life and property may be placed at risk; believes that 
            all involved, including Highland Council, the Firemaster, HMI and 
            the Health and Safety Executive, should continue to discuss the implications 
            of the HMI report in the context of integrated risk assessment and 
            find an outcome that prevents the closure of so many of the auxiliary 
            units.</p>

            resumed whaling and proposes to slaughter 500 sei, fin and minke whales 
            over the next two years; deplores Iceland's killing of minke whales

            to the future of both the Scottish and Icelandic tourist industry, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to highlight these concerns to

            about the 52% rise in nurse vacancies since 1999 and the increase 
            in spend on agency nurses to £28 million per year; notes that nurse 
            recruitment and retention problems are not diminishing; understands 
            that nurses&#146; pay is an important part of the solution to the

            by both the Royal College of Nursing and Unison campaigns in raising 
            awareness of this; recognises that the Agenda for Change has made 
            some progress on pay and conditions, but believes that there needs 
            to be a Scottish recruitment and retention premium, as allowed by 
            the Agenda for Change deal, in order to fully address the problem 
            of nurse recruitment and retention by attracting more nurses to come

          <p><strong>S2M-106#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Scotland's 
            European Pollutant Emission Register</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the publication of the Scottish European Pollutant Emission 
            Register by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; recognises 
            that this is an important component of a strategy to deliver environmental 
            justice in Scotland; notes that all communities have a right to know 
            about chemical emissions in their environment; further notes that, 
            in the United States, the introduction of the Toxic Release Inventory 
            resulted in emission reductions of over 40%, and looks forward to 
            the rapid development and publication of a comprehensive and easily 
            accessible system that includes contextual health and environmental 
            impact information.</p>
