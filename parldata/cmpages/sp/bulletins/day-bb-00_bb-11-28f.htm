            notes with disapproval the decision of W&nbsp;H&nbsp;Smith to reintroduce 
            pornography to its stores; urges the company to reconsider its decision 
            to sell material which is not only offensive to many people but which 
            reinforces practices of exploitation and discrimination; further asserts 
            that such material does nothing to enhance society, has a corrosive 
            effect on the morality of Scotland and debases not just those who 
            are inadvertently forced into contact with it and are by the nature 
            of their employment compelled to offer it for sale, and also asserts 
            that such material demeans Scotland as a nation and that the Parliament 
            would welcome any action which would encourage the removal of such 
            filth from public display and sale.</font></p>

            the Parliament believes that it is essential for animal welfare and 
            for farmers and others who look after livestock and other animals 
            that veterinary surgeons retain the privilege to dispense prescription 
            only medicines; further believes that the abolition of the right of 
            veterinary surgeons to dispense prescription only medicines would 
            cause severe practical difficulties and create real risks that some 
            animals will not be treated thus compromising their welfare, and further 
            believes that the removal of this right would jeopardise the viability 
            of provision of care for some animals, given low commercial animal 
            values, and that the current system allows planned health visits by 
            veterinary surgeons to farms involving routine preventative and treatment 
            medicines recommended and sold by the veterinary practice so as to 
            cross-subsidise emergency illness care to individual animals at rates 
            which would otherwise not be independently viable.</font></p>

            for a project worker to deal exclusively with women over 50 years 
            of age and/or disabled women and notes that this is the first project 
            of its kind in the United Kingdom; expresses its concern at the apparent 
            increase in the abuse of older and disabled people, and believes that

            Stanislaw Kornorowski, the Polish Ambassador, is delivering the inaugural 
            annual lecture on 29 November 2000 which is being dedicated to the 
            memory of the heroic General Stanislaw Maczek; pays tribute to the

            and hopes that, through the new centre, people will honour the massive 
            wartime effort of Poles in the liberation of Europe, from the Polish
