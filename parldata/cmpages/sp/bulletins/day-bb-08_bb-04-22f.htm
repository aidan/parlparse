<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1752</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>North Glasgow 5K</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all participants in the 3rd annual North Glasgow 5K race and notes that this year&rsquo;s event attracted 2,500 entrants, the largest field to date; congratulates the organisers, North Glasgow Healthy Living Community and all their partners on this excellent event, and notes the positive contribution that it makes to promoting healthy lifestyles in the north of Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1751</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Historic Scotland and Local Authorities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the unique relationship between Historic Scotland and local authorities in the protection of the nation&rsquo;s historic environment and welcomes initiatives to modernise and simplify that relationship to the benefit of local authorities, Historic Scotland and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1750</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Lewis Windfarm Proposal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Government to recognise the loss of economic opportunity, local jobs potential and income to local communities that will result from the Lewis windfarm proposal not proceeding; notes that ministers refused the application on grounds founded on protection of the environment; urges the Scottish Government to ensure that the Western Isles receives additional capital investment and additional annual income to balance that which would have arisen from the project proceeding; further urges conservation organisations which opposed the application to invest significantly more of their assets in the Western Isles and to work with government and local people to invest in better management and enhancement of the habitat of the moorland and to ensure better interpretation, leisure opportunities for more visitors and local jobs, and urges the Scottish Government to work closely with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to secure investment in windfarm and other renewable energy proposals that they will be prepared to approve.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1749</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Carnegie College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the very good HM Inspectorate of Education report for Carnegie College, formally Lauder College; congratulates the staff and students on their attainments; acknowledges the wide range of learning programmes offered to the community by the college, including qualifications from access to degree level; notes the extension of its facilities and provision to local communities with a network of outreach centres throughout the Scottish Borders, Midlothian, West Lothian, Forth Valley and Fife, and further notes the benefits of the close links developed between the college and outside bodies.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1748</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Support for Scottish CND from James</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that this represents the 50th year of activity by Scottish CND; welcomes the support of the band James for the work of Scottish CND, and hopes that its support will make people more aware of the work of Scottish CND and encourage more to join the campaign against the replacement of the Trident nuclear weapons system by the UK Government at an estimated cost of up to &pound;100 billion.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1747</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Hamilton Accies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hamilton Academical FC on winning the Scottish First Division title and gaining promotion to the Scottish Premier League; notes that this success comes only a few years after the club was in a position where it had no home ground, was unable to pay the players wages and was punished by the Scottish Football League in a manner which many consider to be unfair, all of which put the club&rsquo;s very existence at risk; notes the efforts of Chairman, Ronnie MacDonald, and manager, Billy Reid, for turning the club&rsquo;s fortunes around, and wishes all staff, players and supporters good luck for season 2008-09.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1746#</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Adopt a Road</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to consider introducing the Adopt a Road initiative which works so successfully in Canada; notes that under such a scheme individuals, companies and voluntary groups take responsibility for a length of road, usually in the vicinity of the sponsoring group or person, from one junction to the next; is aware that, while no money changes hands, the sponsor agrees to keep the sponsored road free of litter and reasonably clean, contacting their local authority to uplift any refuse gathered having given at least 24 hours notice; notes that the scheme recognises sponsors through the provision of signs on the sponsored road designed, provided and erected by their local authority, and believes that such a scheme could be successfully piloted in Cunninghame North.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1745</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Real Nappy Week - 21 to 27 April</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Real Nappy Week 2008 and its theme Combat Climate Change; recognises that from birth to potty each baby uses between 4,000 and 6,000 nappies; notes that four-and-a-half trees are used to make the pulp for disposable nappies for one baby over a period of two-and-a-half years, that one cup of crude oil goes in to make one disposable nappy and that Fife Council spends over &pound;84,000 a year sending disposable nappies to landfill; recognises that real nappies make a contribution towards the reduction of waste going to landfill in Scotland; supports parents&rsquo; ability to make the right choice for their babies but believes that this should be an informed choice; welcomes the range of events being promoted by the Fife Real Nappy Network during Real Nappy Week, and supports the commitment of volunteer mums who help parents make informed choices about nappies, including confirming that there is not a safety pin in sight but a whole range of poppers, velcro or nifty little plastic grips to ensure a snug fit.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1744</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Arms Shipment to Zimbabwe and Interference in a Country&rsquo;s Internal Affairs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the statement by  the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (SATAWU), that it would be &quot;grossly irresponsible&quot; to allow a shipment of Chinese weapons through to Zimbabwe and that &quot;the South African government cannot be seen as propping up a military regime&quot;; applauds South African dock workers for refusing to unload the ship bearing the weapons; is in agreement with the government of China that &quot;one of the most important principles is not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries&quot; but is of the opinion that providing the present government of Zimbabwe with the means of thwarting the democratically expressed wishes of its people would constitute unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of another country and that China&rsquo;s longstanding support of Mugabe&rsquo;s brutal and anti-democratic regime also constitutes such interference; believes that the actions and statements of SATAWU and the Southern Africa Litigation Centre are representative of the wishes of the majority of the people of Zimbabwe, and calls on all governments, but particularly those of the countries of Southern Africa, to do what they can to ensure that the wishes of these people be respected and assist the peaceful transfer of power to a democratically elected government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1743</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Withdrawal of Modern Apprenticeship Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Scottish Government to withdraw Modern Apprenticeship funding for those over 20 years of age in all sectors other than construction, engineering and the automotive sector; believes that there is a continuing need to support and develop high-quality training through modern apprenticeships in other sectors; is particularly concerned at the withdrawal of funding in the important financial services sector; considers that this once again demonstrates the inadequacy of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s skills strategy; calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider this decision which will create a north-south divide, and is concerned that Scotland will be left at a disadvantage as against the rest of the United Kingdom in this sphere.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1742</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Cool Seas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), the charity dedicated to protecting our seas, shores and wildlife, on the launch of its Cool Seas Scotland project at Largs Sailing Club on 18 April 2008; notes that Cool Seas is a spectacular educational initiative, run by MCS to raise awareness of the wonderful life in Scotland&rsquo;s seas; is aware that Scotland&rsquo;s seas teem with wildlife, from basking sharks to coral reefs and leaping dolphins to colourful jellyfish; acknowledges that pollution of our seas and beaches, over-fishing and damage to fragile ecosystems remain acute, and recognises that this project will help redress the balance by educating children, families and the wider community about our seas, the wonderful wildlife that depends on them and how to help in their protection by expanding on an already successful programme of marine conservation activities in Scotland, connecting people with the rich biodiversity of Scotland&rsquo;s seas and shores.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1740#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>World Asthma Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes World Asthma Day on 6 May 2008, which will see the launch by Asthma UK of its &quot;Wish you were here?&quot; campaign to highlight the significant variation in asthma services throughout the United&nbsp;Kingdom; recognises that asthma is a major public health issue, with 400,000 people in Scotland having asthma, resulting in over a quarter of a million GP consultations and thousands of hospital admissions each year; believes that every school should have an asthma policy to ensure that children with asthma are given every opportunity to take part in normal school life, and further believes that more effective diagnosis, treatment and management to put more people in control of their asthma should be prioritised as part of a national respiratory strategy, similar to strategies being adopted in Wales and Northern Ireland, that ensures sharing of best practice and a joined-up approach to respiratory conditions across Scotland.</p>
