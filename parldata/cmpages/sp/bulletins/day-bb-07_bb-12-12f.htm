<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1019</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Undermining Development: Copper Mining in Zambia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates SCIAF, Christian Aid and Action for Southern Africa (ACTSA) on the publication of <em>Undermining Development: Copper Mining in Zambia</em> which focuses on Zambia&rsquo;s largest copper mining company, KCM, which is majority-owned by UK-based Vedanta Resources; notes with concern the report&rsquo;s key finding that Zambian society is deriving few of the advantages of copper mining while suffering many of the disadvantages and regrets the way in which particular companies&rsquo; operations compound this problem, and therefore calls for action to ensure that those UK corporations, particularly those which claim to be socially responsible investors, take their responsibilities seriously in ensuring that the companies in which they invest uphold best practice in terms of social and environmental responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1018</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Sport and Young People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament rejects the case for the abolition of sportscotland; notes the importance of grass-roots sport and the opportunities that currently exist to increase sporting participation and enhance sporting performance, particularly among young people, in Scotland as we look forward to the London Olympics of 2012 and the Glasgow Commonwealth Games of 2014; recognises that sportscotland has established itself as an effective arms-length body for distributing both Treasury and lottery funding as well as successfully performing important co-ordinating and strategic functions in the development of integrated sporting performance pathways, and therefore calls for sportscotland to be retained.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1017</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Civil Liberties</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the fundamental liberties enjoyed by generations of our citizens must not be eroded; welcomes the commitment by the previous Scottish Executive that ID cards would not be needed to access devolved services and its proportionate position on DNA retention; is concerned at the threat to civil liberties from the UK Government&rsquo;s expensive and unworkable proposal to introduce compulsory ID cards; believes that the Scottish Government should not put citizens&rsquo; privacy at risk by allowing the UK ID database to access personal information held by the Scottish Government, local authorities or other devolved public agencies; therefore calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that all data protection procedures are secure and that audit of data under its jurisdiction is independent of government and accountable to the Parliament, and takes the view that there should be no blanket retention of DNA samples and that the Assistant Information Commissioner for Scotland should have specific powers to carry out spot checks on the compliance by Scottish government agencies and bodies with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1016</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Black Watch Memorial</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament praises the campaign being undertaken by the Black Watch Association, in partnership with Edinburgh World Heritage, to raise &pound;15,000 to restore the Black Watch Memorial on Edinburgh&rsquo;s Mound; notes that the impressive memorial is of a kilted Black Watch soldier and commemorates the men of the Black Watch regiment who fell in the Boer War from 1899 to 1902; thanks the Bank of Scotland for donating &pound;5,000 towards the restoration of the monument, underlining the bank&rsquo;s dedication to preserving memorials to Scotland&rsquo;s fallen soldiers, and recognises the importance of protecting and restoring memorials to Scottish soldiers who have served and died in all wars.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1015</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Scottish Police Services Authority (Police Support Services) (Modification) Order 2007 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1014</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 19 December 2007</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1013</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Unsavoury Stain? Unsavoury Language</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the intemperate language used by the British Conservative leader, David Cameron MP, during his recent visit to Scotland; condemns the tone of his comments which do not reflect the democratic political realities in Scotland today; welcomes the seismic shift that the Scottish Conservatives have undergone towards supporting increased powers for the Scottish Parliament and away from this increasingly untenable union, and recognises that David Cameron&rsquo;s comments are aimed more at securing the right-wing vote in the south of England rather than winning converts in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1012</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Commemorative Stamps for the Commonwealth Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recommends to Royal Mail that a commemorative set of stamps featuring past and present Scottish sporting heroes would be a fitting tribute to Glasgow winning the race to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games; notes that the lead-in process for stamps can be up to three years, but calls on Royal Mail to fast-track this process as it did when issuing commemorative stamps for the successful London bid for the 2012 Olympics and the successful English Ashes victory in 2005.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1011</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Robbing Peter to Pay Paul</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of Save the Children&rsquo;s latest report, <em>Robbing Peter to Pay Paul</em>; expresses concern at the findings that nearly 60% of low-income families have no savings, 42% are seriously behind with bill and credit repayments and 36% have suffered penalty charges; agrees that this represents a poverty premium paid by the most vulnerable in society for access to credit and in servicing debt; expresses further concern at the conclusion that lack of access to affordable credit adversely affects children living in poverty, and urges the Scottish Government to take steps to improve access to affordable credit, such as credit unions, for those on the lowest incomes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1010</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>British Stammering Association (Scotland)</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the British Stammering Association (Scotland) (BSAS), which seeks to promote early intervention for pre-school children to prevent lifelong stammering; notes that BSAS delivered an intensive course during the 2007 summer holidays for children and young people aged 10 to 14 from across Scotland who stammer; notes its work with TAG Theatre Company on a drama project to promote confidence and self-esteem among young adults who stammer; further notes the support BSAS gives to self-help groups for people who stammer; recognises that children, young people and adults who stammer can experience teasing and bullying in education and discrimination in the workplace, and supports the continued good work of the association in campaigning on behalf of and supporting people of all ages who stammer.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1008.1</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>The Benefits of Woodland and Greenspaces</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1008) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end &quot;but recognises that these opportunities will be limited both by the risk-averse culture that has developed in Scottish schools and care establishments, based on variable local policies about risk, and by lack of investment and encouragement, until the Scottish Government creates a long-term plan to ensure that every school child in Scotland can take part in outdoor education with a requirement for school inspectors to appraise and report on access to, and use of, greenspace, and calls on ministers to start work on such a plan.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1008.2</strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>The Benefits of Woodland and Greenspaces</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1008) in the name of Michael Russell, after &quot;lives&quot; insert &quot;further recognises the economic significance of woodlands and the need to support the development and expansion of Scotland&rsquo;s commercial forestry sector&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1008.3</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>The Benefits of Woodland and Greenspaces</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1008) in the name of Michael Russell, after &quot;lives&quot; insert &quot;notes the significant revisions to SPP 11: Open Space and Physical Activity between the draft consultation and the published document, including the omission of statutory consultation on non-sporting green spaces and proposed minimum standards of open space within developments, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consult further on these significant changes to planning policy,&quot;.</p>
<p>Supported by: Karen Gillon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1008.4</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>The Benefits of Woodland and Greenspaces</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1008) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from &quot;and calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the voluntary and public sectors can work proactively to promote the use of existing woodland and other greenspace, particularly by young people, through such activities as nature kindergartens, outdoor education centres and footpath networks; recognises the importance of local authorities developing core path plans in improving public access to greenspace; further recognises the need to work with land managers to increase access to land through management contract incentives; therefore calls on the Scottish Government to commit to long-term funding to sustain better access for everyone to urban and rural woodland and greenspace through management contract incentives; calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that local authorities create better public access to their area by developing and implementing core path plans, and calls on the environmental and health sectors to work together to further develop the contribution of woodland and other greenspace to Scotland&rsquo;s health.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1001</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Reinstate our Christmas Carol Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the decision to hold a festive evening rather than a Christmas carol service in the Parliament this year; is concerned that this represents a further retreat from celebrating the traditional Christmas message; considers that, as a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ and a long-established national festival, Christmas should be explicitly celebrated annually in the Parliament, and therefore believes that the festive evening should be scrapped and the traditional Christmas service reinstated.</p>
