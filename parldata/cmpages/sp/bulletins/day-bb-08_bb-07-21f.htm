<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2340</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Time to End Discrimination Against All Unpaid Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the European Court of Justice&rsquo;s decision that the laws that protect disabled people against discrimination apply not only to the person themselves, but also to their unpaid carer; notes that this follows the historic case taken by carer, Sharon Coleman, who claimed that she was discriminated against and harassed because she had a disabled son and was treated less favourably than employees whose children were not disabled; further notes that this could give new rights to millions of unpaid carers who are struggling to combine caring with paid work, and agrees with Carers Scotland&rsquo;s view that, although this ruling appears to apply only to parents of disabled children, government should ensure that it is applied to all people providing unpaid care to others and take a proactive approach to include all carers, rather than awaiting further cases to be taken through the courts.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Cathy Peattie<strong>*</strong>, Bill Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2339</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Salmond&rsquo;s Government Has No Compassion for Disabled People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores that in the 21st century the clock is being turned back so that disabled people are apparently the least cared about by this SNP government; further deplores that all those disabled people in Scotland who now for the first time, under a Nationalist government, will face assessments of income in order to determine which scale of fees will apply for essential services that, under the previous Labour-led Scottish Executive, were provided free of charge and without any age discrimination; recognises that the age discrimination against disabled people must be investigated as a matter of urgency, and hopes that all those disabled people in the Fife region and, in particular, the towns of Lochgelly and Dalgety Bay, will act as champions supported by their local elected representatives and pursue this very important issue with every relevant agency conceivable until this disgraceful policy is reversed.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2338#</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Deserving Dignity - Children Seeking Sanctuary in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Deserving Dignity</em>, the third report from the Independent Asylum Commission, in particular the recommendations relating to the treatment of children in the asylum system; notes the commission&rsquo;s recognition of the additional support and opportunities offered to the children seeking sanctuary in Scotland, and encourages the Scottish Government to continue in its efforts to end the detention of children at the Dungavel detention centre, to work to implement the recommendations of the report and to continue in its efforts to improve the lives and opportunities of children seeking sanctuary in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2337</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Educational Seminars from Fife Constabulary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in Operation Eden, the educational seminars from police education liaison officers from Fife Constabulary and Glenrothes schools, for their success in delivering 250 seminars resulting in a substantial reduction in youth crime, and looks forward to the longer-term outcomes being evaluated and, if these indicate success, the roll out of this programme both across Fife and nationally.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2336</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>400th Stonewall Diversity Champion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the British Army on becoming the 400th Stonewall Diversity Champion, demonstrating its commitment to supporting all of its current and future employees; notes that this a remarkable achievement in light of the fact that less than 10 years ago lesbian and gay people were banned from the army; believes that the road to equality is a long one but recognises the substantial achievements of the Labour government in ensuring that equality and diversity are valued and protected at all levels of our society, and supports the UK Equality Bill which aims to make it easier for people to access their rights and be afforded the dignity and respect that they rightfully deserve.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2330</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Beauly to Denny Power Line</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, in Historic Scotland&rsquo;s consultation for an inventory of historic battlefields, responses show that the Sheriffmuir battlefield meets all the proposed criteria for the inventory, which propose that battlefields will receive the same protection as historic gardens and designed landscapes; further notes that the proposed Beauly to Denny power line passes through the centre of the Sheriffmuir battlefield; also notes that this important protective measure has come too late to be considered by the inquiry reporters, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take this into account when reaching its decision on the route and nature of the proposed power line.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2329</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Lanarkshire Children&rsquo;s Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates North and South Lanarkshire councils on beating off competition from Singapore and Daegu in South Korea to stage the International<br />

<p> <strong>*S3M-2327</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Selling Tobacco Products to Developing Countries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the marketing strategies of British American Tobacco (BAT) and other tobacco companies in promoting their products in the developing world where health concerns are already acute, health resources are overstretched and where there are far fewer restrictions on the marketing, promotion and selling of tobacco products; is aware that smoking rates in Africa, Asia and Latin America are rapidly increasing with all the appalling consequences one might anticipate; acknowledges the World Health Organization&rsquo;s research that recognises that more deaths will occur globally as a result of smoking-related diseases than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, and believes that British companies selling tobacco products overseas should market their products responsibly and avoid targeting young people unscrupulously, as they have often been accused.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2244</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Glasgow City Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow City Council on its findings that 72% of Glaswegians would be better off under local income tax as opposed to the unfair council tax, and believes that, given the persistent high levels of multiple deprivation in Glasgow under successive UK Governments, the introduction of a local income tax would contribute substantially to combating poverty in Glasgow and consequently would also combat poverty in all other areas of Scotland, both urban and rural, experiencing high levels of poverty.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2244.1</strong> <strong>James Kelly:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Glasgow City Council</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2244) in the name of Bill Kidd, leave out from  &quot;72% of Glaswegians&quot; to end and insert &quot;the proposals for a local income tax (LIT) set at 3p in the pound would lead to a funding gap for Glasgow City Council of between &pound;60 million and &pound;133 million per annum and that, accordingly, the Scottish Government would have to set the LIT at around 4.5% to avoid this gap and maintain current levels of council services, therefore hitting hard-working families; welcomes Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s findings that, because of the number of households in Glasgow in receipt of full council tax benefit, the poorest households would see no change under the LIT proposals and the problem of such households continuing to incur water and waste charges would not be resolved by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s plans, and congratulates the Labour government at Westminster since 1997 on its record of tacking social injustice and poverty, noting in particular the record employment levels, the introduction of the National Minimum Wage, which will rise to &pound;5.73, the cutting of the basic rate of income tax from 22p to 20p, the lowest for 75 years, and the introduction of tax and benefit measures, which mean that, in real terms, families with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be on average &pound;4,050 per year better off than before 1997 and that 600,000 children have been lifted out of poverty since 1997.&quot;</p>
