<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2791</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Bellshill Speaker on Remember our Heroes: Past and Present Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>Bellshill Speaker </em>newspaper on its Remember our Heroes: Past and Present Campaign, which remembers all of our service personnel who have fought for our country in the past 90 years and urges the local community in Bellshill to get behind the campaign and donate parcels for those service personnel currently serving us abroad as we approach Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2790</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>GDP&rsquo;s Inadequacy as a Measure of Sustainable Economic Growth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes and welcomes the Beyond Growth supplement in the 18 October 2008 edition of<em> New Scientist </em>magazine, which highlights the potential problems, both statistical and ecological, associated with using gross domestic product (GDP) as the major means of measuring sustainable economic growth; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s overall purpose to focus government and public services on creating a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth and its adoption of various national outcomes, indicators of progress and targets, of which the great majority do not relate to GDP; acknowledges that the previous administration was committed to reviewing the options for additional and improved ways of measuring progress, as set out in <em>Choosing our future, Scotland&rsquo;s </em>s<em>ustainable development </em>s<em>trategy</em>, and urges the Scottish Government to continue this work and broaden its methods of measuring economic progress.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2789</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Inverurie Paper Mill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the uncertainty surrounding the future of Inverurie Paper Mill following the announcement by its owner, International Paper, that it is consulting stakeholders about its future; further notes that the mill employs approximately 370 people, mostly in skilled positions, at a prime business location in Aberdeenshire, and calls on International Paper to ensure that the consultation is a genuinely inclusive process with a view to securing the best outcome for employees.</p>
