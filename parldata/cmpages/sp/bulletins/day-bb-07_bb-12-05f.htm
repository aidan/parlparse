<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-986</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Farepak</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the fact that Farepak savers have yet to receive any compensation; calls on the Westminster Government, which underwrote Northern Rock at a cost in excess of &pound;24 billion, to assist victims of the Farepak collapse, which in total would cost the comparatively much smaller sum of &pound;40 million; demands that small savers be given as much protection as big savers; acknowledges that, according to research carried out by the University of Birmingham, the majority of Farepak savers were low-paid women prudently saving for Christmas who were subsequently forced into a cycle of debt, and supports better and mandatory regulation of savings schemes and the publication of the Companies Investigations Branch report into the Farepak collapse in the interests of transparency.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-985</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>A Youth Court for Ayrshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the establishment of a youth court in Ayrshire following the success of two pilot youth courts in Hamilton and Airdrie; notes that in Hamilton and Airdrie youth offender recidivism is lower than in comparable sheriff courts, despite dealing with young people with a higher number of convictions; approves of the fast-track form of justice which ensures that young offenders are quickly brought before court, usually within 10 days of the date of the crime being committed, making them more aware of their wrongdoing; welcomes the fact that designated sheriffs, who share in the work of youth courts, provide consistent supervision of each young offender and continue to oversee the young offender&rsquo;s rehabilitation, allowing for sentences to be amended as necessary; recognises that a convicted youth remains accountable to the court for his or her actions or behaviour; acknowledges that this ongoing relationship helps to ensure that young offenders receive the most appropriate treatment and are encouraged to address offending behaviour, and believes that the high level of persistent youth offending in Ayrshire, which has risen substantially in recent years, causing misery and distress for local communities and putting law enforcement agencies under tremendous pressure, makes Ayrshire a priority for establishing a youth court.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-984</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Saint Mungo&rsquo;s Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Saint Mungo&rsquo;s Academy, Glasgow, on its upcoming 150th anniversary; further congratulates staff, pupils and parents, both past and present, for the excellent record of attainment and community involvement achieved by Saint Mungo&rsquo;s; wishes all those involved well during their anniversary celebrations, and hopes that the caring ethos of St Mungo&rsquo;s continues.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-983</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Summary Justice Reform</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that a summary justice system should deal with offending behaviour quickly and effectively; believes that the implementation of the provisions contained in the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 will help bring about improvement in how the summary justice system deals with offending behaviour; considers that the legal aid system should complement the reformed summary justice system and ensure that solicitors receive fair remuneration for their work in advising clients while also providing best value to taxpayers, and looks forward to the Justice Committee providing effective post-enactment scrutiny on the impact of the programme of summary justice reform.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-982</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Membership of the Committee of the Regions and the Regional Chamber of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposal to nominate as representatives of the Parliament Alex Neil MSP as full member and Malcolm Chisholm MSP as alternate member on the UK delegation to the regional chamber of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe, and Keith Brown MSP and Irene Oldfather MSP as full members and Alison McInnes MSP and Ted Brocklebank MSP as alternate members on the UK delegation to the Committee of the Regions for the remainder of the current session to 2010, and notes that the representation from local government to the Committee of the Regions will be Councillor Corrie McChord and Councillor Roger Knox as full members and Councillor Graham Garvie and Councillor Jim McCabe as alternate members.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-979</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Transport and Works (Scotland) Act 2007 (Consents under Enactments) Regulations 2007 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-978</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Transport and Works (Scotland) Act 2007 (Applications and Objections Procedure) Rules 2007 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-977</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Transport and Works (Scotland) Act 2007 (Inquiries and Hearings Procedure) Rules 2007 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-976</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> <strong>A New Agenda for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, recognising mainstream public opinion in Scotland, supports the establishment of an independently chaired commission to review devolution in Scotland; encourages UK Parliamentarians and parties to support this commission also and proposes that the remit of this commission should be:</p>
<p>&quot;To review the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 in the light of experience and to recommend any changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to better serve the people of Scotland, that would improve the financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament and that would continue to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom&quot;,</p>
<p>and further instructs the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to allocate appropriate resources and funding for this review.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-975#</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Clyde Independent Health Scrutiny Panel Recommendations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recommendations made by the independent Clyde Health Scrutiny Panel on proposals for health service changes in the Clyde area; notes that the panel believes that a longer and more reliable audit should be undertaken of why local mothers make the birthing choices that they are making, and agrees with the panel that community maternity units should continue to run for a further three-year period, accompanied by a positive community education programme informed by a survey of women&rsquo;s attitudes.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Sandra White<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-974</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>End the Spectre of Poll Tax</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of Citizens Advice Scotland&rsquo;s latest briefing on the community charge; expresses concern that poll tax arrears can continue to be collected in Scotland up to 20 years after they are due; recognises that, due to the length of time involved, many people in Edinburgh and across Scotland find it impossible to prove that they have paid poll tax charges that councils insist are still due; further notes that the English and Welsh system for pursuing community charge debts resulted in a six-year time limit, and calls on the Scottish Government to review the prescriptive periods for the community charge.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-973</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Dolphin Community Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Dolphin Community Centre in Tayport on successfully competing on STV&rsquo;s North Tonight programme for &pound;80,000 of funding from the Big Lottery Fund; notes the importance of the centre to the local community in and around Tayport; welcomes the funding which will be used to upgrade the building and carry out internal improvements to the layout of the centre, allowing it to be used for a greater range of activities, and wishes continued success to the centre and those who have worked so hard to secure its future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-972</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Scottish Land Girls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent report on BBC Scotland&rsquo;s Landward programme highlighting the campaign by Scottish land girls to the war effort in both the first and second world wars; pays tribute to all those who volunteered to work on Scotland&rsquo;s land to ensure that food production could continue in times of severe national shortage, and considers that the Scottish Executive should give full and proper recognition to the Scottish land girls for their contribution to the war effort.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-971</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Golf Resort Development in Aberdeen City and Shire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the decision on 29 November 2007 by the Infrastructure Committee of Aberdeenshire Council to reject Donald Trump&rsquo;s application to develop a world-class golf resort in the north east; believes that decisions of such strategic importance ought to be taken by all members of a planning authority and determined on the basis of the interests of the wider community and Scotland as a whole; calls on Aberdeenshire Council to act urgently to review and if possible reverse its decision, and calls for any appeal by the developer to be dealt with as a matter of urgency by Scottish ministers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-970#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Labour Failure to Act Against Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament shares the continuing concern of Glasgow MSPs Sandra White, Bill Kidd, Bob Doris and Bashir Ahmad at the uncertainty and distress created by the proposed post office closures in Glasgow; further notes the recent consultation presented to the Post Office and the Scottish Government on behalf of the Glasgow SNP MSPs, which found that over 99% of respondents felt that their local post office was an essential service and that they would have difficulty accessing post office facilities if their local post office closed; condemns the behaviour of the Glasgow Labour MPs for their failure to even turn up for the debate on Post Office restructuring on 29 November 2007 in the House of Commons; considers that this further compounds their earlier disingenuous stance of informing Glasgow residents that they were against the closures when in fact Glasgow Labour MPs voted in favour of recommendations for closure, and believes that the people of Glasgow have been let down by their elected representatives and that actions such as these and others by the Labour Party serve to further erode public trust and confidence in politicians.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-969</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Defence Aviation and Repair Agency Almondbank - No To Privatisation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament respects the important role played by the DARA rotary wing and components business at Almondbank near Perth which provides in-depth maintenance, repair and overhaul of components for the UK&rsquo;s military helicopter fleet; applauds the management and workforce at DARA for creating what has become a world-class centre of excellence; recognises the important role played by helicopters at the front line of modern conflicts; notes that an announcement is expected in Westminster on 15 December 2007 on the future of DARA; regrets that, far from protecting the critical work that DARA does to keep its helicopters flying, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) seems set to sell the organisation to the private sector with the sole bidder being the small Canadian company, Vector Aerospace, in a decision which would mean the permanent loss of helicopter support to the MoD and would be effectively exporting the intellectual property and design skills required to maintain operational sovereignty; welcomes the proposals submitted by the joint trade unions which, through measures such as mobile repair teams, integrating service personnel into the business, funding for capability rather than fixed pricing and directing MoD work into the business, would ensure the long-term viability and success of the business inside the MoD, and urges Baroness Taylor of Bolton, the minister responsible for the decision, to give her support to the unions&rsquo; proposals which will protect jobs, technologies and armed forces personnel.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-968</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>A New Forth Crossing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of the Forth Road Bridge to the economy of Fife and the rest of the country; notes that experts believe that the bridge could be closed to heavy goods vehicles in 2013 and all vehicles in 2019; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation exercise which explored all the possible route and build options; notes with concern the failure of the Scottish Government to announce the &quot;early go-ahead for a replacement crossing&quot; as promised in the SNP manifesto; regrets that the Scottish Government has not ruled out the possibility of tolling on the replacement crossing or has not committed to enhanced cross-Forth public transport provision, and calls on the Scottish Government to announce its plans for a replacement crossing without further delay.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-967</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Scots Trad Music Awards 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance to Scotland&rsquo;s cultural and economic life of its rich variety of traditional music; welcomes the recognition that this is given by the annual Scots Trad Music Awards which highlight the depth of talent available from across Scotland; welcomes the news that the Cullivoe Dance Band from Yell is this year&rsquo;s winner of the Scottish Dance Band of the Year award, recognising the contribution that they have made to Shetland and Scottish music over many years; further welcomes the individual award of Instrumentalist of the Year to Catriona McKay, whose contribution to Scottish music includes her membership of Shetland&rsquo;s Fiddlers&rsquo; Bid, and believes that these awards show the particular strength of Shetland&rsquo;s musical heritage which, thanks to the musical tuition available in Shetland&rsquo;s schools, is being passed on to the young Shetlanders of today, many of whom will be leading competitors for future Scots Trad Music Awards.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-966</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Human Trafficking</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of Amnesty International and Lothian and Borders Police who have joined forces to host the Slave Britain exhibition at Edinburgh Airport; hopes that this exhibition raises awareness among staff and passengers of the horrendous trade in human beings into Scotland; notes that the trafficking of human beings is hugely profitable for traffickers, is therefore rising globally and will likely continue to rise in Scotland; notes the necessity of victim support for those who have been trafficked to facilitate the prosecution of traffickers, and supports the ongoing work of the police forces throughout the United Kingdom in the detection, arrest and prosecution of traffickers who profit from this immoral and criminal trade.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-955*#*</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Music - BBC Scotland Televises Contemporary Traditional Music</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates BBC Scotland for producing the six-part series Scotland&rsquo;s Music, compiled and presented by Phil Cunningham; notes growing public acclaim for the Scotland&rsquo;s Music series as an inspiring exploration of Scotland&rsquo;s musical traditions and heritage as well as acting as a great advert for the hugely varied scenery of our country *from the Borders to the Highlands and Islands, and considers that much more urgency should be shown* in ensuring that the programme is screened throughout the United Kingdom and on worldwide channels and that the series should be available in CD and DVD formats before Christmas.</p>
