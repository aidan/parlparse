Jamieson: Flexibility and Innovation in Schools</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
is committed to raising standards in education and closing the opportunity gap; 
acknowledges that <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> encourages 
greater local flexibility for schools in delivery of the National Priorities in 
Education; welcomes the contribution made by innovative projects in the Future 
Learning and Teaching programme to addressing issues such as the transition from 
primary to SI/SII, as well as new approaches to ICT and modern languages, and 
supports the Executive in its aim of ensuring that every school is a centre of 
excellence.</P><P>Supported by: Nicol Stephen<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3535</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Decline of the Daily Record</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
regrets the decline of the <em>Daily Record</em> newspaper in relation to quality, 
honesty, objectivity and standards of reporting; notes the rapidly declining paid 
sales of the <em>Daily Record</em>; believes that this is directly related to the 
poor and unprofessional stewardship of its editors, particularly that of the current 
editor Peter Cox; recognises the sharp decline in standards and, consequently, 
in sales since the appointment of Peter Cox; further believes that his use of 
the paper to denigrate and conduct personal vendettas against individuals is both 
cowardly and unprofessional; further notes the employment record of Peter Cox, 
who was formerly assistant editor of <em>The Sun</em> newspaper between 1983 and 
1994 and who, during that time, wrote numerous articles and editorials supporting 
Mrs Thatcher and her government; notes that, during this same period, <em>The Sun</em> 
supported Mrs Thatcher&#146;s vicious war against the miners, denigrated lone 
parents regularly and referred to European citizens as &quot;krauts&quot;, &quot;wops&quot; 
and &quot;frogs&quot;; further notes that, before working for <em>The Sun</em>, 
he worked for a white South African paper under the vile apartheid regime and 
that after his eleven years at <em>The Sun</em> moved on to become deputy editor 
of the <em>New York Post</em> but only lasted five months there and was criticised 
by one executive for trying to turn the <em>New York Post</em> into an American 
version of <em>The Sun</em>; regrets the performance of Mr Cox since coming to Scotland, 
where his mistakes include denouncing a child witness as a liar the day before 
a Children&#146;s Panel hearing, for which the <em>Daily Record</em> was found guilty 
of contempt of court in 1999, and crass coverage of, for example, the heroin addiction 
of the daughter of Donald Dewar&#146;s chief of staff, the premature birth of 
Gordon and Sarah Brown&#146;s daughter and the murder of asylum seeker Firsat 
Dag, which generated widespread condemnation from across Scotland and, in particular, 
from ethnic minority communities; further notes the 70,000 a day reduction in 
sales of the <em>Daily Record</em> since Peter Cox became editor and believes that 
the language used to describe democratically elected politicians is crass, abusive 
and alien to the high journalistic standards normally associated with Scottish 
newspapers, and believes that the Trinity Mirror Group in London, owners of the 
<em>Daily Record</em>, should examine seriously the decline in standards within 
the <em>Daily Record</em> under the editorship of Peter Cox before the catastrophic 
drop in sales and journalistic standards becomes terminal.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3534</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace: Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament agrees that the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill 
be passed.</P><P>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Dr Richard 
Simpson<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Hugh Henry<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3533</STRONG>

12, each schedule being considered immediately after the section that introduces
