<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the<a href="#end"> end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5380</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Greenspace Is Good - So Prove It!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Big Lottery Fund Research Programme&rsquo;s funding of greenspace scotland&rsquo;s two-year social return on investment research programme called Greenspace is good &ndash; so prove it!; notes that this aims to enable 12 urban community greenspace groups to understand, calculate and demonstrate the impact of their projects in a way that conventional economic analysis would not, and anticipates that the project will add to the evidence, as referenced in motion S3M-05232, that green space has considerable benefits for individuals and communities such that every pound spent on developing it is returned severalfold in terms of improved health and wellbeing, reduced levels of crime, improved community cohesion etc.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5379</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, having agreed unanimously on a 42% target reduction in Scotland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and an 80% reduction by 2050, urges that all countries bring forward the most ambitious commitments appropriate to their circumstances early in the talks; looks to participants in Copenhagen to reach a legally binding agreement at the earliest opportunity that will prevent world temperatures rising by more than 2&deg;C, and notes that a failure to do so would threaten vulnerable countries with, for example, inundation and desertification.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5378</strong> <strong>Charlie Gordon:</strong> <strong>Concessionary Travel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recommendation of the <em>Review of the Scotland Wide Free Bus Travel Scheme for Older and Disabled People</em> to include seriously injured armed forces veterans to the scheme but notes with disappointment and concern the review&rsquo;s recommendation to disenfranchise disabled people who receive the lower rate of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) from the scheme; further notes that the review paints a worst-case scenario of the costs of including disabled people who receive the lower rate of DLA and that these costs are open to scrutiny and debate and that the review also played down the positive social impact that the scheme has on people&rsquo;s lives; acknowledges that denying disabled people on the lower rate of DLA access to the scheme will damage the main aims and ethos of the scheme, namely to allow disabled people improved access to services, facilities and social networks by free scheduled bus services and so promote social inclusion and improve health by promoting a more active lifestyle for disabled people; notes that previous local schemes operated in West Lothian and Strathclyde provided people on the lower rate of DLA access to concessionary travel schemes and that they supported the national scheme mirroring their eligibility criteria instead of the stringent criteria that are now adopted; welcomes disability organisations Leonard Cheshire Disability, Learning Disability Alliance Scotland (LDAS), Inclusion Scotland and many more in challenging the review&rsquo;s negative recommendation, and considers that disabled people&rsquo;s views, that the national concessionary travel scheme should include people who receive the lower rate of DLA instead of backing the unfair recommendation on eligibility from the review, should be listened to.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5377</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Lloyds Pays Huge Bonuses to Senior Managers and Cuts Everything Else</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes reports that Lloyds Banking Group, 43%-owned by the UK taxpayer, is to pay integration awards of up to 80% of basic salary to its senior managers, which would amount to &pound;828,000 for its chief executive, Eric Daniels, that the integration with HBOS has already led to the loss of over 10,000 jobs, that Lloyds is reducing pension benefits for 56,000 of its staff, that it is unlikely to meet its commitments to increase lending to small businesses and that it is considering whether to serve notice on Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland to terminate the historic covenant, effectively ending the 25-year funding relationship between the banking group and the foundation; believes that the bank&rsquo;s actions constitute gross insensitivity at a time of hardship for many, that the awards to its management break the spirit of the agreement between Lloyds Banking Group and the UK Government not to pay discretionary cash bonuses in relation to 2009 performance to any staff earning above &pound;39,000, and calls for the hypothesis that organisations perform best when they are led by people who are attracted and retained only by enormous salaries to be objectively evaluated, not least in light of the considerable evidence that an unequal society is also an unhealthy and unhappy one, as mentioned in S3M-05273.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5373</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Rule 5.6.1(c) of Standing Orders be suspended for the purpose of Members&rsquo; Business on Thursday 17 December 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5372</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Stop Demand, End Prostitution Now</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow City Council and the End Prostitution Now campaign in their aim to raise awareness of the harm caused by prostitution and to put the focus firmly on the buyers of sex who create the demand and have been invisible from the public debate until now; considers that only by targeting this demand and challenging attitudes toward buying sex will a stop be put to this harmful activity that blights Scotland&rsquo;s cities and towns; agrees that prostitution is an appalling form of human exploitation, and believes that an unequivocal message must be sent that buying sex will not be tolerated.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5371</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Lloyds Pharmacy for ALCulator Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lloyds Pharmacy on its excellent ALCulator initiative as part of its Neighbourhood Health Watch campaign; considers that the ALCulator is a valuable and accessible tool that allows internet users to type in the volume of alcohol that they are consuming each week, calculates an annual total and offers health advice depending on the results; notes that, between 2007 and 2008, there were 43,210 alcohol-related admissions to hospitals in Scotland, 33% of which were repeat admissions; recognises the need for a coordinated and consistent approach to tackling the over-consumption of alcohol, and further recognises the value of frontline services, such as pharmacies, that seek to educate the public about the dangers of over-consumption, both in relieving pressure on the NHS and in helping to tackle Scotland&rsquo;s deadly relationship with alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5370</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Top of the Lollipops</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates John Foley, the newly crowned Lollipop Person of the Year 2009, who patrols the crossing at Bushes Primary School in Paisley; notes the efforts of the pupils and parents in seeing John nominated, with their rendition of The Proclaimers&rsquo; <em>I&rsquo;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)</em>; considers Mr Foley&rsquo;s enthusiasm to be a model of excellence for all lollipop men and women across the country, and further notes that the pupils plan to spend the cash prize on creating a community garden in the school with John as Head Gardener.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5369#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Cuban Culture Comes to Coatbridge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes links between Coatbridge and Cuba in 2009, this historic 50th anniversary year of the Cuban revolution; congratulates the Mint in Coatbridge for securing Cuba-friendly status after hosting an evening of Cuban culture earlier this year; recognises that Coatbridge is becoming more Cuba-friendly as this is the second event of this kind in the area, with the first being held at Big Owen&rsquo;s Bar in 2008; understands that being a Cuba-friendly bar means offering customers the opportunity to purchase Cuban Havana Club rum to help boost the Cuban economy rather than buying Bacardi, the headquarters of which are in Bermuda and which is made in Puerto Rico; considers that Cuba-friendly events provide an opportunity to raise awareness of Cuba&rsquo;s remarkable achievements in terms of poverty reduction, healthcare and education in spite of particularly difficult circumstances, not least those imposed by the US blockade; considers that Bacardi lawyers were influential in the drafting of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which sought to extend the scope of the US embargo against Cuba; further notes that the UN General Assembly last month voted 187 to 3 in opposition to the US trade embargo on Cuba, up from 185 to 3 last year, with only Israel and the Pacific island nation of Palau supporting the United States; believes that the annual vote serves to highlight global opposition to the United State&rsquo;s hard-line policy toward the socialist island; also believes that there has never been such a wide-ranging and brutal blockade against a people as the US blockade of Cuba, believed by some to be illegal; supports the 248 MPs at Westminster who have signed Early Day Motion 1171, which calls on the UK Government to support better UK-Cuba relations, and believes that Scotland-Cuba relations and Scottish interests in the region can be encouraged through cultural and economic links.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5368</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>The Proposed Extradition of Gary McKinnon to America</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views with serious concern the proposed extradition to the United States of America of Glasgow-born Gary McKinnon, who has Asperger syndrome and who can best be described as a misguided or deluded hacker rather than a saboteur; believes that the Extradition Act 2003, which is being employed to send him to the USA, is manifestly unbalanced in that it denies both due process and equality of treatment; agrees with his mother, Janis Sharp, that &quot;we do not have equal rights with Americans&quot;; is of the view that, were Gary McKinnon to be sent to the USA to be imprisoned there, it is extremely doubtful that his human rights would be protected and his medical needs attended to in that country&rsquo;s overcrowded and chronically under-funded prison system; notes the observation made by Lord Carlile, QC, that Gary McKinnon&rsquo;s proposed extradition is disproportionate, unnecessary and avoidable, and therefore concludes that if Gary McKinnon has to stand trial for offences that he is alleged to have committed, then he should be tried in a court in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5367</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>CIEH Sets up Scotland as Region</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disappointed to note that CIEH, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, has decided to set up an administrative region in Scotland; asserts that the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland (REHIS) meets all of Scotland&rsquo;s needs with regards to environmental health, support and training; commends the good work done by REHIS; notes that REHIS overwhelmingly expressed its disapproval at CIEH&rsquo;s decision at its recent AGM, and fully supports the REHIS position.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5366</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Artist Richard Wright</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly congratulates Glasgow-based artist Richard Wright on winning the Turner Prize, the prestigious award for contemporary art, and notes that three other Scotland-based artists, Simon Starling, Douglas Gordon and Martin Creed, have recently won the prize and that Lucy Skaert, another Scotland-based artist, was also nominated, showing that Scotland is making a notable contribution to contemporary art.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-5365</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Further Powers for the Scottish Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recommendations of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution that responsibility for the law across a range of areas be devolved to the Scottish Parliament *and also* welcomes the recommendations for closer working between the Scottish and UK Ministers to ensure that the needs of Scotland are properly represented, and urges the UK Government to work with the Scottish Parliament to ensure that, where there is consensus, all such recommendations are implemented before the dissolution of the current UK Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5365.1</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Further Powers for the Scottish Parliament</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5365) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from first &quot;recommendations&quot; to end and insert &quot;proposal to strengthen devolution for Scotland and its place within the United Kingdom through the recommendations of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution and the subsequent UK Government white paper; recognises the efforts of Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats and their respective UK parties in the establishment of and support for the Calman commission, and believes that, 10 years after the establishment of devolution, the purpose of the commission was to take forward a package of greater powers and better accountability for the Scottish Parliament to enhance the devolution settlement for the benefit of all Scots.&quot;</p>
