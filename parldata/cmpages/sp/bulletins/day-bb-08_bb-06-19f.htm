<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2218</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>&quot;Shrink Paper&quot; in the Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that it has recorded a 28% reduction in paper use in the building in the last financial year, significantly exceeding the Parliament&rsquo;s Environmental Steering Group&rsquo;s target of 7.5%; congratulates all those involved in all parts of the building on achieving this success, particularly the Environmental Performance Manager; notes, however, with concern, and notwithstanding the development of recycling, that world consumption of paper has quadrupled since the 1960s and the use of printing paper has increased six-fold despite the development of electronic alternatives; is further concerned that just 10% of the world&rsquo;s population in western Europe and north America consumes more than 50% of the world&rsquo;s paper, six times above the world average, and therefore welcomes the &quot;shrink paper&quot; initiative by the European Environmental Paper Network, supported by its website www.shrinkpaper.org/index.shtml, as a means to encourage other organisations and individuals to follow the example set by staff in the Scottish Parliament and significantly reduce paper consumption where possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2217</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Josie Pasane</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the Home Office&rsquo;s decision to separate Josie Pasane from her family, with whom she has been living for seven years in Broughty Ferry, and to deport her to South Africa; expresses concern over reports that Josie received incorrect advice from the Home Office over her status which has led to the order for deportation; notes that Josie, a graduate of the University of Abertay, is in employment and is a valued member of the local community, and calls on the UK Government to urgently review her case.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2216</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Scottish Young Social Enterprise Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lenzie Academy on being presented with an award for social enterprise; notes that Lenzie Academy is working with, and has assisted in, setting up a school in Malawi, and notes the achievements of Kate Priester from Lenzie Academy who was the winner of the Young Scottish Social Entrepreneur of the Year prize.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2215</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>The Sheriff Court Fees Amendment Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Sheriff Court Fees Amendment Order 2008 (SSI 2008/239).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2214</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>The Adults with Incapacity (Public Guardian&rsquo;s Fees) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Adults with Incapacity (Public Guardian&rsquo;s Fees) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2008 (SSI 2008/238).</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2212</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>The Court of Session etc: Fees Amendment Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Court of Session etc. Fees Amendment Order 2008 (SSI 2008/236).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2211</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Handcuffing of Pregnant Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret that despite the statement from the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing on 1 May 2008 that handcuffing pregnant women is &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot; (<em>Official Report</em> c. 8177), the Scottish Prison Service and the Cabinet Secretary for Justice remain adamant that this procedure can continue in exceptional circumstances, namely potential self-harm, harm to a baby or possible danger to others; regards these as medical or psychiatric conditions, and agrees that pregnant or newly delivered offenders attending hospital from custody should be treated in the same way as other non-offenders with similar risks and should be the responsibility of obstetric, paediatric or psychiatric staff and not of the Scottish Prison Service or Reliance.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2210</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Photodynamic Therapy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Alf Stewart; recognises his support for the Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) Unit in Dundee without which that unit would not have remained open; recognises the help which can be derived from PDT in a number of conditions at a modest cost; notes that this unit and the PDT work in Glasgow requires funding in order to continue, and calls on the Scottish Government to develop this service as a national managed clinical network.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2209&diams; </strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Community First Responders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and welcomes the service provided to rural communities, such as Comrie in Perthshire, by the First Response scheme; notes that Community First Responders are local volunteers who undertake training in order to be able to provide lifesaving treatment, in the first few minutes prior to the arrival of an ambulance, to those people in the community who are critically injured or ill, and looks forward to the scheme being developed in communities across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2208</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham on behalf of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee:</strong> <strong>Report on Flooding and Flood Management</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee&rsquo;s 2nd Report, 2008 (Session 3): <em>Flooding and Flood Management (SP Paper 96)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2207</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>US Senate Armed Services Committee on Guantanamo Bay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the Armed Services Committee of the United States Senate on US interrogation techniques in Guantanamo Bay, in particular the comments of Chairman Senator Carl Levin that &quot;The truth is that senior officials in the United States Government sought information on aggressive techniques, twisted the law to create the appearance of their legality and authorised their use against detainees&quot;; believes that the use of torture is an abhorrent abuse of human rights in any circumstances, and calls for the closure of the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay as soon as possible.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2205</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Protect our Nurseries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is aware of the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s plans to reorganise nursery care provision in the Craigmillar area; notes the overwhelming opposition from parents and staff affected by the plans; agrees that the reorganisation of nursery care in the Craigmillar area will have a devastating effect on local provision and mean a huge reduction in the number of nursery places available as well as the loss of dedicated nursery facilities, resources and staff; further agrees that the lack of consultation and information given to parents and staff is totally unacceptable; is aware that an emergency public meeting will be taking place on Thursday 19 June at 7pm at Craigmillar Settlement, 63 Niddrie Mains Terrace, Edinburgh; urges all members concerned to attend and join local parents in opposing the changes being introduced and demand a full and open discussion on these proposals, and views this latest cut as yet another consequence of a flawed SNP government budget and Concordat with local government.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2204.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Youth Justice</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2204) in the name of Fergus Ewing, after &quot;around&quot; insert &quot;notes with concern the failure of the previous administration to reduce persistent young offending by 10% and recognises the increasing drain on time and resources that offence referrals are having on the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration (SCRA); recommends that an increase in disposals available to SCRA, such as an extension of drug treatment and testing orders, would enable it to intervene more effectively; recognises that the sending of 14 and 15-year-old persistent young offenders to youth courts would allow children&rsquo;s panels to concentrate more on referrals for non-offence grounds.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2204.2</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Youth Justice</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2204) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;and, while recognising the demand for services and initiatives to prevent young people offending and re-offending, considers that the criminal justice system must also seek to deal with those offenders who persist in breaking the law and disrupting communities; further recognises the important role of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2003; believes the youth court pilots have been successful and calls for further rolling out of youth courts across Scotland, and further believes that the Scottish Government should ensure adequate funding is in place to support youth services and the youth justice system across Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2204.3</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Youth Justice</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2204) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;calls on the Scottish Government to introduce children&rsquo;s rights impact assessments to show how government decisions impact on the rights and wellbeing of children; notes that young people are themselves often the victims of crime and therefore calls for the extension of the Scottish Crime Survey to under 16s; believes that young people must be engaged fully in the ongoing review of the national antisocial behaviour strategy including improving the provision of diversionary activities; calls for increased involvement of young people in delivering solutions to youth crime through innovative measures such as a youth justice board and youth justice panels, and calls for an end to the use of all ultra-sonic &quot;Mosquito&quot; dispersal devices.&quot;</p>
