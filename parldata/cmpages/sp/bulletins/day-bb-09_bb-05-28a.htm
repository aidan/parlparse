<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Liberal Democrats Debate: A Missing Children Alert System&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4245</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>A Missing Children Alert System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the establishment of strong cross-Europe working to ensure that there are effective, linked &quot;amber alert&quot; systems in place to bring European-wide attention to missing children; understands that early action is critical in locating missing and abducted children and that the experience of those countries that have alert systems in place, such as the United States of America, is extremely positive; welcomes the formal adoption of the written declaration on Emergency Cooperation In Recovering Missing Children as a resolution of the European Parliament in April 2009 but regrets that European countries currently fail to cooperate effectively when recovering missing children and that progress has been slow, and calls on the Scottish Government to work proactively and constructively with the UK Government to ensure that all missing children alert systems and cross-border cooperation policies, including the 116 000 European hotline, are operational as soon as possible to bind the country effectively into the European system. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4245.1</strong> <strong>Richard Baker: A Missing Children Alert System</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4245) in the name of Robert Brown, after &quot;UK Government&quot; insert &quot;and to encourage Scottish police forces to collaborate with their UK and European counterparts&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Liberal Democrats Debate: Supporting Scottish Business&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4246</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Supporting Scottish Business</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the serious difficulties faced by the Scottish businesses struggling to access the funds that they need during the economic downturn, with the double squeeze of late payment and tighter lending a critical concern for small businesses in particular; notes that the Welsh Assembly Government is using European Investment Bank (EIB) funding to help small businesses bridge funding gaps, supporting the expansion of 800 businesses and creating up to 15,000 jobs across Wales; regrets that the Scottish Government has not introduced a similar initiative in Scotland; further regrets the Scottish Government&rsquo;s inaction and delay in utilising the EIB funding available to it; believes that SNP ministers should use every lever at their disposal to help Scotland&rsquo;s economy, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a statement before the summer recess containing new plans to use EIB funding to support small businesses so that they do not continue to be at a competitive disadvantage to their Welsh counterparts. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4246.2</strong> <strong>Jim Mather: Supporting Scottish Business</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4246) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from &quot;regrets&quot; to end and insert &quot;further notes that the Scottish Investment Bank, announced by the First Minister on 21 April 2009, will initially bring together approximately &pound;150 million in public sector resource to support company growth in Scotland; also notes that, following this first step, the Scottish Government will look to enhance the scale and impact of such financial support to growing Scottish businesses including the potential to secure significant additional funds from the European Investment Bank through the establishment of a Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) fund for Scotland, and considers that, among other measures that the Scottish Government has introduced, its small business bonus scheme has helped the tens of thousands of Scottish firms now exempt from paying local business rates.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4246.1</strong> <strong>John Park: Supporting Scottish Business</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4246) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, insert at end &quot;and to provide detailed information about the Scottish Investment Bank proposal announced by the First Minister at the STUC conference on 21 April 2009.&quot;</p>

  <p><strong>S3M-4250</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body:</strong> <strong>Reappointment of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament nominates Karen Carlton to Her Majesty The Queen for reappointment for a second term as the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland from 1 June 2009.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Government Debate: CashBack for Communities: Investing the proceeds of crime back into our communities&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4244</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Cashback for Communities: Investing the Proceeds of Crime Back Into Our Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the fact that, since its launch in January 2008, the CashBack for Communities programme has provided positive opportunities and activities for over 100,000 young people in Scotland; recognises that providing healthy and fun activities not only gives young people something to do, but can help in reducing crime and antisocial behaviour by diverting the small minority who cause trouble away from such behaviour; welcomes the fact that the CashBack programme has been funded through &pound;12 million recovered from criminals using the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and commends the significant efforts of partners in the CashBack programme including Youthlink, Scottish Football Association, Scottish Rugby Union, Basketballscotland, Scottish Sports Futures, sportscotland, Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council, as well as the very many local projects and volunteers that are making the scheme a success. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4244.1</strong> <strong>Richard Baker: Cashback for Communities: Investing the Proceeds of Crime Back Into Our Communities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4244) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, insert at end &quot;; believes that every effort should be made to ensure further progress in recovering assets from those who profit from crime, and believes that funds obtained through the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 should continue to be focussed on projects in communities affected by crime and in activities that provide diversion from offending.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-4244.2</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Cashback for Communities: Investing the Proceeds of Crime Back Into Our Communities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4244) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, insert at end &quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to promote closer working and engagement between safer neighbourhood and community police teams and young people in efforts to prevent and tackle crime and antisocial behaviour and to ensure that the CashBack money is distributed fairly so that the whole of Scotland can reap the benefits of the scheme&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong>&#9;Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#9;Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-3741</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Inadequate Infertility Treatment in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that couples seeking fertility treatment in the NHS have to wait for 20 months in Glasgow, 13 months in Lanarkshire, 13 months in Ayrshire and Arran, 15 months in Dumfries and Galloway, three years in Lothian, six months for Lothian self-funding, up to 18 months in Grampian, up to 14 months in Highland, 12 months in Tayside, up to two years in Fife and up to two years in Forth Valley and that Orkney decides on a case-by-case basis; is pleased to learn that Shetland has no waiting restrictions; is extremely disturbed to note that Fife NHS board ranks among the worst providers of the service in Scotland in that each frozen embryo is counted as a cycle when other NHS boards require fresh and frozen embryo(s) to count as a cycle and that Fife NHS board only provides two cycles whereas other NHS boards provide three, thereby effectively giving Fife couples a third less of an opportunity for this treatment that some other couples in Scotland have; expresses particular concern that when a woman is in a relationship with a partner who has a child from a previous relationship she is denied access to any form of NHS provision in this area of specialism, and considers that NHS Lothian provides an example in increasing the age at which it accepts prospective fertility treatment candidates in consideration of the fact that many couples will not know that they need fertility treatment until their late 30s and are subsequently restricted by the unacceptable waiting times.</p>
