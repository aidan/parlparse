          <p><strong>*S3M-3049</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Scottish Youth Parliament Website</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Youth Parliament on the establishment of the new website, www.syp.org.uk, which now includes a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliament (MSYP) finder feature, making it easier for young people to communicate the issues that are important to them to their MSYPs and recognises the valuable contribution that MSYPs make to their local communities and youth politics across Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-3048</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>North Lanarkshire Council Funding for Free School Meals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the overwhelming support in the Parliament for the provision of free school meals for children in primaries one, two and three; notes the success of such a policy in other countries such as Finland; notes that the administration spokespeople in North Lanarkshire Council have claimed that it has not been provided with the necessary funds by the Scottish Government to implement this policy; considers that this claim is without foundation as the Scottish Government is making the necessary funds available through the implementation of its historic concordat with local authorities, a position which has been confirmed by the leader of COSLA; believes that, in any case, North Lanarkshire has sufficient revenues to fund this policy as a result of its gross underestimation of its council tax receipts resulting from its underestimate of the number of houses in its catchment area, and calls on the administration of North Lanarkshire Council to stop its complaints and get on with the policy of implementing the Scottish Government&rsquo;s progressive policy on school meals.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-3047</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Support the Merger Action Group&rsquo;s Appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its support for the initiative of the Merger Action Group in lodging an appeal with the Competition Appeal Tribunal against the decision by Lord Peter Mandelson, Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, not to accept the recommendation of the Office of Fair Trading to refer the proposed takeover of Halifax Bank of Scotland by Lloyds TSB to the Competition Commission; applauds the tribunal&rsquo;s decision to hear the appeal under the auspices of Scots Law; criticises the bullying behaviour of HM Treasury and the UK Government in trying to undermine the initiative taken by the Merger Action Group, which further underlines the fact that, contrary to the promises made by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the UK Government has made every effort to ensure that there is not a level playing field between the proposed takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB and alternative options; believes that if this takeover goes ahead up to 40,000 people will needlessly lose their jobs, and calls on the UK Government to reinstate the competition laws that it has suspended and ignored in this case by referring the proposed takeover to the Competition Commission in any case.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-3046</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Relaunch of Scottish Youth Parliament Website</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the relaunch of the Scottish Youth Parliament&rsquo;s website; notes that improved features include a redesign and a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliament (MSYP) finder facility aimed at improving links between young people, MSPs and MSYPs; believes&nbsp;that the Youth Parliament continues to play an important role in representing the views of young people in Scotland, and encourages all MSPs, and the wider public, to make use of the new website.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-3045</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Daily Mail - Action on Alzheimer&rsquo;s Christmas Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends <em>The Daily Mail</em> for its Action on Alzheimer&rsquo;s Christmas Campaign; recognises that dementia is no respecter of social class, intelligence or ability; notes that Scotland will see the number of people with dementia increase from 65,000 to an estimated 108,000 in 2031; acknowledges the commitment made by President Sarkozy of France to make dementia a priority during his six-month presidency of the European Union; therefore recognises the importance that campaigns such as these can play in removing the stigma and social isolation that people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s and dementia can face, and agrees that more work needs to be done to support research into the disease and improve the quality of care for people with dementia and their carers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-3044</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>SQA School Candidate of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Holli Coleman from Bellshill Academy in winning the SQA Star Award for School Candidate of the Year at the recent SQA award ceremony; recognises the outstanding achievement of Holli in securing eight Standard Grades at level 1, then five A passes at Higher and three A passes at Advanced Higher; also recognises her efforts in developing a charities week linked to Children in Need, which involved other senior pupils developing a committed team for an unprecedented week of activity and fundraising involving the whole school, and further congratulates North Lanarkshire Council&rsquo;s Department of Learning and Leisure Services for the outstanding work that it does to ensure that all pupils can achieve their full potential.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-3043</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Ireland Raises VAT</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the UK Labour government&rsquo;s decision to cut VAT, helping Scottish businesses and Scottish families; acknowledges the cut in VAT from 17.5% to 15% and notes that this contrasts favourably with the Republic of Ireland, which has just raised VAT to 21.5%; notes the comments of Torlach Denihan, Director of Retail Ireland, who said &quot;The increase in VAT makes Ireland less competitive by comparison with our nearest neighbour, Britain&quot;, and believes that this is another blow to the much-cited &quot;arc of prosperity&quot;.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-3042</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Wasps Artists&rsquo; Studios - Allowing Art to Flourish</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Wasps Artists&rsquo; Studios for the tremendous work it has been doing over the last 30 years in Scotland&rsquo;s creative art field; recognises its contribution to the arts, which is personified in some of Scotland&rsquo;s finest artists, such as Donald Urquhart, who have been using Wasps&rsquo; studios to harness their talent; applauds Wasps&rsquo; efforts to be fully self-sustainable by 2012; believes that government on all levels should continue to support this important sector, which undoubtedly enriches Scotland; wishes Wasps Artists&rsquo; Studios well in the future, and looks forward to its next generation of budding artists.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-3041</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Forced Redundancies at Herald and Times Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is extremely concerned about the action of Newsquest&rsquo;s new editor-in-chief of the Herald and Times Group, Donald Martin, who has announced that all editorial staff on <em>The Herald</em>, <em>Sunday Herald</em> and <em>The Evening Times</em> will be made redundant; notes that, while some staff may be rehired on a new contract, it is feared that this will lead to the loss of 30 to 40 jobs, and that, in most cases, this will mean reduced pay and conditions, including loss of holiday entitlement and the introduction of new enforced shift patterns; further notes the comments of National Union of Journalists (NUJ) Scottish organiser Paul Holleran that &quot;this is a brutal attempt at forcing changes&quot; and, with regard to the adoption of new production technology, &quot;every other media employer in Scotland is working with the union to try to handle these changes in a civilised manner&quot;; also notes the existing concerns of staff about stress and other health and safety issues; believes that the actions of the group are unwarranted and unacceptable and can only harm the newspaper industry in Scotland, and further believes that the actions should be rescinded and that the group should seek to work with the NUJ to ensure that the introduction of technological change is subject to a properly negotiated agreement with the workforce.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-3040</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>NFUS and the Scottish Fair Trade Forum Join Forces</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the link-up between the National Farmers&rsquo; Union Scotland (NFUS) and the Scottish Fair Trade Forum (SFTF) to promote a fair deal for producers in Scotland and in the developing world; notes the two organisations&rsquo; common goal of ensuring that producers are paid a fair price for their goods, which will allow farmers to operate sustainably regardless of where they farm in the world, and encourages people to actively support and buy local produce and Fairtrade products.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-3039</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Call for Review of UK Employment Law</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern recent actions by Euro Car Parts, which sacked over 600 staff just a week after acquiring long-established firm LSUK Ltd, better known as Lucas, including its depots at Kilmarnock, Edinburgh and elsewhere in Scotland, by the posting of notices on depot doors; expresses its sympathies for the workers and their families, and calls on the UK Government to undertake an urgent examination of UK employment law, with a view to bringing forward to the UK Parliament any changes necessary to create an employment framework fit for the 21st century, to prevent Scottish workers facing such Dickensian employment practices and to reinforce the responsibility of company directors to ensure proper consultation with and treatment of a company&rsquo;s workforce.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-3038#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Devastating Cuts At The Herald and Evening Times</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the announcement that all staff at <em>The Herald </em>and <em>Evening Times</em> in Glasgow will be made redundant and have to re-apply for their jobs under new terms and conditions, which it believes will inevitably leave them worse off, and further believes that this reorganisation will have a damaging effect on editorial independence among the titles and should be re-evaluated.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-3037</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Herald and Times Group Redundancies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views as extremely serious the announcement that the Herald and Times Group will make redundant all of its 250 journalists and invite them to reapply for their jobs; believes that this is a draconian employment practice, especially in light of significant profits recorded last year; acknowledges the importance of the Herald and Times Group to the newspaper industry and that <em>The Herald</em>, being one of the oldest newspapers in the United Kingdom, and <em>The Evening Times</em> have played a significant role in reporting on the daily life of Glasgow and Scotland, and calls on the Herald and Times Group&rsquo;s management to meet with the National Union of Journalists with a view to withdrawing this plan.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-2981</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>British Government Invoke Anti-Terrorist Legislation on Iceland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the news that the British Government has invoked anti-terrorist legislation, which many people believe is perceived to be aimed at Iceland through freezing the funds owned, held or controlled by the Icelandic bank, Landsbanki, and acknowledges that people in Iceland, through the petition website www.indefence.is, which has over 80,000 signatures, believe that the British Government is acting indiscriminately and affecting the interests of Iceland, its actions serving only to exacerbate the problems for Iceland during the current difficult economic climate.</p>
