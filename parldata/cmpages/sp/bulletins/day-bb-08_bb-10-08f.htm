<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2677</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1 be completed by 23 January 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2676</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Alcohol Awareness Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Scotland&rsquo;s Alcohol Awareness Week; notes the work done by the alcohol industry, health professionals, the voluntary sector and police forces across the country; further notes the success of initiatives such as the Designated Place at Albyn House in Aberdeen in helping those who are drunk and incapable as well as easing the burden on hard-pressed hospitals and the pressure on police cells, and calls on local and national partners to put in place long-term funding for projects such as Albyn House without further delay.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2675</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>West Harris Estates Buyout</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that on Friday 3 October 2008 the people of the west side of Harris voted to progress towards a community buyout of their estate; notes that tenants of the West Harris estates in the townships of Luskentyre, Scarasta Mhor and Borve, which includes the villages of Seilibost and Horgabost, voted to proceed with the buyout of these estates, which would be the first community buyout of a government-owned estate in the history of land reform legislation, with 77% in favour of a buyout and all three estates voting yes on a turnout of 95%; hopes that this is the first step towards a better future for people in the west of Harris; believes that, like other examples throughout the Highlands and Islands, community ownership will provide a great incentive for these communities to develop economically and to retain and grow their population, and wishes the communities every success with the venture they have embarked on.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2674</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Canongate Primary School, Scotland&rsquo;s 700th Eco-School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Canongate Primary School in St Andrews on becoming the 700th Scottish school to be awarded the prestigious Eco-Schools Green Flag; recognises that this award has been achieved as a result of the hard work of children, teachers and parents at the school; welcomes the fact that pupil participation is at the heart of the Eco-Schools programme, and encourages other schools in Scotland to join Canongate Primary and the other 699 schools by becoming an eco-school.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2673&diams;</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Scottish Asian Action Committee&rsquo;s 25th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Asian Action Committee (SAAC) on its 25th anniversary celebrations, having been founded in 1983 as a broad-based secular organisation providing a community development, campaigning and advice information service for ethnic minority communities in Scotland, originally made up of groups representing Pakistani, Indian, Kashmiri, Bengali and Bangladeshi communities, and notes that SAAC was a catalyst for activities such as the Glasgow Mela and the annual day of action against racism and was recently honoured with an Outstanding Achievement Award at the Scottish BME Achievement Awards, acknowledging its work in community development and anti-racism initiatives as well as its welfare rights and immigration advice services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2672</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Compensation for Sea Eagle Predation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the success of the sea eagle reintroduction program, which has seen the birds breeding well; notes however that this has resulted in crofters and farmers loosing many lambs as a result of predation; further notes that a scheme on Mull, Lochaber and Skye compensates for stock losses due to sea eagle predation, and believes this scheme should be extended to Wester Ross and all areas where there is evidence of sea eagle predation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2671.1</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Scottish Broadcasting Commission</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2671) in the name of Linda Fabiani, after second &quot;broadcasting industry&quot; insert &quot;but believes that further work needs to be done on a suitable funding model, which ensures a substantial private sector input so that the cost does not fall wholly on the taxpayer&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2671.2</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Scottish Broadcasting Commission</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2671) in the name of Linda Fabiani, insert at end &quot;and notes with concern the proposals contained within Phase 2 of Ofcom&rsquo;s Second Public Sector Broadcasting Review, which present a serious threat to the long-term viability of Scottish public sector broadcasters, of Borders news programmes and of Scottish content programming and Gaelic language programmes on Channel 3.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2671.3</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Scottish Broadcasting Commission</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2671) in the name of Linda Fabiani, insert at end &quot;; agrees with the commission that Scotland should not lose out on the obvious advantages of being part of the UK broadcasting  framework, particularly in research and development of digital media platforms, and believes that the Calman Commission should consider the role of the Parliament in playing an active role in scrutinising and promoting the broadcasting industry as it relates to Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2668&diams; </strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>School Meals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the need to examine the current school meals crisis in Edinburgh and across the country as a result of severely cash-strapped local authorities; questions the SNP government&rsquo;s success in fulfilling its ambitions, set out in the historic concordat and single outcome agreements, to tackle childhood obesity and promote healthy eating at a time when school kitchens are closing and hot healthy school meals are being replaced with imported, pre-packed, often processed food; feels that these actions undermine the good reputation that the Parliament has achieved in securing free healthy school meals and promoting healthy living through initiatives like Hungry for Success, and further recognises the need to give every child the best possible start in life.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2668.1</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>School Meals</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2668) in the name of George Foulkes, leave out from first &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;considers that George Foulkes MSP would be better lobbying his Westminster colleagues for the additional resources that Scotland needs and deserves than complaining about how existing resources are being spent; is aware that UK Government significantly underestimated the level of inflation for this year, impacting on the ability of the Scottish Government and the areas over which it has responsibility to deliver services as effectively as would otherwise be the case, and believes that the UK Government should make good the financial shortfall caused by the tightness of this year&rsquo;s settlement in order that the Scottish Government can pass on those resources proportionately to local government, the NHS and all other departments.&quot;</p>
