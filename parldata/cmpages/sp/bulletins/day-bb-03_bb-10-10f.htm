          <p><strong>*S2M-488</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>United 
            Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises United Nations International Day for the 
            Eradication of Poverty on 17 October 2003 as an opportunity to raise 
            awareness of the issue of poverty; believes that poverty is neither 
            inevitable nor acceptable; recognises that far too many of our fellow 
            Scots still live in poverty and that throughout the world the gap 
            between rich and poor has widened, and urges the Scottish Executive 
            to do far more to tackle poverty and to ensure that Scotland plays 
            a full role in the international community to begin to close the gap 
            between rich and poor throughout the world.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-487#</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> 
            <strong>Renewable Energy and Wind Farm Guidance</strong>-That the 
            Parliament recognises the need for the development of renewable sources 
            of energy; welcomes the work being done to ensure that Scotland becomes 
            a market leader for wave, tidal and offshore wind energy generation 
            and hydrogen fuel cells; recognises that wind farms, as the only currently 
            commercially viable new renewable technology, have an important contribution 
            to make to the mix of Scotland's energy generation; notes, however, 
            that the absence of clear, concise and coherent guidelines for the 
            approval of wind farm sites is causing anxiety in many Scottish communities 
            and uncertainty for developers; is concerned that, without such guidelines, 
            public support for renewable energy is in danger of being undermined, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive must urgently publish guidance 
            on the criteria being applied to wind farm developments, take positive 
            steps to promote and assist community-led renewable energy projects 
            including wind farm developments, engage with the Ministry of Defence 
            regarding its objections to wind farm developments on or near Ministry 
            of Defence property, and encourage developers to recognise their responsibilities 
            to local communities so that the common good of such communities can 
            benefit from developments on their door step.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-486</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Sexual 
            Health Misinformation</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication 
            of pamphlets stating that condoms are not reliable in preventing the 
            spread of HIV, as discovered by BBC Panorama researchers working in 
            Kenya and other areas of high HIV prevalence; opposes the spread of 
            such misinformation in Scotland; condemns those who publish, promote 
            or endorse such life-threatening propaganda, whether abroad or in 
            Scotland; notes the opinion of the US National Institutes of Health 
            and other expert opinion worldwide that intact latex condoms are essentially 
            impermeable to even the smallest sexually transmitted virus, hepatitis 
            B; notes the intention of the Scottish Executive to publish the report 
            of the Sexual Health Strategy expert group in the near future, and 
            believes that any effective sexual health strategy for Scotland will 
            include the promotion of condom use and safer sex practices among 
            other approaches.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-485</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses</strong>-That the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive's 
            declared aim to "give young people the skills they need to take an 
            entrepreneurial spirit from the classroom into a confident and prosperous 
            Scotland"; recognises that confidence grows from the very earliest 
            age and that nursery education is critical to instilling confidence 
            in present and future generations; recognises the pivotal role played 
            by nursery nurses in that process; considers that to invest in their 
            pay and career structure is to invest in our children and country's 
            future, and further considers that the Executive should declare support 
            for the nursery nurses' current grading claim and take steps to ensure 
            funding and settlement of that claim.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Colin Fox<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-484</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>1820 
            Martyrs</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its concern that 'more 
            materials' regarding the 1820 Martyrs, as referred to by the then 
            Deputy Minister for Education and Young People, Nicol Stephen, on 
            5 September 2001 (<em>Official report</em>, c 2263), have not yet 
            been produced; notes that the answer given by the Minister for Education 
            and Young People, Peter Peacock, on 22 September 2003 to question 
            S2W-2170 does not re-affirm that more materials will be produced; 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise fully this important 
            act of civil unrest in Scottish history when working class people 
            rose against the British state to obtain a better standard of living 
            and demonstrated under the banner 'Scotland Free or a Desert'; further 
            calls on the Executive and Inverclyde Council to provide a memorial 
            to the demonstrators, men, women and children, who were shot indiscriminately 
            by the British Army in Greenock as they protested against the holding 
            of political prisoners in Greenock jail; recognises the need for Scottish 
            history to be preserved and taught to schoolchildren, and calls on 
            the Executive to provide these materials forthwith to enlighten current 
            schoolchildren and future generations of the struggle for better living 
            conditions and independence.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-483</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Threatened 
            End of Manufacturing at Hoover, Cambuslang</strong>-That the Parliament 
            is deeply concerned at the threatened loss of 250 direct and an estimated 
            1,000 indirect jobs as a result of Hoover's announcement that it is 
            ending manufacturing at its Cambuslang plant, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should immediately establish a task force in association 
            with Scottish Enterprise, South Lanarkshire Council, trade unions 
            and others to explore with Hoover any options which will allow the 
            retention of a manufacturing element within Hoover, Cambuslang, and 
            to tackle the employment consequences and the human and social disaster 
            of the proposed cutback in the Cambuslang and Rutherglen area.</P>

            Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Mike Rumbles<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S2M-482#</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Development 
            of Oban Harbour</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that 
            Oban, the crossroads to the west highlands and islands, is being economically 
            constrained by the lack of strategic development of the harbour resulting 
            in a knock-on effect on the north Argyll islands and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should work with Argyll and Bute Council, Highland 
            and Islands Enterprise and all other stakeholders to develop the infrastructure 
            in Oban harbour in a strategic way so that it can meet the future 
            need for berthing facilities for the increasing number of ferries, 
            cruise liners, pleasure boats, yachts and fishing boats that use the 
            harbour.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-481#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Women's 
            Social and Political Union</strong>-That the Parliament notes that, 
            on 10 October 1903, a group of women met in the Manchester home of 
            Emmeline Pankhurst and founded the Women's Social and Political Union, 
            which became known as the suffragette movement, with the aim of recruiting 
            more working class women into the struggle for the vote and believes 
            that this centenary year should be marked by efforts to promote the 
            participation of women in the democratic process.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-480</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Call 
            for Inquiry into 118118 Directory Inquiry Service</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes with concern increasing reports of inaccurate numbers 
            being given in response to inquiries made of the new 118118 directory 
            inquiry service; calls upon Oftel to conduct an investigation into 
            whether these providers are up to adequate standards and, if they 
            are not, to take appropriate action, and further calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to ensure that the interests of Scottish consumers are safeguarded.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-479</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Recognising 
            the Achievements of Professor John Mallard</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the outstanding contribution to science of Professor John 
            Mallard and his team at the University of Aberdeen who were instrumental 
            in the development of magnetic resonance imaging technology in the 
            late 1970s and early 1980s; notes that this work was built upon across 
            the world and was of fundamental importance to the 2003 Nobel Award 
            in Physiology or Medicine being awarded to teams from the Universities 
            of Nottingham and Illinois for developing new applications for this 
            technology; further notes that Scotland has a proud record of world-beating 
            science, and calls on the Scottish Executive to redouble efforts to 
            encourage such scientific progress and to retain the benefits in Scotland 
            rather than exporting technology and commercial advantage overseas.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-478#</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>CSV 
            'Make a Difference Day'</strong>-That the Parliament fully supports 
            the CSV 'Make a Difference Day' on 25 October 2003, the UK's biggest 
            day of direct volunteering action; recognises the important role the 
            CSV plays in providing opportunities for people to work together to 
            made a difference in their communities; further recognises that volunteering 
            makes an enormous contribution to the social, economic, environmental 
            and cultural life of Scotland, and applauds the volunteers taking 
            part in 'Make a Difference Day' on 25 October.</P>
          <p>*<strong>S2M-477</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack on behalf of the Environment 
            and Rural Development Committee:</strong> <strong>Rural Development 
            Committee, 1st Report 2003 (Session 1): Inquiry into Integrated Rural 
            Development</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recommendations 
            contained in the Rural Development Committee's 1st Report 2003 (Session

          <p><strong>*S2M-476</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Welcome 
            for Announcement by Shell UK</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the news announcement at Fife NGL plant by Shell UK in the past week 
            that has the effect of helping to secure current and future investment 
            in Fife and the north of Scotland in the oil and gas industry; congratulates 
            the stakeholders including Her Majesty's Government, the Norwegian 
            Government, Shell UK, ExxonMobil and the trade unions who have worked 
            in partnership to bring benefit to the Scottish economy and safeguard 
            the future of the Mosmorran and St Fergus plants for up to 15 years, 
            and notes the wider impact that this announcement will have on contracting 
            and sub-contracting companies.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-475</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes:</strong> <strong>Job 
            Losses at Hoover Plant, Cambuslang</strong>-That the Parliament expresses 
            its deep regret at the announcement by Hoover of its intention to 
            have discussions on the cessation of manufacturing at its Cambuslang 
            plant; recognises the valuable role that the workforce in Cambuslang 
            has played in the history of the Hoover company for almost 60 years; 
            urges Hoover to reconsider its decision to cease manufacturing in 
            Scotland; further expresses its particular concern that the company 
            intends to transfer some manufacturing to Wales, and calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to do everything within its power to support the 
            workforce at Cambuslang.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-474</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Horse 
            Racing Industry in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the significant contribution that the horse racing industry makes 
            to the economy, generating up to £125 million *annually* and providing 
            the equivalent of 1700 full-time jobs; commends the success of the 
            racing industry in continuing to expand and develop, recognising its 
            contribution to local economies and tourism; notes that there is widespread 
            concern regarding the potential implications of the proposed Office 
            of Fair Trading (OFT) rule 14 notice on the deregulation of the British 
            horse racing industry and, in particular, on its likely impact on 
            Scotland's five racecourses, Ayr, Hamilton Park, Kelso, Musselburgh 
            and Perth, each of which is independently owned and managed with profits 
            generated ploughed back into the sport for long-term growth, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should work with representatives of the 
            racing industry to identify opportunities to promote and develop the 
            industry and to explore the possible implications of the OFT ruling.</P>
