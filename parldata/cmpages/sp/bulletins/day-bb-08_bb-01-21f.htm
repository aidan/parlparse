<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1183</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Scottish Federation of Housing Associations - Fuel Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing number of households experiencing fuel poverty in Scotland, currently estimated at 650,000 households, with research by Communities Scotland calculating that for every 5% increase in fuel prices an extra 30,000 households will end up in fuel poverty; recognises that fuel poverty is a key concern within the affordable housing sector, particularly in rural areas which are often off-grid, and commends the work of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations as well as other organisations like energywatch and Energy Action Scotland in highlighting the plight of households struggling to pay for their energy; further recognises that Scotland has a disproportionate number of fuel-poor households compared with England or Wales and that many of these households are on the prepayment meter (PPM) system of paying for their energy; notes with concern that customers using the prepayment system to pay for their energy are currently paying an average of &pound;214 per year more than those who have signed up for suppliers&rsquo; online direct debit tariffs; further notes that there are related problems with the current system of PPMs, such as infrequent recalibration which not only allows debt to build up for the customer, often without them being aware of it, but places a time and financial cost burden on registered social landlords; calls on the Scottish Government to make representations to Ofgem to undertake a comprehensive review of charges for PPM customers and calls on suppliers to do more to identify and intervene to help the most vulnerable customers before they accrue large debts; calls for further action to honour the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 to eradicate fuel poverty by 2016, and recognises the role that smart meters and social tariffs play in helping to reduce levels of fuel poverty and to fulfil the expectation outlined in the Energy White Paper that, within the next 10 years, all domestic energy customers will have smart meters.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1182</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Problem Gambling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that approximately 0.7% to 0.8% of the adult Scottish population, or approximately 35,000 to 40,000 individuals, are problem gamblers; acknowledges the negative impacts of problem gambling on society, including anxiety, increased abuse of alcohol, disruption of family relationships, decreased productivity in the workplace due to absenteeism and preoccupation with gambling, increased incidences of incarceration or arrest, depression and suicide; recognises the need to reduce the prevalence of problem gambling and alleviate its corresponding social ills, and believes that casinos and other gambling institutions should be accountable for the harm that they promote by contributing financially to a fund to be used for educating the public about the potential dangers of problem gambling as well as for the treatment of individuals who already struggle with problem gambling.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1181</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Shetland Islands Council Appeal Against State Aid Ruling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the ruling by the European Commission, under State Aid regulations, that Shetland Islands Council must recover monies invested in the local fishing industry using funds paid to Shetland Islands Council by the oil industry as compensation for the disruption caused by the construction of Europe&rsquo;s largest oil terminal at Sullom Voe; further notes that, if the monies have to be repaid, this will impact directly on 78 individual Shetland fishermen who received grants to allow them to invest in boats; is disappointed that the UK Government, as the Member State, is not to lodge an appeal, but welcomes the decision by Shetland Islands Council to appeal this decision to the European Court of Justice, and calls on both the Scottish and UK governments to support and assist Shetland Islands Council, both with the appeal and in discussions with the European Commission, in order to bring this matter to a successful outcome for Shetland and allow the council to continue to build, maintain and sustain the local fishing industry.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1146</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Fife Council Places Elderly People in Danger</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that NHS Fife achieved its target in April 2007 of less than 20 delayed discharges over six weeks and no patients in a short stay bed, immediately prior to the change in control from a Labour-controlled Fife Council to an SNP/Liberal Democrat-controlled council but notes that, since the change of political administration, Fife has seen an upward trend in the number of delayed discharges to 164 on 15 September 2007; further notes that, according to a report from NHS Fife, the three main emerging reasons for delays in securing community care arrangements as at the September 2007 census were: non-availability of council funding for care home places, awaiting residential home places and awaiting social support to live at home; further notes that according to a survey of Fife care homes carried out in the last week, some owners of such homes report vacancies being available; recognises that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing advised that &pound;3.5 million would be made available by NHS Fife to Fife Council on a one-off basis to help with the situation but expresses grave concern that patients with urgent cases of dementia and at serious risk are being denied places in specialist homes as a consequence of SNP/Liberal Democrat Fife Council&rsquo;s decision to cut social work funding and limit finance available and considers that, as a consequence, Fife Council is failing to protect the frailest and most vulnerable people in Fife, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to act as a matter of urgency to ensure that serious danger to our elderly people in Fife is avoided.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1141</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>SNP/Lib-Dems&rsquo; Shopping Charges Hit the Most Frail and Vulnerable People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the fact that the weakest and most vulnerable people in Fife have been compelled by Fife Council to face charges of &pound;7 per trip for their shopping to be done and regrets that it is the vulnerable, the voiceless and the most frail victims of Fife who are having to balance the books of the new SNP/Liberal Democrat-controlled Fife Council, against a background that on the day a budget was agreed by Fife Council early in 2006 the SNP proposed a budget of &pound;1 million less than the previous Labour administration.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1136</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>100 Years on, Remembering Emmeline Pankhurst</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament remembers all those who fought over the years for the right to vote and particularly remembers that 100 years ago Emmeline Pankhurst, the leading suffragette and founder of the Women&rsquo;s Social and Political Union in the battle for the right to vote, wrote powerfully on 18 February 1908 from Holloway jail giving her vivid account of the drudgery and misery, meagre rations, coarse clothing with its convicts&rsquo; arrows and her stark surroundings and notes her subsequent removal to hospital; further notes that on 10 January 1918 the House of Lords approved the Representation of the People Bill giving married women aged over 30 the vote and the US House of Representatives in Washington voted in favour of women&rsquo;s suffrage, and hopes that political parties across the country will celebrate the involvement of women in politics.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1135</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Wheelchairs - an Essential Aid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the last administration carried out a review of wheelchair services and reported to the Parliament that the service was underfunded by &pound;2.4 million and provided an extra &pound;1 million to help reduce waiting times; further notes that PAMIS (Promoting a More Inclusive Society) and the Scottish Disability Equality Forum state that the funding announcement by the Scottish Government is in fact only &pound;3 million and not the &pound;4 million given in the earlier announcement but, recognising the underfunding identified in the report to the Parliament, the government&rsquo;s announcement just puts the service where it should have been had NHS boards ensured that the service kept pace with annual uplifts; recognises that the waiting lists for wheelchair users across Scotland pose major problems for all individuals who cannot access wheelchairs particularly those of a specialist nature, and calls on the Scottish Government to monitor carefully and report on an annual basis to the Parliament whether the supply of wheelchairs is matching the needs of all requiring the use of wheelchairs.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1128</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Car Parking at the Vale of Leven Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde decided in July 2007 to impose car parking charges in hospitals across its area; further notes the conclusions of the review group established by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to investigate the effect of the car park charging policy; considers that all management options should be exhausted before moving from providing free car parking; acknowledges that one of the stated reasons for introducing car parking charges is to discourage commuters who use hospital car parks but do not attend the hospital; nevertheless strongly believes that the Vale of Leven Hospital should be exempt from car parking charges because it is not affected by this problem of commuters using car parking inappropriately; recognises that car parking charges would be an unfair burden on low-paid staff, patients and visitors alike, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to exempt the Vale of Leven Hospital from the car parking charges scheme.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1126</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Deprivation and Health</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the relationship between deprivation and poor health is acknowledged by many bodies, including ASH Scotland, Have a Heart Paisley, NHS Scotland, the British Heart Foundation and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; deplores the level of poverty in the United Kingdom despite its high GDP as noted, for example, by motions S3M-60, S3M-724, S3M-995<strong>, </strong>S3M-1005 and S3M-1094; is of the opinion that unless significant progress is made in reducing wealth inequalities then strategies to reduce health inequalities will have limited impact; believes, therefore, that a failure to significantly reduce wealth inequalities can only have three possible explanations: incompetence, ignorance of the relationship between deprivation and health, or the deliberate condemnation of many thousands of people to premature death, and, in light of the foregoing, urges the UK Government urgently to reassess its priorities and specifically to reconsider the use to which it puts oil revenues, its planned expenditure on nuclear weaponry and identity cards and its policy on tax loopholes for the super-rich.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-483#</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Time for a Fresh Debate on Organ Donation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the ongoing work that British Medical Association Scotland is doing to raise awareness of organ donation; recognises that the number of people on the active and temporarily suspended transplant waiting list in Scotland rose by almost 20% from 695 in September 2005 to its highest level of 818 in July 2007 and yet only 50 organs were donated in Scotland last year and that at 10 June 2007 there were 135 people in the NHS Lothian area registered with UK Transplant as waiting for an organ; recognises that the current opt-in system of organ donation is unable to meet the increasing demands placed upon it; acknowledges the need for a full and proper public debate to establish the level of support that exists for a move to a system of presumed consent that will both inform future proposals in this area and raise awareness of the desperate need for organ donors, and considers that moves to turn the tremendous level of public and, increasingly, professional support that exists for organ donation into something meaningful should be supported by implementing a system of presumed consent.</p>
