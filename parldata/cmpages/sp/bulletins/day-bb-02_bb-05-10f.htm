            and Arran Tourist Board and its Chief Executive Janet Reuben on the 
            resounding success of the first &quot;Burns and a&#146; that&quot; 
            festival which was held in Ayrshire between 27 April and 5<sup> </sup>May

            to Fraserburgh Football Club on Winning the <em>Press and Journal</em> 
            Highland League Title</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            Fraserburgh Football Club on its winning of the <em>Press and Journal</em> 
            Highland League title; notes that this achievement was last accomplished 
            by the club 64 years ago; further notes the dedication and enthusiasm 
            of all players and team staff; believes that the team and its travelling 
            fans are a credit to the local community, and wishes the team all 
            the very best for future football seasons.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3094#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Increase 
            in the Number of Civil Service Jobs Located in the Highlands</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that in the region of 2,000 civil service jobs 
            are required in The Highlands to achieve parity with other areas; 
            supports the move of the Highland Council and Highland and Islands 
            Enterprise to convince the Scottish Executive to relocate the headquarters 
            of Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Arts Council to the 
            north, and recognises that all of Scotland must benefit from the dispersal 
            of civil service jobs in a decentralised, devolved Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3093#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Continuing 
            Crisis in Rural Healthcare</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            with concern the decision of Dr Peter Joiner to leave his general 
            practice in Lybster, Caithness; expresses concern at his description 
            of the intolerable pressures placed on single GP practices in remote 
            and rural areas; further notes the pattern of recent GP resignations 
            in Helmsdale and Argyll; regrets the inactivity of the Scottish Executive 
            in tackling this issue, and supports immediate remedial action to 
            avoid further resignations and retirements in Scotland.</a></p>
