            Ayr United Football Club on its achievement in reaching the final 
            of the CIS Insurance Cup; welcomes the congratulations being offered 
            from all quarters and, in particular, from residents and natives of 
            Kilmarnock and from supporters of Kilmarnock Football Club and also 
            expressed in motion S1M-2713 in the name of Adam Ingram MSP and notes 
            the generous spirit which inspired it; is aware that Ayr United have 
            appeared twice in the final of the B&amp;Q Cup; further notes that 
            planning permission exists for the construction of a new stadium in 
            Heathfield, Ayr and further welcomes the Scottish Executive's abandonment 
            of its defence against the appeal by Heritage Scotland Ltd. against 
            the Scottish Ministers' determination of the planning application; 
            calls for the removal of the onerous conditions attached by the Scottish 
            Ministers to the consent granted for the stadium and looks forward 
            to Ayr United playing Premier League football in a new stadium.</p>

            to the Scotland Zimbabwe Group, recently formed to highlight the appalling 
            abuse of human rights in Zimbabwe; strongly endorses the principles 
            of the group, which seeks a free and fair presidential election in 
            Zimbabwe and freedom of speech for its people; encourages MSPs and 
            members of the public to attend the group&#146;s vigil to be held 
            on the Mound in Edinburgh on Saturday 9 February, so demonstrating 
            our solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe, and demands that the President 
            and Government of Zimbabwe cease their abuse of human rights forthwith

          <p> <strong>S1M-2723</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Burdens on

            strip stamps to Scotch Whisky products, but not to wine or beer, in 
            an attempt to curb fraud; believes that the case for such strip stamps 
            is not yet proven as they are costly and relatively easy to forge, 
            as found in the USA and Greece where they have been abolished, and 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should work with the Scotch whisky 
            industry to avoid such additional burdens being placed on our whisky 
            industry, for example by taking advantage of the exemption from the 
            EU&#146;s Water Framework Directive.</p>

            Insurance Cup Final, its first major cup final in the club&#146;s

            adventure courses provided by <strong>sport</strong>scotland at the 
            National Outdoor Training Centre at Glenmore Lodge, Aviemore and recognises 
            the importance of outdoor pursuits to the development of young people&#146;s 
            health, fitness and self-reliance, the worth of careers as instructors 
            for young people in rural areas and the importance of outdoor pursuits

          <p> <strong>S1M-2719#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie: World Wide Clubhouse 
            Movement</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the establishment 
            in New York of the worldwide clubhouse movement for psychiatric rehabilitation 
            in 1948; further notes the siting of the first clubhouse in Scotland 
            under the management of the Scottish Association for Mental Health 
            in Dunfermline in 1992, which moved to new, expanded premises in the 
            summer of 2001 and is now one of seven situated throughout Scotland; 
            congratulates it on being the first in Scotland to be accredited by

            from 3 to 6 July 2002 involving representatives from similar projects 
            in Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Australasia, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should encourage and expand this model 
            of community care.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2718#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie: NHS Fife</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates NHS Fife on its decision to bring all 
            domestic service, portering and catering contracts which were previously 
            outsourced back into the direct management of the NHS; notes that 
            due to an increase in the cleaning contract specification there will 
            be a welcome improvement in the general cleanliness of Fife&#146;s 
            health facilities which will benefit patients and several hundred 
            staff, and believes that this action recreates the &quot;NHS team&quot; 
            and that this policy should be extended throughout Scotland.</p>

            are made available on the NHS; recognises the role of MS campaigners 
            over many years on this issue; notes that up to 1,600 people with 
            MS could benefit from this decision; welcomes the innovative 'risk-taking' 
            scheme, and believes that a partnership approach with patients, the 
            voluntary sector and others must be an important part of the future 
            development of services for people with MS.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2716</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Scottish Executive 
            Policy on Advertising</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            current recruitment advertising policy of the Scottish Executive that 
            has seen over £1 million spent in the <em>Scotsman</em> and <em>Herald 
            </em>newspapers from 1998 to 2001 compared to barely £100,000 in the 
            <em>Courier </em>and <em>Press and Journal</em>; is concerned that the 
            dissemination of information on job availability with the Scottish 
            Executive may not reach many able candidates outwith the central belt, 
            particularly since the <em>Press and Journal </em>and <em>Courier </em>readerships 
            are on a par with the <em>Scotsman</em> and <em>Herald</em>; further notes 
            that more has been spent advertising vacancies in London based newspapers 
            than in newspapers in the north east of Scotland and that posts where 
            the specialism exists in this area, such as the Chief Executive of 
            the Fisheries Research Service, have not been advertised in north 
            east newspapers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review its 
            current policy to ensure that people from across all of Scotland learn 
            about available posts.</p>

            the joint Scottish Arts Council and VisitScotland document <em>A Soundtrack 
            for Scottish Tourism</em> which describes a variety of pilot projects 
            operating in a number of different areas throughout Scotland from 
            1999 to 2002; notes the widespread local, national and international 
            interest shown in each project; further notes that the effect on all 
            local areas involved included clear business and tourism benefits 
            in both the short and longer term; recognises the uniqueness of Scotland&#146;s 
            traditional culture and the enormous contribution it can make to revitalising 
            the tourist sector and, in particular, the rural economy, and calls

          <p> <strong>S1M-2714#</strong> <strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan: British Trade

            incursions by the Israeli defence forces into areas controlled by 
            the Palestinian Authority and believes that Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            should cease all trade with Israel until the Israeli Government complies 
            with United Nations Resolution 242.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2711#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty: UN 0.7% GNP Target 
            for Development Assistance</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            that the economic consequences of the tragic events of 11 September 
            2001 will have severe and adverse impacts on developing countries, 
            particularly sub-Sahara Africa; recognises the commitment by international 
            institutions and Her Majesty's Government to the goal of halving the 
            proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015; shares the 
            concerns raised by the World Bank and others that without significantly 
            increased development assistance many countries will fail to reach 
            this goal; praises the actions by the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway 
            and Denmark for consistently achieving the UN 0.7% GNP target for 
            development assistance over many years, and congratulates Luxembourg 
            for achieving the target in 2000 and Portugal and Ireland for setting 
            dates to achieve the target, in 2006 and 2007 respectively; recognises 
            the principle that successful poverty reduction is an essential foundation 
            of stability in an increasingly globalised world; believes that the 
            adoption of an intermediate target of 0.4% for overseas development 
            assistance by 2006 with the goal of achieving the UN 0.7% GNP target 
            by 2012 would strengthen the United Kingdom&#146;s advocacy role; 
            welcomes the leadership shown by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, 
            Gordon Brown, and the Secretary of State for International Development, 
            Claire Short, in establishing a Commonwealth Education Fund to support 
            disadvantaged children in Commonwealth countries, and commends the 
            work of those charities and agencies in Scotland who not only take 
            forward development work in many of the poorer countries but also 
            play a vital role in informing the Scottish people about the importance

            of decline in the population of Inverclyde between 2001 and 2016, 
            the highest predicted depopulation of Scotland&#146;s 32 council areas; 
            recognises that a main cause of this depopulation is lack of job opportunities; 
            believes that this decline places an intolerable burden on the remaining 
            population in terms of council tax and service delivery, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should establish a task force with the 
            resources to address the problems facing Inverclyde, with a view to

            largest union in Britain, bringing the benefits of union membership 
            to over one million people, and believes that Amicus will continue 
            to support and promote training and skills development, pension rights, 
            health and safety issues, environmental concerns and involvement and 
            consultation in decision-making by and on behalf of its members.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2700</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: GM Crop Trials</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament believes that the GM crop trials, proposed for three 
            farms in Aberdeenshire and Fife and announced by the Scottish Executive 
            on 31 January 2002, should not proceed in the light of (a) the report 
            by the Royal Society on 4 February 2002, (b) the study by English 
            Nature revealing that genes from separate GM varieties can accumulate 
            in plants that grow from seed spilled at harvest through a process 
            known as &quot;gene-stacking&quot; and (c) the recent admission by 
            the Executive that horizontal gene transfer from GM foods has taken 
            place under laboratory conditions.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2699</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Iain Anderson on 
            BBC Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament, while respecting the 
            right of BBC Radio Scotland to set its own schedules, notes the station's 
            intention to end this Spring the afternoon programme presented by 
            Iain Anderson; regrets the damage done to the programme over the last 
            year by constant managerial interference in a highly successful formula 
            which mixed classical and Celtic music, now allowing only the blandest 
            of contemporary music to be broadcast in the key afternoon slot; observes 
            in particular the damage that this did to audience numbers and to 
            the total air time given to Scottish music by the main, publicly-funded 
            Scottish broadcaster; is saddened that such a wrong-headed policy 
            was persisted with, despite much opinion to the contrary expressed 
            to the BBC by loyal listeners, and hopes that Iain Anderson&#146;s 
            new programme, to be broadcast on weekday evenings, will be left free 
            of such meddling and allowed to develop the style and content that 
            has made Iain Anderson deservedly popular with a very wide range of 
            listeners.</p>

            commends Children 1st, Childline, NCH Scotland and the other participants 
            for producing this report, and considers that the Scottish Executive

            projects may increase several fold between the selection of the &quot;preferred 
            bidder&quot; and the signing of the final contract and requests that

            Union draft directive on consolidated procurement which would ban 
            the selection of preferred bidders before a contract has been developed

          <p> <strong>S1M-2694#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Fife Council 
            and Third Age Group</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that it 
            is a matter of public record that Fife Council paid a total of £40,178 
            from 1998 to 1999 to the Third Age Centre in Glenrothes at a time 
            when it was no longer a properly constituted organisation; further 
            notes that the first employee of the Third Age Group was a serving 
            Fife Labour councillor, the second employee was a Labour activist 
            and that the Council's link worker with the Group was the election 
            agent to the MP, Henry McLeish; is concerned that all the papers relating 
            to the grant applications were shredded by the Council; considers 
            that the report of 4 December 2001 by Douglas Sinclair, the Council's 
            Chief Executive, which contained the following extracts&#151;</p>
          <p><em>"The Third Age Centre was a properly constituted voluntary organisation&#133;and 
            merited financial support from the Council"&#133;; "&#133;it would 
            appear that all normal procedures were followed when processing the 
            Group's applications for grant&quot;&#133;; &quot;&#133;it was necessary 
            to destroy the files as insufficient storage space was available"&#133;; 
            "&#133;that the Council's actions with regard to the Third Age Group 
            are beyond reproach"&#133; and "No further action requires to be taken."</em></p>
          <p>calls into question the ability of the Council to investigate this 
            matter further in a manner which will satisfy the people of Fife, 
            and therefore considers that Audit Scotland should carry out an investigation 
            as a matter of urgency which should consider the Council's conduct 
            in relation to the Third Age Centre during the period 1995 to 2000 
            when grant assistance was being paid and conduct a thorough review 
            of the practices currently employed by the Council.</p>
