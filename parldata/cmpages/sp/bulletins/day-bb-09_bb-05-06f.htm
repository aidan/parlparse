<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4069</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>World No Tobacco Day 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports World No Tobacco Day on 31 May; notes that Scotland has made a significant step to support smokers stopping through its ban on smoking in public places but recognises that more will need to be done to further reduce this public health challenge, and&nbsp;congratulates Dr Judith Longstaff Mackay, an Edinburgh graduate and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, on receiving the British Medical Journal Group&rsquo;s first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of her work in reducing smoking worldwide but especially across Asia in her role as&nbsp;&nbsp;senior&nbsp;&nbsp;policy&nbsp;&nbsp;advisor to the World Health Organization and World Lung Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4068</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Big in Falkirk, Another Big Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved with Big in Falkirk, Scotland&rsquo;s national street arts festival, held on 2 and 3 May 2009 and headlined by Stereo MCs and Capercaillie; notes that this event celebrated its 10th anniversary with street theatre, music, dance, the secret garden, an under 5&rsquo;s fun tent, a fringe tent and a major fireworks display, all in the beautiful surroundings of Callendar House, and looks forward to Big in Falkirk 2010.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4067</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>School Discipline</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the rise in the number of exclusions from Scottish schools attributable to weapon attacks by pupils; notes the growing concern expressed by teachers and parents that serious and persistent offenders are not being punished appropriately; calls on the Scottish Government to publish detailed information at regular intervals on the level of reported physical and verbal attacks in schools, as called for by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning when in opposition, and believes that the Scottish Government should devolve more power to head teachers to deal with indiscipline in schools.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4066</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to St Johnstone FC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Johnstone Football Club in capturing the First Division championship and wishes the club well on its deserved return to the Scottish Premier League next season.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4065</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Community Courts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the decision of the Scottish Government not to proceed with the establishment of a community court in Glasgow; recognises that community courts based on the New York City model in Midtown can address patterns of offending behaviour by providing for swift and effective summary justice coupled with a range of rehabilitation services to break the cycle of reoffending, and believes that the recent action taken by the Scottish Government demonstrates its incoherent approach towards addressing crime and the causes of crime and to providing viable and robust alternatives to custody.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4064</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>The Stockline Tragedy, Five Years On</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the fifth anniversary of the tragedy that occurred at the Stockline factory in Maryhill; offers its continued support to those injured or bereaved in the explosion and remembers the bravery and dedication of the emergency services and the contribution of the staff of the community central halls, and hopes that the outcome of Lord Gill&rsquo;s report into the circumstances of this incident will be that workplaces in Scotland become safer.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4063&diams; </strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Supporting the Living Wage for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish Living Wage Employer Awards being held in Dalmarnock; regrets the fact that there are around 700,000 workers in Scotland, the majority of them women, earning less than the Scottish living wage of &pound;7.00 per hour; is aware that low pay can lock people into poverty and can be damaging for individuals, families, businesses, communities and the wider economy, and recognises the importance of encouraging employers in the public, private and voluntary sectors to ensure that all low-paid workers are paid no less than the Scottish living wage of &pound;7.00 per hour.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4062</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill at Stage 1 be extended to 15 May 2009.</p>

<p>Supported by: Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong>, Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Elizabeth Smith<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-4003#</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Supporting Our Local Newspaper Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Local Newspaper Week, 11 to 17 May 2009, and recognises the crucial role played by Scotland&rsquo;s local newspapers in providing a news service to their local communities; particularly notes the work of northern papers, including <em>The Inverness Courier, Highland News, North Star, The Northern Scot, Ross-shire Journal and West Highland Free Press, </em>which serve, at times, a scattered and remote population; further notes the benefits to community engagement and the democratic process of the traditional local newspaper industry; acknowledges the increased pressures faced by the local newspaper industry due to falling circulation, loss of advertising revenue and increased competition from internet-based services, and considers that printed newspapers have served for centuries as a source of information on community affairs.</p>
