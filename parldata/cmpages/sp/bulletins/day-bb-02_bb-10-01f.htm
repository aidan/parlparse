<p><STRONG>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks

which members wish to be considered for debate as members&#146; business in the 
Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3444</STRONG> 
<STRONG>David Mundell: Integrated NHS in Dumfries and Galloway</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament recognises that there is not a &quot;one size fits all&quot; model 
for the organisation of the NHS in Scotland; welcomes the decision by the Minister 
for Health and Community Care to approve the plans by Dumfries and Galloway NHS 
Board for the integration of the three health organisations in Dumfries and Galloway 
which have received widespread staff and public support, and looks forward to 
a smooth transition to the new single organisation, which has many challenges 
to meet in delivering the best possible health services to people living throughout 
the many communities in Dumfries and Galloway, not least the retention and recruitment 
of staff.</P><P>Supported by: Alex Fergusson*</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3443</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Iain Smith: Fife Rail Services</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
the amended rail services in Fife introduced by the 2002-03 winter timetable; 
welcomes, in particular, the new 06:00 service from Dundee to Edinburgh and 18:42 
service from Edinburgh to Dundee, operated by Virgin Trains, which will help to 
increase travel opportunities and reduce overcrowding for passengers from north-east 
Fife, and calls on the train operating companies to continue to improve the rail 
service in Fife and, in particular, on ScotRail to restore the stop at Ladybank 
on the 08:49 service from Perth to Edinburgh.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3442</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh: Rise in Suicide Rates</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes with concern the rise in suicide rates and, in particular, the worrying 
rise in suicides amongst young people; commends the significant work that Facilitate 
(Scotland) has done in this area, providing counselling and support for those 
at risk from self-harm throughout Scotland and for their families, and notes that 
only strengthened communities and families will be able to support vulnerable 
people through personal crises, prevent those people from taking drastic action 
against themselves and enable them to regain control of their lives and their 
futures.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3441</STRONG> <STRONG>Michael Russell: Sale of Scottish 
Media Group Newspapers</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">agrees 
that the sale of the <em>Sunday Herald</em>, <em>The Herald</em> and the <em>Evening 
Times</em> to the Barclay brothers, current owners of <em>Scotland on Sunday</em>, 
<em>The Scotsman</em> and the <em>Edinburgh Evening News</em>, would be a completely 
unacceptable concentration of Scottish media ownership and grossly detrimental 
to the future of a diverse, free and vigorous Scottish media.</A><STRONG><em> R</em></STRONG></P><P>
