            Gallery of Modern Art, the aim of the initiative being to raise the

            on the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRAC2 and believes 
            that the patenting of genes can lead to a negative affect on the progress

          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-837</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: 
            Genetic Testing for Insurance Purposes</strong>-That the Parliament opposes

            the Genetic Advisory Insurance Committee review of the Association 
            of British Insurers code of practice on genetic testing, which currently 
            permits results for seven different conditions, including breast cancer,

          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-836</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:

            thanks Judith Church MP for her work as Secretary to the Westminster 
            All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Breast Cancer; welcomes Joan 
            Ruddock MP as the new APPG Secretary from June 2000, and is committed

            the Parliament commends the pensioners of Irvine for their vigorous 
            campaign against cuts to the provision of warden services to sheltered 
            housing complexes in North Ayrshire; supports the aims of their 700 
            signature petition, lodged with the Parliament's Public Petitions 
            Committee, which highlights the dangers which elderly people will 
            face if the warden service is removed at weekends and which rejects 
            the council's argument that community alarms are a substitute, particularly 
            given that the alarms, which were previously free for many pensioners, 
            are now to cost over £100 a year and urges the Scottish Executive 
            to undertake an enquiry into the provision of warden services nationally 
            and, pending this, expects North Ayrshire Council to take heed of 
            the strength of feeling in the local community and suspend plans to 
            cut back the service.</font></p>

            printed in italics in article 2 (3), be approved.</font></p>

            new four-lane bridge across the River Clyde with two lanes for exclusive 
            use by public transport; recognises that the proposed £8 million link 
            will provide essential road and pedestrian access to the Pacific Quay 
            development; notes that the former Garden Festival site is of strategic 
            importance to Glasgow and Scotland in terms of attracting and housing 
            digital technology and cutting edge media businesses, leading to the 
            economic regeneration of much of Glasgow's former dockland, and calls

            be investigated and that a policy to protect and preserve allotment 
            holdings throughout Scotland, particularly in Edinburgh, should be 
            developed and calls upon the Scottish Executive to report to the Parliament 
            on this issue.</font></p>

            Scottish Homing Union and other pigeon fanciers in Scotland on the 
            impact that raptors are having on their sport, and believes that the 
            Scottish Executive and all interested parties should work together 
            to ensure the appropriate protection of both raptors and racing pigeons 
            so as to enable the continuation of pigeon racing as a sport in Scotland.</a></font></p>
