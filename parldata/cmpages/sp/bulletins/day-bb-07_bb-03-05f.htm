<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5687</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Scottish Drugs Forum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Drugs Forum for its very successful conference on 28 February 2007 on drug use and hepatitis C in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to make itself fully aware of the key issues raised at the conference and, in particular, the increased incidence of hepatitis C among people under 40, and further calls on the Executive to ensure that advice on harm reduction and treatment for hepatitis C is easily accessible through a variety of media, taking into consideration all levels of literacy and understanding in any risk group.</p>
<p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5685</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie on behalf of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill Committee:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill be passed.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5684</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie on behalf of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill Committee:</strong> <strong>3rd Report, 2007 (Session 2) of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill Committee, Report on the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill and European Protected Species</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 3rd Report, 2007 of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill Committee, <em>Report on the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill and European Protected Species</em> (SP Paper 737), and agrees that the construction of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link project should not impact on the favourable conservation status of otters.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5683</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie on behalf of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill Committee:</strong> <strong>2nd Report, 2007 (Session 2) of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill Committee, Appropriate Assessment Report on the Firth of Forth Special Protection Area</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 2nd Report, 2007 (Session 2) of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill Committee, <em>Appropriate Assessment Report on the Firth of Forth Special Protection Area</em> (SP Paper 736), and agrees that the construction of the project proposed in the Bill will not adversely affect the integrity of the Firth of Forth Special Protection Area.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5682*#*</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Ending of Exemptions for Water and Sewerage Charges for Smaller Voluntary Organisations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the position of the Scottish Executive, as detailed in its <em>Consultation Analysis of the Non-Household Water Charges - Changes to The Current Charging Arrangement, </em>that it has no plans to extend beyond 2010 the exemption from water and sewerage charges granted to smaller voluntary organisations, or to establish a replacement for it when it expires; further believes that the ending of the exemption will place very considerable financial pressure on smaller voluntary organisations and churches in Ayrshire and across Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should extend the present exemption arrangements beyond 2010.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5680</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Slavery Still Thriving 200 Years On</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with dismay the latest findings of a report by the University of Hull and Anti-Slavery International for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that, 200 years after a Parliamentary Bill was passed on 25 March 1807 to abolish the slave trade in the former British Empire, modern day slavery is still thriving today in Britain and throughout the world; notes that 2.4 million people, half of them children, are being sold into slavery every year according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and that an estimated 12 million people may be working as slaves; notes that the researchers found that trafficking into the United Kingdom for sexual or domestic labour involves hundreds or even thousands of women and children and that some children, in particular those from African countries, are trafficked through the UK to other countries; notes that the ILO and UNICEF suggest that in 2004 some 218 million children were trapped in child labour worldwide and, of these, by 2006 some 171 million were engaged in hazardous work including in factories, mines and agriculture; notes also that in 2003 an estimated 3 to 4.5 million people were living in the European Union without legal papers, with an estimated 400,000 people a year being trafficked into member states; supports the report&rsquo;s recommendations for national action to be complemented by international law and collaborative action, policy and service responses which regard those in slavery as victims first and foremost, a more robust stance against the exploiters and proper resources for enforcement agencies, and notes that, since the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, there has yet to be a single prosecution brought for trafficking for labour exploitation.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5676</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Reporting and Dealing with Intimidation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive, local authorities, health authorities, the fire and ambulance authorities, all organisations and firms in the retail industry, all the trade unions involved in all these areas of work and the police first to combine in a major campaign to ensure that all incidents of violence towards, or intimidation or harassment of, staff are reported and catalogued and then, based on this more accurate information, to launch a sustained nationwide campaign to stamp out the unacceptable abuse, threats and violence towards people who are trying to fulfil their task of serving the public, and calls for a simultaneous campaign to work with young people, families, schools, youth and community organisations and the police to report bullying, intimidation or harassment of young people by gangs or individuals and to co-operate in supporting people who have been bullied, responding more quickly to incidents, getting the bullies to behave better and providing all young people with more positive recreational opportunities.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5674</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of Israeli Occupation Forces&rsquo; Actions in Nablus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the actions of the Israeli occupation forces in occupying the West Bank town of Nablus and subjecting it to a curfew over the last three days which has resulted in an estimated 50,000 people being confined to their homes as Israeli troops invade houses and harass civilians; notes that in addition An-Najah National University and all schools have been closed and students instructed to remain in their homes, while Israeli occupation forces have also stormed hospitals preventing employees, ambulances and paramedics from accessing the hospitals, thus compromising patient care; further notes that at least four Palestinians have been killed in these raids, bringing to 5,647 the number of people killed since the start of the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000, the vast majority of these being Palestinians; views Israel&rsquo;s actions as an attempt to destroy any prospects for a peaceful resolution to the current conflict by sabotaging the formation of a Palestinian national unity government, and calls on Israel to respect the sovereignty of the West Bank and Gaza and to halt all such raids.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5673</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>&pound;110 Billion Real Cost of Trident</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the findings of the House of Commons Defence Committee which heard that the price of a new Trident system would not be between &pound;15 billion and &pound;20 billion, as stated in the Government&rsquo;s white paper, but that the total cost of maintaining and replacing Britain&rsquo;s nuclear weapons would be between &pound;90 billion and &pound;110 billion; believes that, as a result, people have been misinformed as to the real cost of replacing Trident, further adding weight to the overwhelming arguments against replacement, and considers that this should serve to persuade those members in favour of replacement to reappraise their support and to help those members who have not expressed where they stand on this important issue to make a more informed decision.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5663</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Save Meadowbank Stadium</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the proposed demolition of Meadowbank Stadium, home to the Commonwealth Games of 1970 and 1986; notes that stadia in Berlin, Helsinki, Stockholm and Los Angeles have all been successfully refurbished and all are older than Meadowbank Stadium; notes that the proposed transfer of the stadium to Sighthill would mean that two running tracks, the other at nearby Saughton, would sit on the west of the city, while stadium users from eastern and central Edinburgh would be expected to make a round journey of up to 12 miles and users from East Lothian would largely be excluded on the grounds of travel time and travel expense; rejects the loss of Scotland&rsquo;s sporting heritage, Meadowbank having been home to Liz McColgan&rsquo;s first Commonwealth title in 1986 and Lachie Stewart&rsquo;s Commonwealth 10,000 metres victory over Ron Clarke in 1970 to name but two iconic performances, as well as being the training ground of Yvonne Murray, former European 3,000 metres Champion; notes that Meadowbank Stadium is home to Edinburgh Southern Harriers, currently the best women&rsquo;s athletics club in the United Kingdom, having won last season&rsquo;s UK League, a most notable feat for a Scottish club; notes the concerns of football clubs that use Sighthill Park for training; notes the objections of thousands of users, who have signed an ongoing petition, as well as coaches and their athletes who fear loss of facilities at a vital time in their preparations for 2012 Olympics and 2014 Commonwealth Games; notes that the current public consultation does not extend to whether or not local people want the stadium demolished but only consults on ideas for the site when demolition is complete; rejects the logic that new facilities can only be funded by the sell-off of existing facilities; notes that this proposal is at odds with need to tackle Scotland&rsquo;s appalling health record and growing obesity problem, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to work with the Scottish Executive to restore the neglected stadium as it is part of our national sporting heritage.</p>
