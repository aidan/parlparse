         <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2554</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Infrastructure Investment Plan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the record level of infrastructure investment, as set out in the first infrastructure plan for Scotland,<em> Building a Better Scotland: Infrastructure Investment Plan: Investing in the Future of Scotland</em>; acknowledges that the plan addresses the problems bequeathed by decades of underinvestment; recognises that the Scottish Executive is open to working across the public and private sectors in order to ensure that Scotland has the modern infrastructure that is necessary to support economic growth and secure an improved quality of life for the people of Scotland, and agrees that the infrastructure plan will deliver, for the long term, better public services, improved transport infrastructure, modernised colleges and universities, new hospitals, improved housing and new schools.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2553#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Action on Skin Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the stigma, frustration and desperation felt by many people with skin disease, including residents in East Renfrewshire; points out that conditions such as psoriasis are lifelong and incurable but are eminently treatable; highlights the benefit of having skin disease classified as a chronic condition; raises concern that skin disease is not a priority under the new GP contract; welcomes the new provision of specialist retraining in skin disease for nurses but points to the need for similar training for other health professionals such as pharmacists and GPs, given that 20% of GP consultations include skin disease, including an emphasis on skin conditions in the undergraduate education and training of health professionals; approves the Skin Action Scotland service redesign programme as an opportunity for clinicians to test new ways of accessing and delivering dermatology out-patient services and to better demonstrate and define the current relationship between demand and capacity, and looks to see greater availability to patients of new treatments with strong evidence of effectiveness such as the new biological treatments for psoriasis and the complications of arthritis.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2552#</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Stamp Duty Rebate Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes &quot;Homestake&quot;, the initiative announced by the Scottish Executive intended to help first-time buyers purchase property in Scotland; notes, however, that a recent Bank of Scotland survey showed that the average price paid for a house in Scotland by first-time buyers is now &pound;82,654 and that the average stamp duty is &pound;820; further notes that the stamp duty threshold has not risen from &pound;60,000 since 1994 but that, if it had, the threshold would now be &pound;156,000, and therefore calls on the Executive to consider a scheme that would discount the first &pound;1,000 of council tax paid within the year of purchase, a figure which equates to a stamp duty rebate on property valued at &pound;100,000 and draws the Executive&rsquo;s attention to the benefit that could accrue to over 30,000 house buyers and that it would cost the Executive just over &pound;30 million.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2551</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Lebanon Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with incredulity comments made by US President, George Bush, in his weekly radio address of 7 March 2005 in relation to Lebanon &quot;that Lebanon&rsquo;s sovereignty be respected, that all foreign forces be withdrawn, and that free and fair elections be conducted without foreign influence&quot;; further notes that Iraq has recently conducted an election under the barrel of the guns of armies of occupation of the United States of America and the United Kingdom; believes that the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, permitted the Bush administration to shift attention from its Iraq failure to Syria&rsquo;s presence in Lebanon, just as the US invasion of Iraq shifted attention from President Bush&rsquo;s failure to capture Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, and believes that President Bush&rsquo;s remarks are further evidence of the US Government&rsquo;s rank hypocrisy in relation to foreign policy and that any advice from President Bush has no credibility whatsoever.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2550</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Stirling Council&rsquo;s Neglect of Stirling&rsquo;s Roads</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent Accounts Commission report, <em>Stirling Council - The Audit of Best Value and Community Planning</em>, which states: &quot;The Council&rsquo;s road network is in a serious state of disrepair following years of under-investment. Stirling is one of only four councils where more than 20% of the roads network has deteriorated to a point at which it needs resurfacing to prolong future life. The Council has chosen to spend less than half its GAE allocation on roads maintenance. This makes it one of only three councils spending such a small amount&quot;; further notes that previous reports, <em>Maintaining Scotland&rsquo;s roads</em> by Audit Scotland and the Scottish Road Maintenance Condition survey for 2003-04 carried out by consultant engineers for the Society of Chief Officers of Transport also found Stirling&rsquo;s roads to be in an unacceptable state and that Stirling Council&rsquo;s own residents&rsquo; survey in 2002 showed that 58% of those taking part were dissatisfied with the level of roads servicing; understands that Stirling Council has chosen to spend less than half its GAE allocation on roads maintenance and that, while the sum Stirling Council has allocated in 2004-05 for roads maintenance is &pound;2.3 million, the council itself has estimated that returning Stirling&rsquo;s roads network to an average condition would cost in excess of &pound;13 million, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that Stirling Council&rsquo;s Labour administration addresses its neglect of Stirling&rsquo;s roads as a matter of urgency.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2549</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>NHS Dentistry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about Scotland&rsquo;s poor dental health record; notes that only 3.5% of dentists anticipate increasing their NHS provision in the foreseeable future; recognises that if access to NHS dentistry is not improved, then the commitment to provide universal free oral health assessments by 2007 may not be met, and therefore believes that, in order to meet this pledge and safeguard the future of NHS dentistry, the Scottish Executive must provide incentives for dentists to undertake more preventive work including a significant increase in the fee level for oral health assessments, assist dentists more with infrastructure costs in return for greater NHS commitment, reduce bureaucracy and simplify the current fee scale and expand the number of NHS salaried dentists and address dental workforce shortages by increasing the number of dental undergraduates and expanding the role and number of professionals complementary to dentistry.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2548#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>McCowan&rsquo;s of Stenhousemuir in Receivership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that McCowan&rsquo;s of Stenhousemuir has gone into receivership with the resultant threat to over 80 jobs; recognises the quality of the workforce who have helped to make McCowan&rsquo;s a leading name in the Scottish confectionery industry, and considers that the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise Forth Valley should offer every possible assistance to ensure the continuation of the company&rsquo;s production at Stenhousemuir with the retention of as many jobs as possible.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2547</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Early Years Education and Childcare</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vital role of early years education and the importance of quality, accessible childcare in stimulating children&rsquo;s development and supporting working families in particular and the wider economy and society generally; notes with concern the delay in the publication of the national strategy for early years with provision for a national settlement for nursery nurses from the Scottish Executive; supports the immediate extension of free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to a full half day from the current part-time provision and the extension of &quot;nurture groups&quot; across Scotland for vulnerable young pupils, and recognises, however, that in order for Scotland to be able to shape and deliver&nbsp;comprehensive early education and child care the Scottish government needs to have powers over tax and benefits in order to provide a universal entitlement to emulate the provision of Scandinavian countries who spend four times the proportion of their GDP in support of children in the early years as Scotland.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2546</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>More Funding for Smoking Cessation Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of National No Smoking Day in helping to motivate smokers to give up smoking; recognises that if they are to be successful in stopping smoking altogether then many smokers require the assistance of smoking cessation services; congratulates all those who work in the cessation services on helping smokers end their addiction to tobacco; believes that funding for these services remains inadequate in the face of the tobacco industries&rsquo; efforts to hold on to their current customers and recruit new smokers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase the funding to smoking cessation services as part of the preparation to ban smoking in public places in 2006.</p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2544#</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Hannah Research Institute - Loss of Home Based Scientists</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views with concern the loss of scientists and support staff as a consequence of uncertainties over research funding currently surrounding the Hannah Research Institute near Ayr; considers that the actions of the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department over recent times have been unhelpful and misleading when considering the research direction that the Institute has followed; believes that the levels of expertise and knowledge available within Hannah are identical to those that the Executive seeks to recruit under its Fresh Talent initiative and retain, if its much-used phrase of &quot;a Smart Successful Scotland&quot; has any meaning, and considers that the Ministers for Enterprise, Health and Rural Affairs should come together to secure the future of this quality Scottish resource.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2543#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Depopulation Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the growing crisis of depopulation that Scotland is facing with more and more young Scots choosing to relocate to countries abroad which offer better economic and social benefits than is the case at home; expresses disappointment that Scottish ministers do not appear to have any contingency plans in place in the event of all-out failure of the Fresh Talent initiative; notes further that the far-right immigration policies being developed by both Conservative and Labour parties at UK level will further exacerbate Scotland&rsquo;s population crisis; notes the comments of First Minister, Jack McConnell, that the high levels of outward migration have only been a factor in Scotland for two centuries, and under union with England; believes that members of the Parliament should consider all of the potential options on offer which would retain our existing youth potential whilst attracting growing numbers of foreign workers to Scotland, and notes that the annual targets set by ministers for attracting fresh talent to Scotland are hopelessly low and that independent opinion has stated as a matter of public record that Scotland needs somewhere in the region of 60,000-plus new workers settling in the country in order to ensure we have a sustainable public service infrastructure and growing private business sector in the years to come.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2542</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>21 April 2005 - Anniversary of Mordechai Vanunu&rsquo;s Release from Prison</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the broad support in Scotland for the human rights of Mordechai Vanunu, who was imprisoned by the Israeli government for 18 years for exposing Israel&rsquo;s nuclear weapons programme and is currently under house arrest and denied access to foreign media; notes that, since his election as Rector of the University of Glasgow, many more people have become aware of his case; congratulates Vanunu for his sustained opposition to weapons of mass destruction and his support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state; further notes that the Israeli Supreme Court will review the restrictions placed on Vanunu on 21 April 2005, the anniversary of his release from prison, and firmly believes that, having served 18 years in prison, Vanunu should be released from all restrictions and be given the freedom to serve as the Rector of the University of Glasgow.</p>
