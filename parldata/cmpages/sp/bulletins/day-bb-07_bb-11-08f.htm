          <p><strong>*S3M-801</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Day Care Workers and Learning Disabled Adults</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament shares the concern of Glasgow MSPs Bob Doris, Sandra White, Bill Kidd and Bashir Ahmad regarding the future staffing and service provision for learning disabled adults in Glasgow; notes the ongoing strike by Glasgow City Council day care workers who care for such adults in the city and sympathises with their concerns regarding their new contracts as a result of single status negotiations, and believes that the council must clearly show a pathway for each worker to be lifted out of pay detriment by March 2009, when salary conservation ends, and that the current proposals to reorganise learning disabled services must both meet the needs of the learning disabled clients, their families and at-home carers as well as acknowledging and supporting the ongoing professionalism of learning disabled staff who are currently suffering hardship as a result of industrial action that they have reluctantly taken.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-800</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Cross Party Report on Leukaemia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the report of the Westminster cross-party inquiry into childhood leukaemia and electric and magnetic fields (EMFs), which investigated the effects of EMFs, such as those caused by power lines, on the incidence of leukaemia in childhood; further notes the forthcoming Health Protection Agency report on the same topic; recognises that a debate is ongoing in the scientific community with rigorous, peer-reviewed epidemiological papers on both sides; expresses concern that the International Agency for Research on Cancer has therefore classified EMFs as &quot;possibly carcinogenic&quot;; observes with caution ongoing developments such as the Beauly to Denny power line that will place new EMFs in close proximity to existing settlements and would therefore not comply with the moratorium proposed in the cross-party report<em>;</em> expresses support for the precautionary principle in relation to what may plausibly be significant threats to life, and calls on the Minister for Public Health to work with relevant stakeholders to investigate this problem, to address and act on concerns and to adequately safeguard Scotland&rsquo;s citizens from this risk.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-799</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Lochview Nursery, Easterhouse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lochview Nursery, Easterhouse, on its stunning success and achievement in gaining an outstanding HMIE inspection report and recognises that the first-class educational opportunities that exist within Easterhouse demonstrate the quality of local provision and the commitment and leadership of local staff and the local community.</p>
