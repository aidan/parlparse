<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#fend">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5331</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>EU REACH Legislation on Toxic Chemicals in Manufacturing and Products</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the European Parliament has approved the EU Council&rsquo;s Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) legislation on the regulation of toxic chemicals in the environment; is concerned at reports of intense lobbying at EU level by chemicals industries and the watering down of initial proposals, including those for the substitution of the most hazardous chemicals; is concerned that chemicals that cause cancer, reproductive disorders, birth defects and hormonal disturbances will continue be used in manufacturing and in consumer goods, despite the availability of safer alternatives; is concerned that there will be an increase in testing chemicals on animals; is concerned that, since the chemicals industry can continue to invoke commercial confidentiality, consumers will continue to have &quot;no right to know&quot; which chemicals are contained in products; recognises that legal loopholes and provisions for self-regulation contained in the new measures leave REACH open to the possibility of manipulation by chemicals industries; believes that the development and work of a new EU chemicals agency in Helsinki must be completely independent of the chemicals industry and closely monitored during implementation of REACH to ensure that the presence of toxic chemicals in the environment is reduced to minimise contamination of people and wildlife, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use its influence at UK and EU level to ensure that this is achieved.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5330</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Discrimination Doesn&rsquo;t Work</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of disability charity, Leonard Cheshire, which recently conducted research into discrimination in recruitment in Scotland; further notes that the report shows that many disabled people still face discrimination in the labour market and that employers were twice as likely to discriminate in favour of a non-disabled applicant; agrees with Leonard Cheshire that there needs to be further research conducted into this issue to develop new ways of engaging with employers to find positive and pro-active ways to reverse the findings of this report, and urges all MSPs to raise awareness of the issues raised by Leonard Cheshire among their constituents, especially local employers, to ensure that equality prevails in Scotland&rsquo;s employment markets.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5329</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Label Scotch in Gaelic</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that&nbsp;EU institutions are currently dealing with a legislative proposal aimed at updating European rules relating to the labelling of spirit drinks; further notes that under the proposal legal recognition is given to the terms &quot;Irish Whiskey&quot; and &quot;Uisce Beatha Eireannach/Irish Whiskey&quot;; considers that it would be appropriate for the Scottish Gaelic term &quot;Uisge-beatha Albannach&quot; to be given similar protection as is already afforded to its Irish equivalent, particularly given the recent legislation giving Gaelic official status in Scots law, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to work alongside the whisky industry, Gaelic language bodies and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to ensure that full EU legal status is given to Scotland&rsquo;s national drink in our national languages.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5328</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Betting Shop Staff Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that betting shops are among the few high street establishments in which cash handling is growing; further notes that, as a result, staff in Scottish betting shops are subject to risk of robbery and assault on a daily basis; believes that this risk is significantly increased due to longer opening hours and single-staffing of betting shops; notes that, in a survey of betting shop staff by Community, the union representing UK betting shop staff, 78% reported that they were concerned that they would become a victim of crime at work, and therefore welcomes the campaign recently launched by Community to end single-staffing and improve security in betting shops.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5327</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Bring Back Our Buses Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that several vital community bus services in the Edinburgh area have been cut or made virtually unaffordable through fare increases over the last year; applauds the efforts of the South Queensferry Bus Users&rsquo; Group in campaigning for affordable fares and of the &quot;Bring Back our Buses&quot; campaign in calling for the retention of frequent services on the 13, 18, 38 routes and the reinstatement of full services on the 67, 20 and 60 routes, which are much used by OAPs and other vulnerable members of excluded communities in Blackhall, Ratho, Dumbiedykes, Wester Hailes and Pilton, and believes that local authorities should be allowed to regulate bus routes and timetables to ensure that marginalised communities are able to access services and amenities.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5326</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Shelter - Homeless Children at Christmas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern Shelter Scotland&rsquo;s estimate that almost 5,000 children will be in temporary accommodation this Christmas and that, despite a three-year-old Scottish Executive pledge, reported in the <em>Daily Record</em>, that there would be no homeless children in bed and breakfast hotels at Christmas, there are still councils using unsuitable accommodation for children at this time of year.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Roseanna Cunningham<strong>*</strong>, Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5325&diams;</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Demonstrate in Falkirk: Not a Minute on the Day, Not a Penny off the Pay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses support for all trade unionists and supporters attending the national demonstration in Falkirk on Saturday 16 December 2006 for equal pay and against cuts in pay, terms and conditions and services and draconian imposition of contracts through implementation of single status in local authorities without reaching negotiated agreement with trade unions; affirms commitment to the achievement of equal pay through levelling up, not down; reiterates its belief that the Scottish Executive should make sufficient funding available to meet the full value of women&rsquo;s equal pay claims and to implement single status fairly; notes that the Executive is prepared to give handouts to business totalling at least &pound;280 million over two years in business rate cuts; considers that this is insulting to all local authority workers and those reliant on their services; considers it unacceptable that workers should have to demonstrate on the streets, take industrial action and resort to the courts to obtain what is rightfully and lawfully theirs while business needs only to hold out its hand, and believes that the Executive and local authorities must now do much more to settle the issues around single status and equal pay if they are to avoid further unrest and disruption in the run-up to the May 2007 election.</p>
<p>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5323</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>A Dog is for Life</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the sterling work of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA); notes that from January to November this year a record number of 4,956 dogs were abandoned and taken into SSPCA kennels, with 324 currently in *care*; further notes that the SSPCA currently has no kennel space available; notes that the society is even receiving abusive calls from dog owners who, in the run-up to Christmas, seek to abandon their dogs, and therefore urges the Scottish government to support the SSPCA in its call to the public not to buy pets for Christmas presents, many of which are abandoned once the tree and the tinsel are down.</p>
