            to publish full details of its proposed legislation without delay 
            and to explain in detail to the people of Scotland why such legislation 
            is necessary in terms of the European Convention on Human Rights and 
            the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and to ensure that the 
            emphasis in any such legislation is on helping parents by means of 
            educative change rather than applying punitive sanctions. </p>

            Week, Scotland: 7-14 September 2001</strong>&#151;That the Parliament pledges 
            its support for Men&#146;s Health Week, Scotland, from 7 to 14 September 
            2001; acknowledges the collaboration between Men&#146;s Health Forum 
            Scotland, health boards, the business sector, community health initiatives 
            and the voluntary sector to publicise Men&#146;s Health Week, Scotland; 
            recognises that the majority of factors which impact negatively on 
            men&#146;s health are preventable; notes that 75% of suicides are 
            male and almost 60% of premature male deaths are from coronary heart 
            disease and cancer, yet men attend their GPs less than half as often 
            as women; further notes that co-ordinated efforts are necessary to 
            ensure that men take responsibility for their health and that services 
            commit themselves to the challenge of working with men, and believes 
            that MSPs should support the collaboration by promoting positive messages 
            about men&#146;s health and Men&#146;s Health Week, Scotland, thereby 
            encouraging more men to take responsibility for their own health and 
            well-being. </p>
