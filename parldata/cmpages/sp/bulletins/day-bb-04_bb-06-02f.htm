          <p><strong>*S2M-1397</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Gulf 
            War Syndrome</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its deep concern 
            for Mr Alexander Izett, 34, a Scottish veteran of the first Gulf War, 
            who has been on hunger strike since 1 May 2004 to demand an independent 
            public inquiry into the causes and medical treatment of Gulf War Syndrome; 
            notes that, in preparation for deployment, he received nine vaccinations 
            in 24 hours, and that since 1993 he has suffered ill-health, including 
            autoimmune osteoporosis which a 2003 court ruling found was caused 
            by this &quot;concoction of drugs&quot;; further notes that many other 
            veterans have suffered similar ill-health and even death, and calls 
            on Her Majesty's Government to set up an independent public inquiry 
            into all aspects of Gulf War Syndrome.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1396</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Mordechai 
            Vanunu and Israel's Secret Nuclear Weapons Programme</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns the Israeli Government's treatment of Mordechai 
            Vanunu who was released from prison on 21 April 2004 after being held 
            in prison for 18 years, 11 of which were in solitary confinement, 
            for revealing the existence of the Israeli secret nuclear weapons 
            programme; furthermore strongly opposes restrictions placed upon Mr 
            Vanunu by the Israeli Government whereby Mr Vanunu is not allowed 
            to leave the country, visit any embassy or speak to foreigners or 
            media; believes that it is ironic that Mr Vanunu was jailed for exposing 
            secret weapons of mass destruction whilst Iraq was attacked and occupied 
            for supposedly not revealing weapons of mass destruction; considers 
            that the First Minister should write to Ariel Sharon inviting Mr Vanunu 
            to Scotland, a safe haven where he can live in freedom and safety 
            having suffered long enough as a result of his brave stance in relation 
            to weapons of mass destruction and the Israeli Government's secret 
            programme; notes that should Mr Vanunu reach these shores it would 
            not be appropriate to hold him in Dungavel House Immigration and Removal 
            Centre, and supports the Scottish Socialist Party in taking this initiative 
            if the First Minister feels that for any reason he cannot.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1395</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Economy 
            of the Highlands and Islands</strong>-That the Parliament endorses 
            the ambition to create a diverse, dynamic and sustainable economy 
            in the Highlands and Islands; congratulates Highlands and Islands 
            Enterprise on the progress it has made with local partners towards 
            realising this ambition, particularly in the areas of telecommunications, 
            research and development and renewable energy; further welcomes the 
            significant investment in critical transport infrastructure in the 
            Highlands and Islands; recognises that serious challenges still lie 
            ahead for the Highlands and Islands economy, not least in terms of 
            sustaining more fragile areas, but believes that these can best be 
            addressed through continuing the approach set out in <em>A Smart, 
            Successful Scotland</em>.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1394</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> 
            <strong>SPL Rejection of Inverness Caledonian Thistle</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns the decision by the Scottish Premier League 
            (SPL) to reject the application of Inverness Caledonian Thistle to 
            join the SPL; further condemns its action in previous years in preventing 
            Falkirk Football Club from entering the SPL; believes that this decision 
            brings Scottish football into disrepute by offending the basic principle 
            of advancement on merit, and calls on the SPL to reconsider its decision 
            and agree to Inverness Caledonian Thistle joining the SPL in the coming 
            season and to the lifting of 10,000 seat stadium criterion so allowing 
            home games to be played in Inverness.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1393</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Bank 
            of Scotland Midnightleague</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Bank of Scotland on sponsoring the Midnightleague Initiative, 
            which takes place on Fridays from early evening until midnight and 
            provides qualified coaches in conjunction with the Scottish Football 
            Association, local authorities and the police to run five and seven-a-side 
            football teams for young people aged between 12 and 16; acknowledges 
            the excellent progress that the league has made in encouraging young 
            people to be interested in football and teaching them football skills, 
            and welcomes the contribution the initiative has made to channelling 
            young people's energies into positive pursuits and tackling youth 
            crime.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1392</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Inverness 
            Caledonian Thistle Football Club</strong>-That the Parliament regrets 
            the decision that Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC loses out in its 
            bid to ground-share with Aberdeen Football Club and as a result is 
            denied promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL), despite winning 
            the Scottish Football League First Division Championship; notes the 
            SPL's in-principle agreement for clubs elsewhere in Scotland to ground-share; 
            further notes that the SPL is currently reviewing rules on stadia 
            criteria; urges the SPL to give clubs a sufficient opportunity to 
            fulfil such criteria, and calls for fair treatment for all clubs and 
            their supporters across Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1390</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of 
            the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Office of the Clerk</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees that between 8 January 2005 and 2 September 
            2005, the Office of the Clerk shall be open all days except: Saturdays 
            and Sundays, 25 and 28 March, and 2, 27 and 30 May 2005.</P>

            Situation</strong>-That the Parliament reaffirms its support for the 
            United Nations and its belief in the primacy of international law; 
            believes that the war in Iraq was both illegal and based on a deception

            that as a consequence the world is now a more dangerous place; notes 
            that the unstable security situation and the current rules of engagement 
            within Iraq have led to the coalition forces being seen as an army 
            of occupation, and believes, therefore, that to promote future stability

            from Iraq immediately; considers that the decision to invade Iraq 
            was based on lies, deceit and distortion and that President George 
            W Bush and Tony Blair are guilty of wilful deception in relation to 
            weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi links to the September 11 atrocity 
            and Iraq posing an imminent &quot;45-minute&quot; threat to British 
            interests; further considers that the invasion of Iraq was illegal 
            under international law and the continued presence of coalition troops 
            represents an illegal occupation; believes that the billions of pounds 
            committed to waging war in Iraq should be diverted to agencies like 
            the Red Cross, Red Crescent, M&eacute;dicins Sans Fronti&egrave;res 
            and others to assist in the rebuilding of Iraq's infrastructure with

            will be only secured on the basis of a free and viable Palestine requiring 
            the withdrawal of Israel from Palestinian territory; further believes 
            that Scotland's name should be synonymous with peaceful resolution

            2003; reaffirms its support for the United Nations and its belief

            saw fit to take this country into the Iraq War without United Nations 
            sanction or credible evidence of a significant threat to the safety 
            of the United Kingdom or of the world community; believes that as 
            a consequence the world is now a more dangerous place; notes with 
            concern the deteriorating security situation in Iraq and the Middle 
            East; believes that progress in Iraq is only possible if the role 
            of the United Nations is expanded and enhanced and the transfer of 
            sovereignty to the Iraqis on 30 June 2004 is real and visible; recalls 
            that when the House of Commons endorsed military action against Saddam 
            Hussein it did so on an understanding that progress on the road map 
            for a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians would be 
            a priority for Her Majesty's Government; expresses its disappointment

            solution more difficult and less likely; recognises the bravery and 
            professionalism of British armed forces serving in Iraq in difficult 
            and dangerous circumstances; calls upon Her Majesty's Government not 
            to commit any further troops unless requested by United Kingdom commanders 
            in Iraq for the purposes of securing the safety of British forces 
            and the fulfilling of Britain's international obligations towards 
            the people of Iraq and to the United Nations, and further declares

            and regional organisations, for the people of Iraq in their efforts 
            to achieve security; welcomes the ongoing efforts of the Special Advisor 
            to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to assist the people 
            of Iraq in achieving the formation of a sovereign interim government 
            of Iraq and the end of the occupation by 30 June 2004; affirms the 
            importance of the principles of the rule of law, including respect 
            for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and of democracy, including 
            free and fair elections no later than 31 January 2005; notes the report

            especially for upcoming elections, and to provide security for the 
            United Nations presence in Iraq; recognises the importance of the 
            consent of the sovereign government of Iraq for the presence of the 
            multinational force after 30 June and of close co-ordination between 
            the multinational force and that government, and acknowledges that 
            the United Nations should play a leading role in assisting the Iraqi 
            people in particular in the formation of institutions for representative 
            government.&quot;</P>
