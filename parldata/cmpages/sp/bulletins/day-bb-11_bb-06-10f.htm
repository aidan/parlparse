<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>*S4M-00270 Drew Smith: Kids Go Free on Glasgow Subway</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) that children are to be given free access to the Glasgow Subway for the period of the school summer holidays; hopes that many Glasgow families as well as those from further afield will make use of the Kids Go Free scheme, which will provide free journeys for up two children under 16 with a paying adult, allowing them to travel between many of Glasgow&rsquo;s excellent attractions including the new Riverside Museum, which will open later this month; congratulates SPT on its initiative, and hopes that another generation of Glasgow youngsters grow up to love the subway and that they continue to make use of the new modernised system for which the SPT has secured funding.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00269 Jim Eadie: Parentline Scotland Extended Service </strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the launch of ParentLine Scotland&rsquo;s weekend service, enabling anyone with a concern about a child to call 0800 028 2233 for support, advice and information on Saturdays and Sundays between 12 noon and 5 pm; notes that the extended service has been made possible through Scottish Government funding for a national kinship care service that allows CHILDREN 1ST and ParentLine Scotland to offer specialist emotional and practical help and advice to family members and friends raising and caring for children when their parents can no longer do so; further notes that CHILDREN 1ST has operated ParentLine Scotland since 1999, during which time 113,000 calls have been made and over 300 volunteers have been trained to listen, help and support callers, and calls on members to support ParentLine Scotland by promoting its service to families all over Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00268 Jenny Marra: Royal Bank of Scotland Local Branch Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Royal Bank of Scotland has heavily publicised its commitment to local branches and Scottish communities; condemns its decision to close its branch in Lochee, Dundee, after 150 years in the community; questions the reasoning provided of reduced footfall in the bank when it understands that it is company policy to reduce footfall in every branch by encouraging customers to take up telephone and digital banking; questions the Royal Bank of Scotland&rsquo;s customer service for its older customers and those without ready access to telephone and internet facilities and how the bank plans to serve these customers, and queries its planned provisions for over-the-counter services in Dundee now that the Lochee and Ninewells branches will close.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00267 Paul Martin: Primary Seven Pupils at St Philomena&rsquo;s Primary School in Provanmill, Business Breakfast</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the primary seven pupils at St Philomena&rsquo;s Primary School in Provanmill for successfully hosting Business Breakfast; welcomes the innovative way that the event engaged local businesses and taught useful skills to the participating pupils; further welcomes creative events like this that showcase the entrepreneurial spirit among local youngsters, and believes that skills learnt early will become useful for pupils&rsquo; future business pursuits.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00266 Roderick Campbell: University of St Andrews, Soaring to the Clouds</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the achievements in cloud computing research made by the University of St Andrews&rsquo; team at its School of Computer Science; considers the team to be a world leader in this field and welcomes the progress that it has made; believes that cloud computing represents a new way for organisations to transform their IT provision by potentially rendering costly software, servers and air conditioning systems redundant; believes that the use of web-based services as an alternative to traditional software has the potential to save the private and public sector millions of pounds per annum, and acknowledges the fact that the University of St Andrews is home to the first research centre in the United Kingdom dedicated to the cloud computing phenomenon.</p>
