              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S2M-1727.3</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Holyrood Inquiry Report</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1727) in the name of Robert Brown, leave out from &quot;and invites&quot; to end and insert &quot;; agrees with the key findings of the report that the choice of site for the Parliament, the setting of the timetable for construction, the fixing of the budget of &pound;50 million for construction, the selection of construction management for its procurement, the choice of architect and the appointment of the construction manager were decided by the Scottish Office before the Parliament was elected in May 1999 and that it is the consequences of those decisions that have caused the massive increase in costs and delay; further agrees with the finding that the Parliament was misled in June 1999 with regard to the costs of the project and that there is no greater democratic misdemeanour than misleading the Parliament and deplores the fact that there has been no ministerial accountability; regrets that the First Minister was not required to give oral evidence to Lord Fraser about his role as Minister for Finance in 1999; further regrets that the inquiry was set up without the necessary legal powers to require the appearance of witnesses and the production of documents and other material and agrees with the condemnation by Lord Fraser of the BBC&rsquo;s management for its refusal to co-operate with the Inquiry; calls upon the Scottish Executive to seek the powers that are presently reserved to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to make Executive civil servants fully accountable to Executive ministers and believes that, without such powers, essential reform of the Civil Service cannot take place; considers that the freedom of information legislation should be amended as soon as practicable to ensure that there is a presumption in favour of disclosure of information in relation to the use of public money in public sector contracts and that civil servants&rsquo; advice to ministers is not protected by the 30-year rule, and calls upon the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to take every possible step to ensure the recovery of any costs incurred as a result of negligence or breach of contract and to provide a proper means by which parliamentary scrutiny can be brought to bear upon its performance of its duties in taking these steps.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1727.1</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Holyrood Inquiry Report</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1727) in the name of Robert Brown, insert at end &quot;and, in so doing, welcomes its findings and recommendations but regrets that, in its conclusions, it fails to place due emphasis on the principle of ministerial responsibility and accountability.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1727.2</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: Holyrood Inquiry Report</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1727) in the name of Robert Brown, leave out from &quot;invites&quot; to end and insert &quot;calls on the political parties and groups represented on the Parliamentary Bureau to nominate one person from each of their respective political parties or groups, other than those members who served on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body or were members of the Scottish Executive at the time covered by the report, to form a special committee of the Parliament to consider the report and make recommendations as to the future conduct of the civil service, the Corporate Body, the Chief Executive of the Parliament and the Executive in discharging their public duties.&quot; </p>
