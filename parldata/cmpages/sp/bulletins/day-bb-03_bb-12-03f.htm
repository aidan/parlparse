          <p><strong>*S2M-697</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Financial 
            Powers of the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that, 
            in order to be properly accountable to the electorate, it should be 
            responsible for raising its revenue as well as spending public money 
            and agrees that making every country follow the same tax rules diminishes 
            competitiveness by killing jobs and stifling growth.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-696</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Sodexho 
            Contract; Solidarity with Public Sector Workers in British Columbia</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is concerned at the practices of Sodexho in tendering 
            for and running contracted-out public services in British Columbia 
            in the context of a neo-liberal provincial government that is abolishing 
            collective agreements, privatising public sector jobs and sacking 
            thousands of public sector workers, pushing through anti-trade union 
            legislation and employment laws that remove all forms of protection 
            including transfer (succession) rights and allowing multi-nationals 
            like Sodexho to employ whole new workforces on less than half their 
            previous pay, equivalent to that which ancillary health workers earned 
            30 years ago, with no benefits, exploit women and immigrant workers 
            particularly and ride roughshod over the rights of workers to organise 
            in trade unions; believes that these practices, and those already 
            evident in Scotland in contracts like those at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, 
            show that Sodexho is not the sort of company that the Scottish Parliament 
            should be associated with, and considers that the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body should review the current contract with Sodexho and 
            take steps to bring that contract in-house as soon as is practicably 
            possible, whilst guaranteeing and securing the employment at the Parliament 
            of all current Sodexho employees.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-695</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>Protecting 
            Bathing Water Quality</strong>-That the Parliament commends the results 
            achieved during the 2003 bathing season for Scotland's designated 
            bathing waters; welcomes the Scottish Executive's continued commitment 
            to place the environment at the forefront of our strategy for protecting 
            our bathing waters; acknowledges the importance of continuing to strive 
            to achieve best value from the considerable investment that Scotland 
            is applying, which in turn enhances Scotland's tourist credentials, 
            and endorses the partnership approach taken by the Executive to work 
            with all sectors to reduce pollution to the water environment.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-694</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>European 
            Parliament Seat Numbers</strong>-That the Parliament supports the 
            European and External Relations Committee's unanimous call for Scotland 
            to retain eight Members of the European Parliament.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-693</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            National Blood Transfusion Service</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service appeal for new blood 
            donors to tackle the current crisis in supplies that could lead to 
            hospitals being told that only emergency operations can be carried 
            out because blood stocks are so low; calls on the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body to make the necessary arrangements for a mobile donor 
            unit to come to the Parliament; encourages all MSPs and their staff 
            to lead by example in donating a pint of blood where physically possible, 
            and resolves to support high profile campaigns to encourage more Scots 
            to become blood donors and thus save and enhance the lives of others.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-691</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses on Strike at Christmas</strong>-That the Parliament salutes 
            the courage and determination of nursery nurses continuing to strike 
            after seven months on the picket line; affirms its support for the 
            nursery nurses' claim; regrets that nursery nurses and their families 
            are forced to face a Christmas on the picket lines by intransigent 
            employers and a Scottish Executive that is content to place increasing 
            demands on nursery nurses but not prepared to use its powers to ensure 
            a proper career and salary structure across Scotland that recognises 
            the extremely valuable contribution nursery nurses make to the development 
            of our children; recognises that the Executive's failure to engage 
            in the issues at the heart of this dispute gives credence to those 
            who argue that it demonstrates a lack of vision and hesitancy, and 
            calls on the Executive to restore confidence in the Parliament by 
            intervening to secure a settlement to this dispute agreeable to nursery 
            nurses and UNISON before Christmas.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-690</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Fife 
            Domestic Abuse Forum</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the 
            10th birthday of the Fife Domestic Abuse Forum, the longest running 
            partnership of its kind in Scotland; supports the launch of the next 
            phase of the highly successful &quot;Talk&quot; public awareness campaign 
            that will see poster images throughout Fife in the coming months on 
            the theme &quot;Domestic Abuse There is No Excuse&quot;; notes that 
            last year the number of requests for information, support or refuge 
            from Women's Aid and the Domestic Abuse Unit in Fife increased by 
            29% to 10,000 which represents an increase in awareness and people 
            accessing services; welcomes the new Women's Refuge in Kirkcaldy,

            on the ground-breaking road safety venture Safe Drive - Stay Alive; 
            recognises the pivotal role played by Fife firemaster Mike Bitcom 
            and his staff in organising the three-day event; acknowledges that 
            over 4,000 fifth year pupils attended from all over the Kingdom, and 
            believes that other local authorities should consider similar events 
            as a means of introducing novice drivers to the real-life consequences

            our justice system means more than ensuring that people get legal

            that works and in which the public has confidence, and therefore calls 
            for an end to delays in cases coming to court, an end to automatic

            many people in need of legal advice, information and representation

            quality legal advice and representation for people who cannot afford 
            to pay for it is less accessible now than previously, and that access 
            to advice and assistance from non-legally qualified providers, which 
            in many circumstances is more appropriate than access to a solicitor, 
            remains needlessly fragmented and geographically inconsistent due
