          <p><strong>*S2M-829</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Scotland-Wide 
            Cannabis Tolerance Zones</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that, 
            in order to strike a blow at the criminal black market, help free 
            up police time and help agencies deal more effectively with the problem 
            of hard drugs, the Scottish Executive should seek to reach an agreement 
            with the eight regional police forces in Scotland to create a Scotland-wide 
            cannabis tolerance zone where users would cease to be criminalised 
            for possessing amounts of cannabis for personal use and where a network 
            of licensed cannabis outlets can be established along the lines of 
            the Dutch model for the sale of small amounts of cannabis prior to 
            any change in the legal status of the Class C substance.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-828</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Modernising 
            the Court System - A New Supreme Court</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that it is a cardinal feature of a modern democratic state 
            that the judiciary should be separated from the legislature and therefore 
            supports the creation of a new Supreme Court believing that it will 
            strengthen the independence of the judiciary.</P>

            notes the crucial role of co-operative and mutual organisations within 
            local communities and across Scotland; recognises the wide variety 
            in size, capacity and in areas of activity of co-operative and mutual 
            initiatives; congratulates those involved within the co-operative 
            and mutual sector both on the key role they play in local and Scottish-wide 
            economic activity and in delivering social justice; welcomes the commitment 
            of the Scottish Executive to establish a Co-operative Development 
            Agency (CDA), and believes that departments across the range of Executive 
            responsibilities must work together to ensure that the CDA will effectively 
            support and strengthen co-operative and mutual enterprises in all 
            their diversity.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-823</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> 
            <strong>Holocaust Memorial Day, 27 January 2004</strong>-That the 
            Parliament recognises the importance of Holocaust Memorial Day; acknowledges 
            the significance of 27 January as the anniversary of the liberation 
            of Auschwitz in 1945 and remembers those before and since whose lives 
            were cut short because of acts of genocide; thanks the survivors for 
            their enduring courage and strength, for sharing their memories and 
            for their living testimony to the inhumanity of which we are capable; 
            warns of the dangers that still exist because of racial discrimination; 
            reaffirms the need to make succeeding generations aware of the horrors 
            that can stem from ignorance and prejudice, and pledges tolerance 
            and respect for others as a fitting memorial to those who died in 
            the cruelty and barbarity of the Holocaust.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-822#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>&quot;In 
            Touch&quot;, Out of Touch?</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            success of projects such as &quot;In Touch&quot; in Galashiels which, 
            through New Futures funding, enables young people between the ages 
            of 16 and 25 to move towards education, training and employment; further 
            notes that since January 2000, when the project started, some 200 
            young people have used its facilities, that currently there are 35 
            to 40 clients, that some referrals are from social work, some from 
            youth offending services and some are from Penumbra, among other agencies, 
            that of those who have taken part for whom outcomes are known only 
            five are known to have gone to, or returned to, prison and that 23 
            started in full-time employment, four started in part-time work and 
            31 went into some form of further education; is most concerned that 
            this project will run out of New Futures funding at the end of March 
            2004, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should as 
            a matter of urgency provide, either through direct funding or through 
            the Scottish Enterprise New Futures Fund, interim funding until either 
            the termination of the New Futures Fund nationally or &quot;In Touch&quot; 
            secures substitute funding, whichever is the earlier.</P>

            domestic abuse to cover all abuse among the members of a household.</P>
