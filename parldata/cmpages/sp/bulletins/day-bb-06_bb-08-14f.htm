<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4705</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Crisis in the Middle East</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled by the continuing Israeli offensive in Lebanon; notes that the last four weeks of the conflict have marked a new escalation in violence, with 998 Lebanese and 102 Israeli people having been killed, and that diplomatic efforts have not yet secured an agreement on a UN resolution; believes that the UK Government&rsquo;s current policy on the Middle East is fundamentally flawed, while the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to rage on; believes that the UK Parliament should be recalled to debate the situation and its effect on UK security, to instruct the UK Government to call for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and to exert every possible pressure on Israel to end immediately its invasions of Gaza and Lebanon and its threats against Syria, and sends its support and solidarity to all campaigners attending the demonstration to be held on Saturday 12 August 2006, in Edinburgh, to further the cause of a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4704</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Police Community Clubs of Great Britain</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the excellent work carried out by Police Community Clubs of Great Britain (PCCGB), an organisation whose membership comprises of retired and serving police officers committed to helping young people and whose education and citizenship initiatives, and promotion of sports and leisure activities, demonstrate how essential values can be learned and put into practice; congratulates PCCGB on the launch of its campaign to combat bullying and vandalism; welcomes the involvement of both the community police and the local authority in the recent successful pilot in Renfrewshire which used the booklet <em>Barney and Echo &ndash; A Friendship Made!</em>, together with games to promote good citizenship, to help children aged between 7 and 11 discuss their own experiences and to highlight the dangers of bullying and emphasise the anti-bullying message; notes that bullying has resulted in the suicide of approximately 20 young people each year; recognises that many young people have cause to be grateful for the organisation&rsquo;s work, and encourages individuals, local authorities and business in Scotland to support the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4703</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Positive Engagement towards Cuba</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament extends its regards to Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the Republic of Cuba, on the occasion of his 80th birthday on 13 August 2006; notes his current ill-health and wishes him a speedy recovery; is concerned by reports which show that UK exports to Cuba have decreased by 48% since 2000 whilst trade has been increasing between Cuba and other EU countries during this period; deplores the illegal US blockade of Cuba, including the recent tightening of extra-territorial elements which directly affect relations between the European Union and Cuba; calls on the Scottish Executive to explore options for strengthening relations between Scotland and Cuba through cultural, scientific, sporting and trade links, and considers that the Executive should urge Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to maintain and develop its independent approach of positive engagement towards Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4702</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Selkirk&rsquo;s Silver Arrow Returns</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the return of Selkirk&rsquo;s Silver Arrow to its name place on 29 August 2006, where it will be handed over to the current sheriff, Sheriff Drummond; notes that this is highly appropriate given that this 350-year-old arrow was delivered in 1818 by the then sheriff of Selkirk, Sir Walter Scott, into the hands of the Royal Company of Archers, and congratulates all who have contributed to its return.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4701&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Contribution of Pharma-Related Business Activity to the Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent report for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Scotland from economics consultancy, EPA, which shows that pharma-related businesses, such as Shasun Pharma Solutions in Annan, contribute some &pound;830 million each year to the turnover of Scotland&rsquo;s economy, are responsible for nearly &pound;470 million in spending on goods and services, support 12,500 jobs and directly employ 8,000 people in Scotland; recognises that the sector is key to the nation&rsquo;s economic well-being; commends the efforts of those who seek to win new investment by the sector in Scotland; recognises the need to attract the best and brightest people from around the world into this area of activity, and considers that the Scottish Executive should provide appropriate support for pharma-related businesses, their people and their products.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4700</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Crystal and Selkirk Glass</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that Edinburgh Crystal, with its headquarters in Penicuik, has been put into administration with the loss of 70 local jobs and that this represents a substantial blow to the local economy and to the individuals who have lost their employment and to their families; notes that Edinburgh Crystal is an internationally recognised Scottish company and calls on the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning to intervene to ensure that the company remains productive in Scotland, and, noting that Caithness Glass is also in administration, calls on the minister to support that company and its other sister company, Selkirk Glass, which is a success story in the Borders, diversifying as it has through its visitor centre and highly successful caf&eacute;/restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4699</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Scottish Seabird Centre, North Berwick</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the success of the Scottish Seabird Centre, an independent charity whose purpose is to increase awareness, appreciation and care of Scotland&rsquo;s rich natural heritage and that it is a world leader in wildlife viewing, with over 200,000 visitors every year supported by over 50 active volunteers; further recognises that, being located at the centre of North Berwick, it has revitalised the community and, in particular, the historic harbour, contributing some &pound;1.5 million per annum to the local economy, and congratulates it on being shortlisted in the Scottish finals of the National Lottery Awards 2006.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4698</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Failure to Address Gender Pay Gap</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern that Scotland&rsquo;s modern apprentice scheme is worsening the gender pay gap, with females on skills seekers/modern apprenticeship training earning 31% less than males on the same schemes compared to a gap of 12% for the general workforce, and calls on the Scottish government to address this issue urgently.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4697</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Energy Saving Trust - Revocation of VAT Rebate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent decision by HM Revenue and Customs to revoke retrospectively the VAT rebate which has historically been enjoyed by the Energy Saving Trust, a government-funded non-profit organisation which promotes energy efficiency and carbon saving, with the effect that the trust must now repay approximately &pound;5 million or around 65% of its annual budget; further notes that this decision will lead to the cancellation of energy saving programmes and the loss of jobs at the trust throughout the United Kingdom as well as in Scotland; believes that this deeply regrettable decision will undermine the excellent work undertaken by the Scottish Executive to promote energy saving and energy efficiency, and urges the Executive to give careful consideration to increasing its grant to the Energy Saving Trust to make up some or all of the shortfall for the current year.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4696</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> <strong>University of Paisley</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the University of Paisley is holding a consultation exercise on the future name of the institution; further notes that Paisley is Scotland&rsquo;s largest town and has given the university its original existence and identity; acknowledges that other established universities have been able to expand and open up new campuses in other parts of the country without sacrificing their names; also acknowledges that the University of Paisley is already very successful in attracting students not only from other parts of the United Kingdom but also from overseas, particularly the Far East, and believes that the university can build on its reputation and strengths gained over the years as the University of Paisley and that a change of name would be a mistake for the university and Paisley.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4695</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen&rsquo;s Tartan Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of, and participants in, Aberdeen&rsquo;s Tartan Day celebration held on 5 August 2006; notes the wide variety of well-run fun, educational and cultural activities and events that promoted the city&rsquo;s important role in Scottish history, and calls on the Scottish Executive to place more emphasis on home-grown events that will encourage people of Scottish descent and those with an interest in Scottish culture to celebrate Tartan Day in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4694</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Humanitarian Aid to the Middle East</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates development agencies working in the Middle East for the work that they are doing to deliver humanitarian aid to all those affected by the current crisis; calls on the international community to take steps to improve access to humanitarian aid and to get assistance to internally displaced people and refugees who are victims of the current crisis; believes that to achieve this and prevent any further civilian casualties an immediate cessation in hostilities is needed, and supports UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan&rsquo;s call for a durable ceasefire.</p>
