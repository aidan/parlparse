            last few years; notes that Whitfield, like many other parts of Scotland, 
            has its fair share of problems but recognises the great progress made 
            by community-based organisations; however, further notes the Save 
            the Children report, <em>The Well-being of Children in the UK</em>, 
            that highlights the persistence of poverty and other problems in parts 
            of the estate; regrets that the Whitfield Partnership was wound up 
            by the Scotland Office without a proper exit strategy, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government should redouble 
            their efforts to eradicate child poverty from Whitfield and every

            to his contribution to the National Health Service as a physician, 
            scientist, professor of medicine, President of the Royal College of 
            Physicians and President of the British Medical Association and also 
            as a steadfast campaigner for recognition of the links between poverty 
            and ill-health, most notably in his scholarship and research in the 
            pioneering work comprised in the report, <em>Inequalities in Health</em>, 
            which provided evidence that at every important stage of life people 
            of the lowest incomes suffered disproportionately from ill-health 
            and premature death; extends its thanks for his work to build a better 
            future, and extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to Sir Douglas'

            the decision to commission major research into the extent of sectarianism 
            and Glaswegians' perception of it and acknowledges that this research 
            will allow the development of meaningful action to tackle sectarianism; 
            further welcomes the initiative by the council in bringing together 
            all the major faiths in the city to launch the &quot;Forum of Faiths&quot; 
            on 23 September 2002, an initiative which will work to foster respect 
            and understanding amongst people of all religious beliefs and none 
            in Scotland's largest city; congratulates all those involved in this 
            important work, and welcomes this measured approach which looks beyond 
            simplistic rhetoric and provides a model for those who seek to eradicate 
            sectarianism across Scotland.</p>
