            <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: International Nurses' Day 2001</strong>—That the 
            Parliament pledges its support for International Nurses’ Day, which 
            is celebrated around the world every 12 May on the anniversary of 
            Florence Nightingale’s birth; notes that the theme for 2001, Nurses, 
            Always There for You: United Against Violence, highlights the fact 
            that violence is overtaking infectious diseases as a major public 
            health problem, with more than 2 million people dying as a result 
            of injuries sustained due to violence; recognises that nurses are 
            themselves threatened with violence in the workplace and are three 
            times more likely to experience violence than other professionals, 
            and congratulates the International Council of Nurses on its new partnership 
            with the World Health Organisation, the International Labour Organisation 
            and Public Services International which is rolling out a broad-based 
            anti-violence campaign, the priority of which is the elimination of 
            violence from the health sector workplace.</font></p>

            <strong>Des McNulty: Chester Street Insurance Holdings Ltd</strong>—That the 
            Parliament welcomes the successful outcome of the campaign at Westminster 
            led by Clydebank MP Tony Worthington on behalf of asbestos disease 
            sufferers affected by the collapse of Chester Street Insurance Holdings 
            Ltd; congratulates Chancellor Gordon Brown and Scottish Secretary 
            Helen Liddell on their role in hammering out a deal between Her Majesty’s 
            Treasury and the insurance companies to ensure that compensation is 
            paid; notes that asbestos-related disease has led to more than 1,800 
            deaths in Scotland since 1997, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            can assist in preventing further distress to sufferers and their families 
            by ensuring that legal actions relating to compensation claims are 
            not subject to delays in the Scottish courts.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1926#</strong> 
            <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil: Local Newspaper Week, 14 to 20 May 2001</strong>—That 
            the Parliament welcomes Local Newspaper Week; recognises that local 
            newspapers play a crucial role in their communities and can act as 
            a focal point of community life; acknowledges that they provide valuable 
            services such as scrutiny of local elected representatives and the 
            championing of local causes; further acknowledges that they are a 
            window on our communities and give us a unique opportunity to present 
            all that is positive within our areas to a wider audience, and notes 
            that the Greenock Telegraph is a fine example of these roles.</font></p>

            <strong>Ms Sandra White: European Year of Languages and BSL</strong>—That the 
            Parliament believes that in 2001, the European Year of Languages, 
            the Scottish Executive should take forward the lessons of the Millennium 
            Project 2000 which taught the basics of British Sign Language (BSL) 
            and Deaf Awareness to schoolchildren; invites the Scottish Executive 
            to investigate the introduction of BSL to the school curriculum, and 
            further believes that Her Majesty’s Government should give official 
            recognition to BSL under the terms of the European Charter on Minority 
            Languages.</font></p>
