              College, has made and continues to make to the rural economy of 
              Scotland; deplores the plans by the Scottish Agricultural College 
              to downgrade Auchincruive to a mere delivery vehicle for education 
              courses in association with Paisley University; views with concern 
              the prospective closure of Auchincruive as a research and teaching 
              facility if and when it amalgamates with the University&#146;s Ayr 
              campus, and considers that such a closure would be detrimental to 
              the economic development of Ayrshire and the south of Scotland.
