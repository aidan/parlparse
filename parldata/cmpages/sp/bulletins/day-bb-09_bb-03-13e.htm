<p><strong>Questions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>S3W-21774</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what timescale it envisages for the drafting and implementation of recommendations on permitted development rights for micro wind turbines and air source heat pumps.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21775</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is still committed to removing the need for planning permission for micro wind turbines.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21776</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what timescale it envisages for carrying out research on permitted development rights for micro wind turbines and air source heat pumps.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21777</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish the brief for the research to be carried out into permitted development rights for micro wind turbines and air source heat pumps.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21778</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the research into micro wind turbines and air source heat pumps will be carried out at the same time given the different issues raised by the decision to delay the granting of permitted development rights for micro wind turbines and air source heat pumps.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21779</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it intends to put in place to ensure that local authorities fully implement Scottish Planning Policy SPP 6: Renewable Energy.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21780</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it is taking to address the level of skill in carbon assessment linked to the implementation of planning regulations.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21781</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is committed to introducing permitted development rights for the installation of renewable technology for non-domestic buildings.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21782</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive for what reasons it remains opposed to allowing local authorities to offer local fiscal incentives to encourage the uptake of micro-generation and energy efficiency technologies.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21783</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what draft secondary legislation it expects to make available to the Transport Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee to aid its Stage 2 consideration of the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21784</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to develop a strategy to improve the energy efficiency of existing building stock.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21785</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it plans to implement to improve energy efficiency before the passage of the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21786</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive for what reason it has not included sites of special scientific interest and Ramsar sites within the scope of its draft regulations on the transposition of the EU environmental liability directive into Scots law.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21787</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to include sites of special scientific interest and Ramsar sites in the latest draft of regulations to transpose the EU environmental liability directive into Scots law in light of concern shown in responses to the Scottish Government<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s second consultation on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21788</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to change the regulations to transpose the EU environmental liability directive into Scots law from establishing environmental damage from conservation status to a measure of site integrity, in light of suggestions by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee and Scottish Environment LINK.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21789</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that sites of special scientific interest and Ramsar sites will be given second class status among sites of biodiversity and ecological importance if they are not protected under the EU environmental liability directive.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21790</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that omitting sites of special scientific interest and Ramsar sites from protection under the EU environmental liability directive will cause confusion between operators and authorities, and among authorities themselves, where responsibility overlaps or covers certain aspects of a site but not all of it and, if so, whether it considers that including such sites would alleviate these potential problems.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-21791</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware of the problems facing students studying dietetics due to the lack of placement opportunities and, if so, what action it is taking in response.</p>
