<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1981</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Arrest of Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s in Iran</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the news of the arrest of six prominent Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s in Iran on 14 May 2008; notes that Mrs Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr Jamaloddin Khanjai, Mr Afif Naeimi, Mr Saeid Rezaie, Mr Behrouz Tavakkoli, and Mr Vahid Tizfah are members of the informal group known as the Friends in Iran that co-ordinates the activities of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community in Iran; further notes that another member of the Friends in Iran, Mrs Mahvash Sabet, has been held in custody since 5 March 2008; registers deepest concern at the mounting threats and persecution of the Iranian Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community; believes that all countries should practice religious tolerance and freedom; further believes that the international community should seek from the Iranian Government guarantees for the safety of these individuals, and calls for their immediate unconditional release.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1980</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Fife Constabulary Annual Report 2007-08</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 2007-8 Annual Report from Fife Constabulary which will be the last report from Chief Constable, Peter Wilson; recognises the achievement of Mr Wilson and his force in further reducing crimes (reported incidents) for the fourth successive year; recognises reductions in road traffic incidents in Fife from 1,000 to 800, and further notes the successful Juvenile Warning Scheme which is reducing the number of persistent youth offenders from 109 in 2006-07 to 60 in 2007-08 and the Policing Our Festive Fife campaign which saw incidents of violent crime fall by 27% during the festive period.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1979</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Zoo Bid for Giant Pandas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the work of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland in securing a pair of breeding giant pandas, which will be located at Edinburgh Zoo; notes that the zoo already has an impressive track record on worldwide conservation and habitat management; appreciates that these pandas will be an important part of the extended captive breeding, research and educational programme operated in China; acknowledges the contribution that captive breeding makes to our understanding of the species, to its gene pool and to a diverse and sustainable panda population, and calls on the zoo to work together with the City of Edinburgh Council and other key partners to discuss and address any local or city-wide impacts and any animal welfare issues involved in bringing pandas to the zoo.</p>
