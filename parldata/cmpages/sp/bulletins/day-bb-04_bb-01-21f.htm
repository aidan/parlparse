            and Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill against the closure

            Index</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continued loss of population 
            from rural and island areas and its harmful effects on many communities; 
            *believes that* the Scottish Executive *should* create a &quot;Counterdrift 
            Index&quot; that sets out the details of its achievements in tackling 
            this issue, and considers that the index, published quarterly, should 
            flag up all relevant indicators including the number of affordable 
            houses built and public jobs dispersed to areas of depopulation, the 
            amount of land transferred for community use from both public and 
            private sectors, the number of modern apprenticeships turned into 
            permanent sustainable jobs and incentives delivered for tradespeople 
            to work in the affected areas.</P>
