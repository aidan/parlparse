      <strong>S1M-550 Mr Alasdair Morrison: Tourism&#151;</strong>That the Parliament
      welcomes the publication by the Scottish Executive of the New Strategy for Scottish
      Tourism and commends this as the way to achieve a modern tourist industry in touch with
      its customers, a skilled and enterprising industry that has embraced the culture of
      lifelong learning, and an industry that provides the high quality of service our visitors
      demand. </p><blockquote><p ALIGN="left">

          New Strategy for Scottish Tourism, but believes that this vision will not be achieved
          unless effective action is taken by the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty&#146;s
          Government to tackle the problem facing the industry in Scotland of relative competitive
          disadvantage; calls upon the Scottish Executive to give further careful consideration to
          the responses to the consultation paper and to provide, as a focus for a wide ranging
          public debate, an analysis of the responses, thereby demonstrating that it takes seriously
          the submissions made by the industry, and further believes that Scotland should be ready
          and willing to learn from its competitors, such as Ireland, in order to promote best
          practice in the home tourist industry.&quot; </p><p ALIGN="left">

          Executive of the New Strategy for Scottish Tourism and regrets that it fails to address
