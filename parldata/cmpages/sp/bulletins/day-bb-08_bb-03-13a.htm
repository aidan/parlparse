  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-1548.2</strong> <strong>David Stewart: National Parks</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1548) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end &quot;and believes that the following issues should be included for specific consideration in the review: the effectiveness of the national parks in achieving the main objectives set out in the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, the success of the national parks in building community engagement and involvement in the development of both parks, and whether the boundaries of the parks should be reviewed.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-1548.1</strong> <strong>John Scott: National Parks</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1548) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish Government to address concerns regarding the structural effectiveness of the national park authorities as presently constituted with a view to enhancing local participation and to address ongoing issues with regard to the southern boundary of the Cairngorms National Park.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-1548.3</strong> <strong>Jim Hume: National Parks</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1548) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end &quot;welcomes the quinquennial review as an opportunity to examine the operation of the park authorities and any proposed boundary changes; believes that the park authorities&rsquo; national body status and strong directly elected presence provides the parks with the freedom and flexibility to carry out their unique statutory objectives and to meet the needs of very different park areas across Scotland; considers that any attempt to roll up the park authorities with Scottish Natural Heritage would hamper the parks&rsquo; capability to achieve these objectives, would damage local accountability and democracy and could have serious conflict of interest ramifications, and therefore calls for the forthcoming strategic review of the national parks to retain the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority and the Cairngorms National Park Authority as national bodies with at least five directly elected board members.&quot; </p>
