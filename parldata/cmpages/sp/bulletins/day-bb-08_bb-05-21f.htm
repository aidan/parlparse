<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1955</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Scottish Ambulance Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the concerns expressed by the Scottish public about recent changes to the operation of the Scottish Ambulance Service; believes that, as the ambulance service is a widely respected and essential public service in Scotland, any changes should have been communicated to the Scottish public, and, in light of concerns expressed about the safety of patients, agrees that there should be immediate independent scrutiny of current practices and policies in the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1954</strong> <strong>Frank Mulholland:</strong> <strong>Wildlife Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report, <em>Natural Justice: A Joint Thematic Inspection of the Arrangements in Scotland for Preventing, Investigating and Prosecuting Wildlife Crime,</em> by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland and the Inspectorate of Prosecution in Scotland; commends the recommendations in the report, the implementation of which will bring to bear the full professional expertise of the agencies who investigate, detect and prosecute those involved in wildlife crime, and looks forward to the development of a strong and effective partnership for action against wildlife crime, working to a new agreed strategy on wildlife crime and co-ordinating the fight against the abuse of Scotland&rsquo;s vital natural heritage.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1953</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of the UK Government to proceed with the construction of two new aircraft carriers, to be named HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, and notes that the new carriers, which are to be built by a consortium of BAE Systems and the VT Group, will sustain the long-term future of shipbuilding on the Clyde, creating or sustaining 3,500 jobs at Scotstoun and Govan Shipyards along with a major expansion of the Rosyth Naval Dockyard on the Forth, and involving a total of more than 10,000 jobs across the UK including work at Portsmouth and Barrow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1952&diams; </strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Home Fuel Oil Prices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the very substantial rises in the price of home fuel oil which many people, particularly in rural areas such as the South of Scotland, rely on for heating; believes that urgent action is needed to tackle fuel poverty among those relying on such oil as well as those who use gas and electricity; believes that the soaring price of fuel oil should be investigated, and further believes that this industry should be subject to the same regulation as gas and electricity suppliers.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Bashir Ahmad<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1951</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Skills Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s skills strategy was rejected by the Parliament on 12 September 2007; recognises the importance of skills development and utilisation in growing Scotland&rsquo;s economy; voices concern at the decision of the Scottish Government to move away from supporting adult apprenticeships in vital areas such as the tourism, IT and retail sectors without consultation with work-based training providers; calls on the Scottish Government to provide the Parliament, with immediate effect, the evidence to support these moves, and further calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a revised skills strategy immediately after the summer recess containing detailed information about the level at which its 50,000 training places are being set, its targets for apprenticeships and the performance indicators used to measure success.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1950#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Action to Protect the Red Squirrel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the continuing encroachment of the non-native grey squirrel in Scotland on native red squirrel territory, including parts of Mid-Scotland and Fife; notes that Scotland is the last stronghold in the United Kingdom for red squirrels and is home to approximately 120,000 reds, which accounts for 75% of the UK red squirrel population; observes that red and grey squirrels are unable to co-exist together in the same territory and that red squirrels eventually disappear due to competition for food and the carrying of the squirrel pox virus by grey squirrels which is harmless to them but fatal to reds; is alarmed to learn that the first grey squirrel was officially reported in the Highlands near Inverness in April 2008 and that the first red squirrel in Scotland contracted squirrel pox in the South of Scotland in May 2007, underlining the growing threat to red squirrels in Scotland, and believes that urgent action is required to protect the red squirrel, including research into immunocontraception for grey squirrels.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1949</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Walk to School Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds pupils and parents in East Renfrewshire and across Scotland in supporting Walk to School Week from 19 to 23 May 2008; congratulates the walk to school campaign in this its 13th year but notes that over 50% of children still don&rsquo;t walk to school regularly; notes that cars consume most fuel and pollute more at the start of their journeys and that therefore walking for short journeys will reduce the amount of CO2 emissions by a disproportionate amount; further notes that nearly 30% of children aged two to 15 are classed as overweight or obese, and commends the efforts that have been made by schools and local authorities across the UK in not only supporting the walk to school campaign but in working to establish safe routes to school for all pupils all year round.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1948</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>First Glasgow Fare Increases</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the recent bus fare increases of up to 25% by First Glasgow are unacceptable; notes that this includes raising the price of a child all-day ticket to &pound;2, that this will be too much for some families and that with the summer holidays just around the corner this comes at the worst possible time for them; further notes that the fare cap has been lifted by the Competition Commission partly due to rising fuel costs despite UK First Bus seeing an increase in its operating profits of 11% to &pound;122 million, a bigger jump than last year and far higher than FirstGroup as a whole which had a 7.6% increase in operating profits; believes that, with FirstGroup declaring preliminary profits of almost &pound;152 million, there is no need to put fares up in this way and that if it has a problem with the level of rising fuel prices it should make representations to the UK Exchequer and not pick on hard-pressed commuters, and calls on UK First Bus to rethink its pricing strategy or at the very least guarantee a future price freeze over a number of years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1947</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Land Rights of Indigenous Peoples</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples adopted in September 2007 and acknowledges that indigenous people have suffered many historic injustices and continue to be among the poorest and most marginalised peoples of the world; believes that these injustices will be brought to an end and their poverty alleviated only if the land rights of indigenous people are recognised and respected, and further believes that a major step forward in achieving this is the International Labour Organisation&rsquo;s Convention 169 concerning tribal and indigenous peoples, which puts these rights on a firm legal footing.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1946</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Innes Smith</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the achievement of Innes Smith, aged 21, who landed on Rockall on Wednesday 14 May 2008 with Charles Veley, the world&rsquo;s most travelled man; congratulates Innes for swimming out to Rockall before climbing to the top of the rock with a Saltire and a flag made of Harris Tweed; notes that Innes is most probably the youngest person to land on Rockall and is the only person to circumnavigate the rock by kayak; acknowledges this very rare feat, and congratulates Innes for his achievements.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1945</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Adult Learners&rsquo; Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of lifelong learning; believes that lifelong learning should be a right not a privilege; welcomes the 17th Adult Learners&rsquo; Week running from 17 to 23 May 2008; further notes that, as part of the UK&rsquo;s largest celebration of adult learning, learning providers are highlighting the opportunities available to adult learners through a range of activities, including introductory chats with learning advisers and taster sessions; recognises the achievements of Scotland&rsquo;s Learning Partnership that are ensuring that over 7,500 organisations and 95,000 adults and children participate in the week-long events, and looks forward to congratulating the winners of the 2008 Adult Learners&rsquo; Week Awards.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1944</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Volunteers&rsquo; Week 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Volunteers&rsquo; Week in Scotland is taking place from 1 to 7 June 2008; thanks volunteers across Scotland for their hard work and contribution to local communities like Cumbernauld and Kilsyth; welcomes new volunteers who will be joining committed people helping others in all walks of life, and praises the important contribution that volunteers make to Scottish life and communities every day of the year.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1943.1</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Hepatitis C</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1943) in the name of Shona Robison, leave out &quot;acknowledges&quot; and insert &quot;commends the hard work undertaken by those staff involved in delivering 40 out of 41 action points in Phase I of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Hepatitis C Action Plan and welcomes&quot;.</p>
