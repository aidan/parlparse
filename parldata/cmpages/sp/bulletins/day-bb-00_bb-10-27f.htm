          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1288</strong></font><font face="Arial"> <strong>Mr 
            Brian Monteith: Recognition of the Success of the British Paralympic 
            Team</strong>—That the Parliament extends its warmest congratulations to 
            Caroline Innes from Fife on her achievement of winning two athletics 
            gold medals in the 200 and 400 metre events, and for establishing 
            a new 200 metre world record, and to all 214 members of the British 
            Paralympic team competing in the Sydney Games, who have so far won 
            more than 70 medals and produced a number of personal best performances.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1287#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Funding 
            for Disabled People and their Carers</strong>—That the Parliament recognises 
            that the current levels of social security benefits for disabled people 
            and their carers do not meet the costs of either disability or care; 
            further recognises that means testing for community care services 
            penalises both disabled people and their carers, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should investigate and report separately on 
            (a) income levels of disabled people and their carers, (b) take-up 
            of services by disabled people and their carers and (c) social inclusion 
            and equality of opportunity for these groups. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Supported by: Mr Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1286</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Glasgow Light 
            Rail Scheme</strong>—That the Parliament believes that the construction 
            of a light rail scheme in Glasgow would provide enormous benefits 
            to the city in relation to jobs, improving the environment, tackling 
            congestion and related pollution and regenerating the city as a tourist 
            attraction; resolves therefore to reappraise urgently the Strathclyde 
            Passenger Transport Executive’s private legislation proposal for a 
            light rail scheme promoted in 1994 but rejected by four Parliamentary 
            Commissioners, appointed under the Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) 
            Act 1936, in 1996, and agrees that this matter deserves to be investigated 
            by the Minister for Transport and the Environment immediately.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1285#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Establishment 
            of a Children's Fund</strong>—That the Parliament applauds the decision 
            of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to establish a Children’s Fund 
            south of the border as a way of providing funding to local organisations 
            and communities to tackle child poverty; believes that such a fund 
            will go a long way to help young people develop their own projects 
            and solutions to everyday problems, fund existing initiatives, support 
            voluntary and local community projects and help promote children’s 
            involvement in services; is concerned that the Scottish Executive 
            appears hesitant about establishing a Children’s Fund in Scotland, 
            and calls for consultation with community children’s organisations 
            and young people on the establishment of an innovative and creative 
            Children’s Fund, without the complex system of partnerships and funding 
            mazes that bedevil so many other of their strategies.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1284#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Voluntary 
            Sector Access to Criminal Record Information</strong>—That the Parliament 
            welcomes plans to introduce detailed criminal record checks on people 
            working with children under 18 from July 2001; notes, however, that 
            many voluntary organisations are deeply concerned at having to pay 
            to obtain enhanced criminal record certificates; believes such costs 
            place an extra burden on groups working with children; accepts the 
            consensus position within the voluntary sector that it should not 
            have to pay for access to vital child protection information; understands 
            that financial barriers placed in the way of organisations working 
            with children mean fewer safe environments for children and create 
            a barrier to social inclusion, and asks the Scottish Executive to 
            ensure that the voluntary sector free access across the board to criminal 
            record information. </font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1283</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: High Fuel 
            Prices</strong>—That the Parliament expresses its continued concern at 
            the escalating price of fuel and calls upon the Chancellor of the 
            Exchequer to take measures to lessen the impact of such high fuel 
            costs on the economic well-being of Scotland and its people and to 
            encourage other EU member states to discourage the illegal transportation 
            of fuel across national boundaries.</font></p>
