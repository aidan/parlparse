          <p><strong>S1M-4054</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Attack on Iraq</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament condemns the decision by Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to order Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces to join the United States 
            of America in the use of military force against Iraq; recognises that 
            this military action will result in the deaths and injury of both 
            innocent Iraqi civilians and United Kingdom servicemen and servicewomen; 
            recognises that such military action is contrary to international 
            law and has undermined the authority of the United Nations; believes 
            that such unilateral action is weakening the international coalition 
            against terrorism and will result in increased support for terrorist 
            groups whose intention is to act against civilians in the United Kingdom 
            and in other countries, and calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to disengage Her Majesty&#146;s forces from hostilities against Iraq, 
            to ensure in the meantime everything is done to minimise the number 
            of civilian casualties resulting from this military action, particularly 
            those caused by the use of cluster bombs, depleted-uranium armaments 
            and landmines and to ensure that humanitarian relief is provided immediately 
            upon the cessation of hostilities.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4053</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Closure of Rankin 
            Maternity Unit at Inverclyde Royal Hospital</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament notes the comments of Inverclyde GP Dr Mustafa Kapasi in 
            the <em>Big Issues in Scotland </em>for 13 to 19 March 2003, in relation 
            to the threatened closure of the 29-bed Rankin Maternity Unit at Greenock's 
            Inverclyde Royal Hospital, that the closure plan was a "farce" and 
            that "the maternity unit should remain in Inverclyde &#133; It has 
            the best safety record in Scotland. Paisley is a run-down hospital 
            and for patients to be travelling 20-40 miles to reach it is a disaster"; 
            further notes that GPs from both Inverclyde and Paisley unanimously 
            voted in favour of the unit remaining in Greenock, and therefore resolves 
            to support the local community and medical campaign to save the Rankin 
            Maternity Unit from closure.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4052</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Imposition of Pay 
            Deal on Fire Service Personnel</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns 
            the Deputy Prime Minister&#146;s intention to impose a pay deal on 
            fire service personnel in England and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to refuse to follow this route and instead properly fund the fire 
            service&#146;s pay claim and allow a free and negotiated settlement.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4051</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Hampden National 
            Stadium Sports Health and Injury Clinic</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            congratulates all associated with the multi-sport Hampden National 
            Stadium sports health and injury clinic charitable trust, whose members 
            are the Scottish Football Association, University of Glasgow, Strathclyde 
            University and Glasgow Caledonian University, which was formally opened 
            by Sir Alex Ferguson on Thursday 20 March 2003; notes that the official 
            opening took place almost a year from when the clinic first began 
            offering the very best in sports medicine treatment and facilities 
            to the public seven days a week; believes that the clinic serves as 
            a national resource and focus for research and educational activity 
            within sport and exercise medicine fitness and provides specialised 
            equipment and access for disability athletes and that the vast majority 
            of clients to the clinic have been sportsmen and women who exercise 
            for fun and for health; recognises the contribution of the clinic 
            as an important addition to the sporting facilities of the whole region 
            and in developing expertise in sports medicine, and encourages private 
            and public support for the clinic. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4050</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: The Current International 
            Situation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament deeply regrets the commencement 
            of military action in Iraq; believes that the failure to settle this 
            crisis by peaceful means will have long-term repercussions for world 
            security and peace; recognises the overwhelming strength of feeling 
            in Scotland that opposes such action; further recognises that Scottish 
            servicemen and women are now involved in this action and extends its 
            support to them and their families at this time; demands that every 
            effort must be made to protect the civilian population of Iraq from 
            direct military threat, from starvation and from the consequences 
            of disease and hardship caused by the destruction of civil infrastructure 
            such as water treatment and power plants, and calls for this conflict 
            to be brought to a speedy conclusion.</p>

            Mr Kenny MacAskill, Linda Fabiani, Brian Adam, Michael Russell, Shona 
            Robison, Mr Kenneth Gibson, Richard Lochhead, Alasdair Morgan</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4049</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Stop the War</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament condemns the commencement of war against Iraq and calls 
            for an immediate cessation of hostilities with a view to recommencing 
            efforts to find a peaceful solution.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John McAllion, Elaine Smith, Margo MacDonald, Tommy 
            Sheridan, Robin Harper, Mr Lloyd Quinan, Dorothy-Grace Elder</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4048</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson: Cairngorms National 
            Park - Ministerial Appointments</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            believes that ministerial appointments to the Cairngorms National 
            Park should include a fair proportion from the business community 
            operating within the national park boundary.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Fergusson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4046</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Scottish Agricultural 
            College Restructuring</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            decision of the board of the Scottish Agricultural College to restructure 
            the colleges at Edinburgh as recommended in the Deloitte &amp; Touche 
            survey; regrets that this decision ignores the social impact of the 
            recommendations on the south west and north east of Scotland and runs 
            contrary to the Scottish Executive&#146;s policy of dispersing agency 
            and department jobs and offices outwith the central belt; considers 
            that the basis for some of the evidence, such as the student survey, 
            is questionable as is the weighting system which was devised by the 
            board itself, and calls for a further study into the potential of 
            the Auchincruive campus as the sole location of the colleges&#146; 
            educational and advisory services in its future structure.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David Mundell, John Scott, Phil Gallie, Stewart Stevenson,

          <p><strong>S1M-4046.1</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Scottish Agricultural 
            College Restructuring</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-4046) 
            in the name of Alex Fergusson, leave out from &quot;potential&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;Scottish Agricultural College&#146;s educational 
            and advisory services.&quot; </p>
          <p>Supported by: Richard Lochhead, Mr Jamie Stone, Alex Johnstone</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4045</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: United Kingdom Social 
            Enterprise of the Year</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            McSence of Midlothian, the biggest social enterprise in Scotland, 
            has won the title of United Kingdom Social Enterprise of the Year; 
            congratulates McSence on winning this prestigious <em>New Statesman</em> 
            award; further notes that the community business was started up following 
            the closure of the Bilston Glen and Monktonhall coal mines, and welcomes 
            the fact that it now turns over £1.5 million per annum, with £250,000 
            of the profits being ploughed back into projects for the unemployed, 
            children, elderly people and the local community.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dr Sylvia Jackson, Karen Gillon, Robin Harper, Bill

          <p><strong>S1M-4044</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Scottish Agricultural 
            College</strong>&#151;That the Parliament views with concern the plans 
            by the Scottish Agricultural College Board to move the college&#146;s 
            teaching and research services from Auchincruive, Ayrshire, and Craibstone, 
            Aberdeenshire, to Edinburgh and calls for a full economic impact assessment 
            that takes into account the effect that this move will have on students, 
            staff and local communities before the proposal is approved by the 
            Scottish Executive.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Johnstone, Christine Grahame, Alex Neil, Richard

          <p><strong>S1M-4041</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Comments by SNP 
            Councillor on Firefighters</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns 
            the comments of SNP councillor and Convener of the Tayside Joint Fire 
            Board, Frances Duncan, who labelled firefighters who take part in 
            democratic strike action on 20 March 2003 as "irresponsible"; condemns 
            her specific comments in the <em>Dundee Evening Telegraph</em> of 
            18 March 2003 that "I feel it would be rather irresponsible for FBU 
            General Secretary Andy Gilchrist to encourage his members to strike 
            during a time of imminent war"; believes these comments to be wholly 
            inappropriate, especially in the light of the disgusting attacks on 
            firefighters made by Tory MP Bernard Jenkin to the effect that firefighters 
            were the "friends of Saddam", and upholds the democratic right of 
            trade unionists to engage in legitimate industrial action, including 
            the withdrawal of their labour, regardless of any central government 
            action in an illegal war with Iraq.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dorothy-Grace Elder</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4040</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Illegal Bombardment 
            of Iraq</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes that the American-led 
            bombardment of Iraq is unjust, immoral and illegal and that Scottish 
            and British troops should not be involved in this massacre.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4031</strong> <strong>Ben Wallace: Support for Armed 
            Forces</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the men and women 
            of Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces during the difficult and dangerous 
            task of disarming the brutal Iraqi regime and further extends its 
            support to the families and loved ones of members of the armed forces 
            based in Scotland or of Scottish units abroad during this uncertain 
            time.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Christine Grahame, John Scott, Mr Keith Harding, Stewart 
            Stevenson, David Mundell, Murdo Fraser, Alex Johnstone</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4031.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Support for Armed 
            Forces</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-4031) in the name 
            of Ben Wallace, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out from &quot;supports&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;sympathises with the men and women of Her 
            Majesty&#146;s armed services who are being placed in an unacceptably 
            difficult position by being ordered to participate in an unjust, immoral 
            and illegal bombardment and invasion of Iraq which will, according 
            to World Health Organisation estimates, result in civilian casualties 
            ranging from 100,000 to 500,000 and create in excess of two million 
            refugees and therefore believes that the best way to support Scottish 
            troops and other UK armed service personnel is to bring them home 
            immediately.&quot;</a></p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4030</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Double Ear Tagging 
            of Sheep</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with extreme concern 
            the European Commission&#146;s proposals that Scottish flockmasters 
            should &quot;double ear tag&quot; and record the individual identification 
            numbers of every sheep in the country; further notes that such proposals 
            are impractical, unworkable and unpoliceable on Scotland&#146;s extensive 
            upland and mountain sheep farms and that they would add nothing to 
            the effectiveness of either meat or disease traceability that is not 
            already achieved by current systems of flock identification, and urges 
            the Scottish Executive to work with Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to resist these proposals vigorously as being against the interests 
            of Scotland&#146;s flockmasters.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4029#</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: Community 
            Buyout of the North Harris Estate</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the historic purchase by the local community of the 55,000 acre 
            North Harris Estate on which the community lives and works; congratulates 
            the community and all involved in this community buy-out; notes that 
            this purchase would not have been possible without the invaluable 
            support from the Land Unit of the Scottish Executive, Her Majesty's 
            Government and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, and wishes both the community 
            and Mr Ian Scarr-Hall, the owner of Amhuinnsuidhe Castle, the very 
            best for the future, as they set about the task of social, economic, 
            cultural and environmental renewal.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4028</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Compensation for 
            Mesothelioma Sufferers</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the urgency of mesothelioma cases and the need to review court procedures 
            and powers in order to identify the real issues in such cases at the 
            earliest possible stage, to minimise delays in order to progress cases, 
            to encourage the use of jury trials and to facilitate interim payments 
            pending the resolution of cases.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4027</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Rights of Trade 
            Unions During War</strong>&#151;That the Parliament defends the right 
            of free trade unions to engage democratically in legitimate industrial 
            action in pursuit of their members' interests and therefore resolves 
            to oppose any move by the Lord Advocate to ban strike action by Scotland's 
            firefighters on Thursday 20 March 2003 or on any other day.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4026</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: The Antonine Wall</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament commends the decision of Historic Scotland to apply 
            for World Heritage Status for the Antonine Wall as part of a joint 
            bid with Austria, Germany and Slovakia that seeks to secure recognition 
            of, and protection for, the remaining sites that mark the boundaries 
            of the Roman Empire; applauds all those who have worked, often against

          <p><strong>S1M-4020#</strong> <strong>Elaine Thomson: Great Northern 
            Partnership and Social Inclusion Partnerships</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament commends the work done by the Great Northern Partnership 
            (GNP) in Aberdeen; notes that the GNP plays an important role in improving 
            quality of life and extending opportunities for those living there, 
            especially the community of Middlefield, and further commends social 
            inclusion partnerships across Scotland for empowering local communities.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4020.1</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Great Northern Partnership 
            and Social Inclusion Partnerships</strong>&#151;As an amendment to 
            motion (S1M-4020) in the name of Elaine Thomson, leave out from &quot;Great&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;community representatives in the Great Northern 
            Partnership in Aberdeen across all four communities served, Middlefield, 
            Fersands, Tillydrone and Printfield, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to empower local communities through the direct funding of local voluntary 
            organisations instead of the bureaucratic approach of social inclusion 
            partnerships.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4018</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: National Galleries

          <p><strong>S1M-4003#</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Island Transport</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises that reliable, regular and affordable air 
            and sea transport links are vital to the social and economic well-being 
            of the Scottish islands; welcomes the proposal from the Highlands 
            and Islands Strategic Transport Partnership for improved air services 
            in the Highlands and Islands backed by public service obligations; 
            believes that the introduction of public service obligations provides 
            an opportunity to ensure that the specified air services&#146; timetables 
            link in with those for ferry and bus services, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should take this opportunity to provide the 
            islands with a properly integrated transport service.</p>

            that promotion to the Scottish Premier League should be based on footballing 
            merit rather than arbitrarily set criteria that discriminate against 
            clubs of modest means and therefore believes that the Scottish Premier 
            League should ensure that the champions of the First Division of the 
            Scottish Football League are given the opportunity of promotion to 
            the Scottish Premier League provided they have guaranteed use of a 
            suitable stadium, whether through ownership or lease or a ground-sharing 
            arrangement.</p>
