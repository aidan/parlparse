          <p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by 
            the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information 
            to the Parliament.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24238</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive whether it has considered funding the Family 
            Fund Trust in order to facilitate disabled children taking holidays 
            and what conclusions it has reached.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24240</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive on what date the Creagan Road Bridge was 
            commissioned and on what date the bridge was completed.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24241</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether any benefit could be gained from the 
            introduction of a formal police caution system for those juveniles 
            and adults who are willing to accept full responsibility for their 
            actions, and what the reasons are for its position on this matter.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24242</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how information on juveniles who persistently 
            reoffend is tracked and held.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24243</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to answer to the question S1W-23115 
            by Lewis Macdonald on 7 March 2002, whether his use of the word &quot;prescribes&quot; 
            complies with the definition contained in the New Roads and Street 
            Works Act 1991.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24244</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive whether the Scottish Prison Service has 
            building insurance cover for HM Prison Kilmarnock.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24245</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what the annual cost of building insurance 
            cover is for HM Prison Kilmarnock.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24246</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what HM Treasury guidance the Scottish 
            Prison Service (SPS) has complied with, as referred to in paragraph 
            4 of the report by the Auditor General for Scotland in the SPS <em>Annual 
            Report and Accounts for 2000-01 </em>which states that the SPS has 
            &quot;complied with HM Treasury guidance&quot; in regard to HM Prison 
            Kilmarnock, given the statement &quot;that neither party is recognising 
            HMP Kilmarnock as a property asset with both parties claiming to have 
            transferred substantially all risk and rewards associated with ownership 
            of the property asset to each other&quot;.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24247</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S1W-23479 
            and S1W-22767 by Malcolm Chisholm on 11 March 2002, how it intends 
            to encourage contributions from the Parliament&#146;s European Committee 
            and the Parliament in advance of Her Majesty&#146;s Government contributing 
            to meetings of the EU Council of Ministers.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24248</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S1W-23479 
            and S1W-22767 by Malcolm Chisholm on 11 March 2002 regarding the confidentiality 
            of discussions between it and Her Majesty&#146;s Government, how it 
            plans to advance transparency in relation to such matters.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24249</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive in which accounts HM Prison Kilmarnock 
            appears as a &quot;property asset&quot;, given that paragraph 4 of 
            the Auditor General for Scotland&#146;s report in the Scottish Prison 
            Service <em>Annual Report and Accounts for 2000-01 </em>states that 
            the prison does not appear in the Scottish Prison Service&#146;s accounts 
            as a &quot;property asset&quot;.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24250</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what its response is to the report of the University 
            Registrar&#146;s meeting held at Stirling University on 1 March 2002, 
            which concluded that the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB) 
            is not able to &quot;separately identify awards made to Scottish students. 
            They do not collect information on nationality as part of the application 
            process. Therefore it will not be possible to prove whether £1.4 million 
            transferred from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland to the AHRB 
            is ultimately spent on Scottish students&quot; and whether the transfer 
            of postgraduate studentships in the humanities from a Scottish to 
            a UK agency represents an accountable use of taxpayer&#146;s money. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24251&#916;</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive when it will announce the result of 
            the recent consultation exercise on shellfish water designation.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-24252&#916;</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to improve the information 
            which is provided to courts in cases involving sex offending.</p>
