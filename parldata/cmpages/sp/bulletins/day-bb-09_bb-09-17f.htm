<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4870</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>UN Condemns War Crimes in Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of an official UN report that accuses Israel of deliberately using disproportionate force in the three-week operation in December 2008 and January 2009; further notes that the report, led by South African judge Richard Goldstone, found evidence &quot;indicating serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were committed by Israel during the Gaza conflict&quot;; notes the report&rsquo;s finding that that there is evidence that both Israeli and Palestinian forces committed war crimes in the conflict and that it accuses Israel of imposing &quot;a blockade which amounted to collective punishment&quot; in the lead-up to the conflict; also notes Mr Goldstone&rsquo;s recommendation that the UN Security Council seek reports within six months about its own investigations into the alleged crimes, including the potential involvement of the International Criminal Court if these reports are deemed unsatisfactory, and calls on the international community to respond to the call by President Obama earlier this year to urgently lift the siege in Gaza in tandem with a Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>Supported by: Elaine Smith<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4869</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Nova Scotia Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proclamation signed by Darrell Dexter, Premier of Nova Scotia, that &quot;Whereas it is fitting in Scotland&rsquo;s International year of Homecoming to recognize the strong historic, linguistic and cultural links Nova Scotia shares with Scotland; and whereas these links go far back to the time of Sir William Alexander, who played an important role in the beginning of European migration to Nova Scotia and is commemorated by a statue in Victoria Park, a public space located in our province&rsquo;s capital city of Halifax; and whereas through Sir William&rsquo;s personal efforts the foundation of Nova Scotia was laid by Royal Charter in 1621 through which our province later received its coat of arms and flag and in recognition that Sir William and the Knights Baronet of Nova Scotia represent a foundation of the affectionate relationship enjoyed between Nova Scotia and Scotland; and whereas it is fitting to acknowledge those who have influenced Nova Scotia&rsquo;s language, culture and heritage which, having evolved over the centuries, can be proudly acknowledged as diverse because of the vibrant cultures that have shaped our history&quot;, that 10 September 2009 be Nova Scotia Day and that Nova Scotia will continue to build on its mutual historic, linguistic, cultural and entrepreneurial ties with Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4868</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Hamilton Speakers Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hamilton Speakers Club, which held its inaugural meeting in May 1949, on its 60th anniversary; notes that the club was the first toastmasters club to be formed in Lanarkshire; further notes that the club opened up its membership to women in 1998 and that one third of its membership is now women, and wishes the club every success in the years ahead.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4867</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Ending the GDP Fetish</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, contributed to by economics professors Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, which calls for an end to &quot;GDP fetishism&quot;; believes that an economic approach focused on ever-increasing GDP to the detriment of other factors is unsustainable and has been disastrous for the wellbeing of individuals and the environment; agrees with the report that a new indicator of progress is needed, one that considers issues such as environmental protection and work/life balance as well as economic output, to rate a country&rsquo;s ability to maintain the sustainable happiness of its inhabitants; notes that, were such methodology to be used, and, as a result, GDP took into account outcomes and not just financial inputs, the United States of America&rsquo;s apparently large economic lead over France in terms of its GDP would be greatly reduced due to France&rsquo;s high-quality health service, welfare system and long holidays, all of which contribute to the wellbeing of its inhabitants; commends French President Nicolas Sarkozy for his response to the report, not least his statement that &quot;the [present economic] crisis doesn&rsquo;t only make us free to imagine other models, another future, another world. It obliges us to do so&quot;, and his instruction to France&rsquo;s national statistics body, Insee, to update its methods in accordance with the report&rsquo;s recommendations, and calls on the Scottish and UK Governments urgently to follow his lead and to encourage other countries to do so.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4866</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Nevis Bakery, Winner of the Great Taste Awards 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Nevis Bakery, Fort William, on winning the prestigious three-star Gold Great Taste Award and the Scottish Speciality regional award for its Demerara shortbread, in addition to winning one gold star for its Highland oaties and its oatcakes; commends the hard work and dedication shown by Archie and Hazel Paterson and all their staff in producing such high-quality products; notes that Nevis Bakery is one of Highlands and Islands Enterprise&rsquo;s (HIE) account-managed businesses and is currently working through a development plan with HIE to maximise its growth potential, and wishes Nevis Bakery every success for the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4865</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Skills Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Mark Nevin of Edinburgh, Richard Sagar of Langholm, Katie Watson of Hamilton and Martin Eusebi of Motherwell on their medal-winning performances, as part of the UK team, at this year&rsquo;s WorldSkills competition in Calgary, Canada; notes that WorldSkills is the biggest and toughest international skills competition for young people aged 16 to 23, with more than 51 countries taking part in 45 different skills categories this year; considers that the success of these young people has demonstrated Scotland&rsquo;s up-and-coming strength in skills areas as diverse as electrical energy, painting and decorating, catering and hospitality and mechanical engineering, and hopes that other skilled young Scots will be inspired to enter the next WorldSkills competition, scheduled to take place in London in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4864</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, which has found evidence that Israel has committed serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, actions amounting to war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity that were carefully planned in all their phases as a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish, humiliate and terrorise a civilian population and mounted a blockade that amounted to collective punishment in the lead-up to the conflict, while also finding that Palestinian groups had committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity in their repeated rocket and mortar attacks on Israel; welcomes the recommendation of the mission that the United Nations Human Rights Council submits the report to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, and believes that all parties involved in the conflict must fully investigate the allegations contained in the report if they are to deliver on the desire of their people to reach a meaningful and lasting peace.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4863</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Uist Defence Jobs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government not to proceed with proposals by QuinetiQ to run down the defence-testing establishment on Benbecula; congratulates the local taskforce led by Comraihle nan Eilean Siar and the local community in the Uists for the strong case and representations made to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government that helped secure this outcome; welcomes the visits made to the islands and to St Kilda by UK ministers in order to listen to local views during the consultation process and the vital role that the Rt Hon Jim Murphy MP played as Secretary of State for Scotland; congratulates UK ministers for the decision that they have taken, and recognises that this decision will help support the islands, retain jobs for its people, support the economy and maintain a strong defence capability for the nation and its allies.</p>
