          <P><strong>*S2M-313#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>No 
            Dumping of Nuclear Submarines in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament 
            rejects any proposal by Her Majesty's Government to dispose of nuclear 
            waste from nuclear submarines in Scotland and opposes, in particular, 
            any plans to cut up and store in Scotland any of the redundant nuclear 
            submarines currently held at Rosyth or those that will become redundant 
            in future.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr John Swinney<strong>*</strong>, Tricia Marwick<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, 
            Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Fiona

          <P> <strong>*S2M-312#</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Post 
            Office Card Accounts Failure to Recognise Scottish Bank Holidays</strong>-That 
            the Parliament deplores the operation of the post office card accounts 
            which allows double payment to be paid into card accounts to cover 
            post office closures for English bank holidays but fails to recognise 
            the operation of Scottish bank holidays; recognises that the traditional 
            system of payment book and cash account operation by individual post 
            offices coped easily with Scottish and local holidays, and notes that 
            the new system, unless altered to cater for Scottish holidays, acts 
            as yet another disincentive for Scottish customers to use post office 
            card accounts to support their local post office.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-311</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Network 
            Rail Closure of Level Crossings</strong>-That the Parliament condemns 
            the attitude of Network Rail in seeking to close level crossings in 
            Scotland without consultation; notes that this is contrary to the 
            aspirations of the Parliament to support public enjoyment of the countryside, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to ask the Secretary of State 
            for Scotland to ensure that in future there is full consultation with 
            local authorities, emergency services and outdoor recreation organisations 
            and that, in taking their views into account, a proper balance is 
            struck between safety and public access in deciding whether or not 
            to close a crossing.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-310</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>Strategic 
            Framework for Aquaculture</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 
            Scottish Executive's commitment, as set out in <em>A Partnership for 
            a Better Scotland</em>, to support an aquaculture industry that is 
            sustainable, diverse and competitive; endorses <em>A Strategic Framework 
            for Scottish Aquaculture</em>, prepared in collaboration with, and 
            supported by, a wide range of stakeholders and launched in March 2003 
            and notes the progress already achieved in addressing the priorities 
            for action listed therein, and further welcomes the Executive's continuing 
            commitment to work in partnership with industry and all the other 
            key stakeholders in regularly reviewing and reporting to the Parliament 
            progress with the monitoring and implementation of the full programme 
            of work contained in the strategic framework.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-309</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Mercy 
            and Percile Ikolo</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the SNP 
            on dedicating its party business this week to debating the Parliament's 
            attitude to Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre; condemns the fact 
            that Mercy Ikolo and her daughter Percile were detained at Dungavel 
            until being freed on bail last week, although they have a home in 
            Ireland where Percile was born; further condemns the fact that while 
            detained there they were threatened with removal to Uganda, and believes 
            that serious questions about the abuse of the human rights of children 
            like Percile, detained at Dungavel, have to be raised.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-308#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Family History Week 18 to 24 April 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the decision of Scotland's local history societies to hold 
            a local history week from 18 to 24 April 2004 with a focus on graveyards; 
            notes the great public interest in local and family history, and encourages 
            the Scottish Executive and&nbsp;local authorities to be involved in 
            promoting these events as part of the genealogy tourism initiative.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-307</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>HM 
            Inspectorate of Education Report on Children Detained at Dungavel 
            Immigration Removal Centre</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            report by HM Inspectorate of Education on the education provision 
            for children detained at Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre; notes 
            that 79 children were held for periods in excess of two weeks and 
            36 children in excess of six weeks over the period of the report; 
            further notes the report's conclusion that the education provision 
            made at the centre was only acceptable for children detained for up 
            to two weeks and unsatisfactory for those detained more than six weeks, 
            and urges Her Majesty's Government to take immediate action on the 
            report and in particular to end the compulsory detention of children 
            at Dungavel.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-306</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Chile</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the events taking place on 11 and 13 September 
            2003, sponsored by Amnesty International, Chile Democratico and the 
            STUC, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the military coup that 
            brought down the democratic government of President Salvador Allende 
            in Chile on 11 September 1973; remembers the thousands of Chileans 
            who were killed, detained, tortured and exiled by General Pinochet's 
            brutal regime; expresses renewed solidarity with them, their friends 
            and relatives; supports their demands for truth and justice as the 
            necessary building blocks of the new Chile; pays tribute to the people 
            of Chile who struggled for almost 17 years to return their country 
            to democratic rule and to the Scottish people who supported that struggle; 
            re-affirms a commitment to providing refuge and asylum to people, 
            like the Chileans who came to Scotland in the mid 1970s, who are fleeing 
            persecution and need a safe haven to rebuild lives shattered by oppression, 
            war and conflict in their homelands; values their contribution to 
            Scottish society and the enriching diversity they bring to our country; 
            pledges on-going support for the cause of democracy, human, civil 
            and political rights everywhere in the world, and calls for an end 
            to oppression, discrimination and exclusion of any kind worldwide.</P>

            leave out from "deplores" to end and insert "notes that motion S2M-302
