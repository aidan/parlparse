<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>*S2M-5126</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Lord Phillips&rsquo; Comments that Torture is Forgivable</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments of Lord Phillips, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, in a speech to the University of Hertfordshire, delivered on 19 October 2006, when he indicated that in his opinion it might be acceptable for individuals to be tortured to reveal information and that there are situations where &quot;the executive might be forgiven for acting in a manner that was unlawful&quot; and calls on the Scottish Executive to make clear that it or its law officers will never sanction or condone the use of torture in any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5125</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Escalating Costs of the 2012 Olympic Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the organisers of the 2012 London Olympics are likely to be hit with a VAT bill on top of the cost of preparing for the games, originally estimated at &pound;2.4 billion and recently estimated at closer to &pound;5 billion; notes that this VAT bill, which Tessa Jowell MP has admitted was not factored into the original costs, may be around &pound;250 million alone; believes that Scottish charitable causes and grassroots sport should not be affected by either the increase in cost or the unexpected VAT bill by facing further displacement of lottery monies to contribute to these costs, and calls on the Scottish Executive to intimate this position clearly to both the organisers of the 2012 London Olympics and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5124</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Holytown Primary School Supports Malawi</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the outstanding efforts of the pupils of room 14 at Holytown Primary School, Lanarkshire, in raising over &pound;700 for their food aid project for Malawi; notes that the pupils conducted an assembly, to which the local community was invited, which highlighted the levels of poverty in Malawi, and sends its best wishes to the school&rsquo;s head teacher, Morag Johnston, who will be visiting Malawi in February 2007 to support educational initiatives in that country.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5123</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Fireworks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing distress caused to residents and their pets by fireworks; recognises that restrictions on the sale of fireworks at New Year and for a three-week period prior to 5 November under the Fireworks Act 2003 do not prevent the abuse of fireworks at this time and during other times of the year when it is still too prevalent, and believes that the time has come to have a complete ban on the sale of fireworks, except for organised displays where a licence can be granted by local authorities.</p>
<p>Supported by: Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5122</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>MSP Pension Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the pension fund for MSPs should be invested ethically and therefore calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to investigate ways of amending the pension fund rules to make this possible and to report to the Parliament with recommendations on the best way to achieve this.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5121</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Welcome to First Socialist Ever Elected to US Senate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its warmest congratulations to Senator Bernie Sanders, the newly elected socialist member of the US Senate; notes his remarkable victory in Vermont where he won 66% of the popular vote; notes that he is the only elected member of the Senate never to have belonged to either the Republican or Democratic parties and believes that his overwhelming success in part reflects the tidal wave of opposition rushing through America over the continued occupation of Iraq by US troops and equally shows the strength of support that there is there for his pioneering and progressive social policies and political record in representing working families in Vermont over the last two decades.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5120</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Saving Live Music on Radio 3</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the proposal to end the broadcasting of live concerts on Radio 3 outside the Prom season; believes that live concerts are an essential part of the BBC&rsquo;s musical remit; is concerned that ending the broadcasting of live music will reduce the choice of classical music available to listeners and could reduce the number of such concerts, especially in Scotland; believes that it might also reduce the BBC&rsquo;s commissioning of new music and jeopardise the future of its orchestras and singers; reminds the BBC that its broadcasting policy should not be the plaything of particular controllers; insists that its management undertakes a proper consultation with its listeners and the classical music community before any final decisions are taken, and calls on the BBC&rsquo;s governors to take this final opportunity before they are abolished to make a stand against yet another example of the dumbing down of the BBC&rsquo;s cultural programming.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5119</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the First Socialist Senator</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Bernie Sanders on being elected the first socialist senator in the United States of America; notes that Bernie has a long and distinguished history of fighting on socialist issues, including opposing the Vietnam war, developing day-care and teen centres, developing after-school programmes, fighting for low and moderate-income housing, the rights of tenants and community land-trust housing, attacking repressive tax structures and fighting for environmental improvements including renewable energy schemes; recognises that this victory represents a real step forward for socialism in America, and looks forward to congratulating many more such socialists in the Senate.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5118</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Air Ambulance Cover in the Highlands and Islands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern reports that the Scottish Ambulance Service is trying to restrict the number of missions flown by its Inverness-based air ambulance helicopter by using the helicopter only when a road ambulance cannot access the site and even then only when authorisation is granted by the head of the air ambulance service; believes that such action will inevitably delay the arrival in hospital of patients in need of urgent medical treatment; further believes that this is the result of the reduction in the number of air ambulance aircraft in Scotland, in particular the loss of an air ambulance based in Orkney which has left the Inverness helicopter covering a much enlarged area, and calls on the Scottish Executive to instruct the Scottish Ambulance Service to base an additional air ambulance aircraft in Kirkwall as a matter of urgency so that adequate levels of air ambulance cover in the Highlands and Islands can be restored.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5117#</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Respect Your Life, Not a Knife</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 27 November 2006 is the sixth anniversary of the tragic death of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor, a young immigrant from Nigeria who moved to the United Kingdom with his sister and his mother, while his father stayed behind, in order to make better lives for themselves, and who three months later was murdered in London, England, on his way home from his local library; conveys its deepest sympathies to his surviving family and congratulates them on ensuring that this young man&rsquo;s legacy lives on in the Damilola Taylor Trust, a not-for-profit organisation that has launched a campaign to reduce knife violence by getting secondary schools to encourage students to sign a pledge wall stating that they will not carry weapons; agrees that the goals of the campaign, namely to commit young people not to carry weapons and to demonstrate to those who do that the majority of young people do not want to carry weapons, are both laudable and practical; congratulates local organisations in Scotland, such as the Community Alcohol Free Environment (CAF&Eacute; Project) initiative in Angus and other local organisations that are trying to bring the campaign to Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should offer its full assistance and support to encouraging the spread of this community-led initiative to schools throughout Scotland to spread the &quot;Respect your Life, Not a Knife&quot; message.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5116</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Montrose Maternity Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its congratulations to Montrose Maternity Unit&rsquo;s midwifery team which recently won the <em>British Journal of Midwifery </em>Team of the Year award in London; recognises that this is yet another feather in the caps of the unit&rsquo;s midwives who have also recently won the Royal College of Midwives&rsquo; Promotion of Normality award for assisting in a record number of straightforward births, and further congratulates all midwives across Scotland on the invaluable role that they play within the healthcare system and in ensuring that Scotland&rsquo;s future generations are looked after before, during and after birth.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5115</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Opening of The Macallan Whisky Development in Speyside</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the new &pound;1 million development in Speyside by Edrington, owners of The Macallan single malt, which includes a new visitor centre and the restored 18th century Jacobean manor, Easter Elchies House; congratulates Edrington on the growth of The Macallan which has increased sales at three times the rate of the single malt market over the last five years, and recognises the important role that whisky plays in the manufacturing, transportation and tourism industries in Moray and across Scotland, resulting in whisky contributing &pound;2 billion a year to the balance of trade.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5114</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh - Showing the Way to a Low Carbon Future?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of a report on decentralised energy, commissioned by the City of Edinburgh Council, Greenpeace UK and WWF Scotland, suggesting that Edinburgh could become a world leader in the fight against climate change; notes the findings of the report that if Edinburgh implements its recommendations to opt for a decentralised energy system, using micro-renewable energy generation and combined heat and power (CHP), it could meet all of its energy needs, slash carbon dioxide emissions and save money, without the use of new nuclear power; contrasts the decentralised model with the present system used in the United Kingdom, whereby the vast majority of electricity comes from large, centralised and grossly inefficient thermal power stations that waste around two-thirds of their energy inputs; believes that, as long as fossil fuels are used to generate electricity, both generators and consumers of energy have a responsibility to ensure that this finite and polluting energy is used as efficiently as possible; acknowledges that decentralised energy is a tried and tested system which is already widely used across many parts of Europe, where combined heat and power networks are commonplace, and calls for other cities across Scotland and the rest of the UK to follow this example and to adopt a decentralised energy system fit for the 21st century.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5113</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>St Andrew&rsquo;s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the St Andrew&rsquo;s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5112</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>World COPD Day 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets that there are an estimated 2.1 million people in the United Kingdom who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but remain undiagnosed, 95,000 of whom live in Scotland; welcomes the British Lung Foundation&rsquo;s campaign for World COPD Day 2006 which aims to find these &quot;missing millions&quot; so that they can be diagnosed early and treated to halt the progression of their disease; regrets that Scotland is the only country in the UK which has not yet taken steps to develop specific policies to improve care for patients with respiratory disease, and supports calls by the British Lung Foundation Scotland for NHS Quality Improvement Scotland to develop clinical standards for COPD to ensure that people living with the condition have access to the best quality care, regardless of where in the country they live.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5111</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Scottish Shinty/Hurling Victors in Ireland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the Scotland shinty team in its historic win in Ireland in the Shinty/Hurling international at Croke Park on 5 November 2006 by 19 (2-13) to 11 (2-05); notes that this was the first victory for Scotland at Croke Park and that this was the second successive year that Scotland won the international; calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise this achievement by giving the requisite funding to grow the game in its Highland heartland as well as across Scotland, and looks forward to another exciting shinty/hurling international in Fort William next October during the Scottish Year of Highland Culture.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5110</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Lack of Democracy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the situation whereby Members&rsquo; Bills face undemocratic barriers to their passage through the parliamentary system; notes with concern that more and more stringent measures are being put in place with regard to Members&rsquo; Bills thus weakening the basic democracy of the Parliament; recognises that the production of a Member&rsquo;s Bill involves a considerable amount of time and public money including the cost of both parliamentary and party staff, and calls for an immediate review of the way in which Members&rsquo; Bills are supported through the parliamentary system including a review of the Standing Orders of the Parliament with regard to Members&rsquo; Bills and their progress through the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5109.1</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Violence Against Women</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5109) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;and, in so doing, expresses continuing concern at the despairingly low conviction rates for rape and sexual offences and the continuing humiliation that the majority of women complainants face through the courts allowing examination of victims&rsquo; sexual history and character, and believes that the efforts of the Executive to address male violence against women must be supported by effective change in the criminal justice system.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5109.2</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Violence Against Women</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5109) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;notes that in 2004-05 there were only 234 refuge places in Scotland and calls on the Executive to provide increased funding to support additional places which will also take into account rurality and remoteness, and further calls on the Executive to review the operation of the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5105.1</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Funding Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5105) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;calls on the Scottish Executive to facilitate discussions between COSLA, local authorities and trade unions to deliver a fair and speedy resolution to the equal pay and single status issue and to ensure that the implications of such agreement are reflected in the 2007-08 local authority financial settlement.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5105.2</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>Funding Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5105) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the principles of the Equal Pay Act 1970; condemns the failure of local authorities and trades unions to reach agreement on the implementation of single status; recognises the importance of protecting taxpayers at all levels from the consequences of this failure, and calls on the Scottish Executive to exert pressure on local authorities and trades unions to reach an agreement fair to employees and taxpayers.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5105.3</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Funding Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5105) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, insert at end &quot;further offers 100% solidarity to those workers in Glasgow and other local authorities who are compelled to ballot on industrial action in opposition to unacceptable changes in working conditions and contracts being imposed by local authorities which have waited far too long to act on equal pay and are now further penalising low-paid workers by attacking their meagre wages in order to fund the pay increases of other low-paid workers.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5105.4</strong> <strong>George Lyon:</strong> <strong>Funding Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5105) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that closing the equal pay gap will benefit all Scots, Scotland&rsquo;s workplaces and Scotland&rsquo;s economy; agrees that it is the responsibility of local authorities as independent bodies to implement the single status pay agreement which they themselves negotiated, and encourages employers and unions to make every effort to reach an agreement that is fair and equitable and protects the staff concerned, council taxpayers and the services that local authorities deliver.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5104.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Housing Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5104) in the name of Colin Fox, leave out from first &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the transfer of local government housing to communities run by locally accountable housing associations, co-operatives and companies and notes the recent Audit Scotland report which concluded that the handover of more than 100,000 council homes to new landlords since 1998 has brought more investment in properties and promoted tenant control as well as facilitating increased repairs and maintenance and the building of new homes and keeping rent increases down; therefore urges all tenants to seriously consider voting for the stock transfer of their homes, but notes, however, that the Scottish Executive now needs to address urgently the issues preventing the second stage transfer in Glasgow and to publish what it and the City of Edinburgh Council now plan to do for the future of Edinburgh&rsquo;s housing stock, with a view to assisting in future investment for vital affordable housing.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5104.2</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Housing Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5104) in the name of Colin Fox, leave out from first &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the failure of the Scottish Executive to adequately fund Scottish housing and its refusal to consider any other funding options than large-scale voluntary transfer; deplores the lack of real choice offered to Scottish tenants; condemns the Executive&rsquo;s failure to deliver the promise of second-stage transfer to the tenants of Glasgow Housing Association, and calls on the Minister for Communities to make immediate representations to the UK Treasury for the write-off of local authorities&rsquo; capital housing debt without preconditions.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5104.3</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Housing Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5104) in the name of Colin Fox, insert at end &quot;further believes that building new good-quality and affordable homes to rent without ending the damaging right-to-buy policy will not produce a sustainable supply of houses to rent in the future, and therefore believes that right-to-buy discounts should be replaced immediately with right-to-rent discounts at the same rate to reward long-term tenants and encourage demand in the rented sector, that houses under local authority control and management represent real social and community ownership and democratic control and that all tenants misled into supporting stock transfer in Glasgow and the Western Isles should be offered the opportunity of returning to council control via democratic ballot.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5104.4</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Housing Stock Transfer</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5104) in the name of Colin Fox, leave out from first &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;commends the initiatives by the Scottish Executive to increase the quantity of affordable housing in Scotland through its increased investment programme, which will deliver over 16,500 new affordable homes for rent and nearly 5,000 for low-cost home ownership by 2008, and through its Homestake low-cost home ownership scheme and its use of the planning system to increase supply; supports the principle of housing transfer to community ownership to improve the quality of existing housing where this has the support of the tenants; agrees that transfer has the potential to deliver a substantial package of benefits for tenants, including increased investment in their homes, rent guarantees and a much greater say in how their homes are managed, and recognises that transfer is indeed now delivering substantial new investment for tenants, as confirmed by Audit Scotland.&quot;</p>
