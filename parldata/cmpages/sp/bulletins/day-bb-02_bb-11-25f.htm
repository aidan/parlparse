          <p><strong>*S1M-3632</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Pollution of Scotland's 
            Seas</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the Irish Government, 
            on the occasion of the meeting of the British-Irish Council at New 
            Lanark, in its legal case against the UK Government in regard to nuclear 
            pollution from the British Nuclear Fuels Ltd site at Sellafield, England.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3631#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow City 
            Council's Withdrawal of Bulk Refuse Uplift Service</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision by Glasgow City 
            Council to withdraw its bulk refuse uplift service from back court 
            areas of property managed by housing associations and housing co-operatives 
            and to only uplift bulk items when housing associations agree to purchase 
            back court cleaning services from the council; further notes that 
            this decision was imposed despite representations that the decision 
            be deferred until the end of the current financial year and that the 
            new arrangement to leave bulk refuse on the pavement on specific days 
            for collection is a recipe for disaster, with the consequence that 
            bulk refuse is now accumulating in back court areas, constituting 
            a nuisance, danger and environmental hazard to residents and property, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations 
            to the council that it should, as a matter of urgency, come to an 
            agreement with housing associations to restore the bulk refuse uplift 
            service. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3630#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie: Assisting Those 
            with Impaired Communication</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            the Clinical Research and Audit Group report published in 1997 <em>The 
            provision of and support for alternative and augmentative communication 
            (AAC) in Scotland: equipment and services</em>; welcomes the Adults 
            with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 with its emphasis on communication; 
            applauds the augmentative communication programme of the Forth Valley 
            NHS Rehabilitation Service, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should fund research into the needs of those with impaired communication 
            and end the underfunding of augmentative communication in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3629</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Bioinformatics 
            and Opportunities for All</strong>&#151;That the Parliament applauds 
            the announcement on 20 November 2002 by the Department of trade and 
            Industry on its Beacon Project grant of £940,000, as part of the &quot;Harnessing 
            Genomics&quot; Programme announced in the &quot;Opportunities for 
            All&quot; White Paper of April 2001, to support collaborative inter-disciplinary 
            research work which sees scientists and academics from computing, 
            information and mathematical sciences, the Institute for Biology and 
            Life Sciences and the Beatson Cancer Research UK Institute at the 
            University of Glasgow working together to develop software that will 
            simulate and analyse the chemistry of the body; notes that these projects 
            offer the prospect of developing new techniques to tackle diseases 
            including cancer, arteriosclerosis, stroke, heart disease and chronic 
            inflammatory and degenerative diseases and have the potential to revolutionise 
            the future of healthcare, and affirms that this research work capitalises 
            on the excellent science base available in this country and will help 
            the United Kingdom maintain our global position at the leading edge 
            of bioscience and biotechnology while supporting the development of 
            new technologies that enhance the future competitiveness of UK industry.

          <p><strong>*S1M-3628#</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson: Edinburgh 
            Direct Aid</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the charity 
            group Edinburgh Direct Aid on its many years of providing aid throughout 
            the states of the former Yugoslavia and Albania, and applauds its 
            decision to seek to provide aid to the Palestinian people during this 
            period of heightened tension.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3627</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Straight 
            Out Advisory Group</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the 
            work of the Straight Out Advisory Group (SOAG) in co-ordinating and 
            assisting the delivery of social justice within the Paisley Social 
            Inclusion Partnership (SIP) area; recognises the particular emphasis 
            SOAG places on assisting the most excluded young people resident in 
            the SIP area to return to active citizenship, through, for example, 
            the devising of pre-vocational and personal development support, in 
            the form of counselling aimed at tackling an individual&#146;s offending 
            behaviour such as substance abuse and anger management, for former 
            offenders that require additional assistance to join local training 
            and employment projects; notes that the programme was the product 
            of research by Scottish Enterprise, which stated that 80% of employers 
            would not recruit someone with a known offending background; acknowledges 
            the support given to SOAG by the Job Centre Plus Service which identifies 
            the group as a crucial resource in cutting the number of men that 
            sleep rough, fail to seek employment, or present themselves as destitute 
            within the first week of their release from prison, and understands 
            the difficulty faced by fast-growing organisations such as SOAG in 
            maintaining the momentum of current claims and meeting the needs of 
            new recruits.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3626#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty: Regeneration of 
            the Clyde</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the importance 
            to Scotland of efforts to regenerate the Clyde; congratulates <em>The 
            Herald</em> for initiating a public debate on the subject; considers 
            that the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise should establish 
            and resource a development framework for the Clyde which encourages 
            joined-up thinking and action; further considers that the respective 
            councils, enterprise companies, regeneration agencies and private 
            developers should work co-operatively in reclaiming derelict land, 
            ensuring adequate flood protection and improving the transport infrastructure, 
            and believes that ministers should make the regeneration of the Clyde 
            one of the top economic, environmental and social justice priorities 
            for Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3625 Alex Neil on behalf of the Enterprise and Lifelong 
            Learning Committee: Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, <em>Final 
            Report on Lifelong Learning</em></strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the 9th Report 2002 of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
            Committee, <em>Final Report on Lifelong Learning</em> (SP Paper 679), 
            and invites the Scottish Executive to take the report into account 
            when developing the new strategy. </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3624</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Anticoagulation Medication 
            Strips on Prescription</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            Scotland has a significant and growing number of patients who require 
            oral anticoagulation medication to avoid potentially fatal bleeding 
            or clotting; recognises that diagnostic technology enables these patients 
            to self-monitor their blood-clotting times in order to determine the 
            correct dose of anticoagulation medication, at considerable saving 
            to the NHS and convenience to the patient; notes that anticoagulation 
            monitoring strips are available on prescription in England, Wales 
            and Northern Ireland but not yet in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to make such strips available on prescription in Scotland 
            without further delay.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3623#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Glasgow to 
            Barra Air Link Public Service Obligation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the decision to award a public service obligation 
            order to the Glasgow to Barra air link for one year only; recognises 
            that such orders are normally awarded for three years; further recognises 
            the concern felt in Barra that this constitutes a major threat to 
            the long-term future of the air service which, in turn, could engender 
            more social and economic decline in an area already affected by depopulation, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should reinstate the order 
            for three years.</p>

            make the new Parliament building bomb-proof, which has already cost 
            approximately £28 million and threatens to result in much more cost

            is dissatisfied with the long delays frequently occurring in the process

            of the government department involved in the process and urges the

            place on Thursday 21 November 2002, at 3:30pm in the Scottish Parliament&#146;s

            the Levenmouth Drug and Alcohol Project in Fife on successfully gaining 
            Investors in People recognition following an independent assessment,

            Research Institute report <em>An Assessment of the Economic Impact 
            of the Skye Bridge Tolls </em>shows that the tolls are having a negative 
            effect on the Skye and Lochalsh economy, and calls for the tolls to 
            be removed entirely or at least reduced in line with the toll regimes

            young people and school children on the growing social, personal and 
            health problems associated with underage drinking; notes that many 
            of the youngsters that have attended the project's counselling programmes 
            have benefited from their participation; further notes that they and 
            their parents now have a greater awareness and a more sensible view

            interest in the project's work from as far away as the New Zealand 
            Police, and believes that such initiatives dealing with alcohol and 
            substance misuse amongst children and young people should receive 
            appropriate support from the Scottish Executive.</p>

            Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) consultation on the General 
            Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS); notes that GATS covers many 
            areas that are within the Parliament&#146;s legislative competence, 
            and believes that all interested parties across Scotland should submit

          <p> <strong>S1M-3609</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Vascular Disease 
            in Elderly People and the Findings of PROSPER</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament welcomes the findings of PROSPER, the prospective study 
            of pravastatin in the elderly at risk, undertaken by a team of leading 
            international scientists from the University of Glasgow, University 
            College Cork, Ireland, and Universiteit Leiden, the Netherlands, and 
            their examination of the hypothesis that pravastatin will reduce heart 
            attack and stroke events in elderly subjects with existing vascular 
            disease or at high risk of developing the condition, presented at 
            the American Heart Association Conference on 18 November 2002 in Chicago, 
            USA; recognises that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of 
            death and disability in elderly people and is also a major contributor 
            to cognitive decline and dementia, both important public health issues 
            for medical care for older people; notes that, while the benefits 
            of statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular events such as heart 
            attack and stroke in middle age are already recognised, its value 
            for citizens in the over&#150;70s age group had never previously been 
            closely scrutinised, and calls on the Scottish Executive, working 
            together with NHS boards, to assess the potential effects of a statin 
            in reducing the risks of coronary heart disease, stroke and their 
            consequences in patients at high risk aged 70 and older, so that current 
            vascular risk management strategies for the middle-aged might be extended 
            to elderly people who currently represent the largest group of undertreated 
            individuals in our communities. </p>

            the Parliament condemns the Bill tabled in the Israeli Parliament, 
            the Knesset, on 29 October 2002 by the chair of the Israeli Government 
            coalition, MK Zeev Boim, to secure impunity for war criminals, outlaw 
            human rights activities, imprison human rights activists for up to 
            ten years and destroy evidence of war crimes; notes that such a law, 
            if passed, would forbid "the holding of investigations and writing 
            down of results" and that any association engaging in any such activity 
            would be liable to be disbanded, effectively closing down any action 
            by human rights organisations to collect and then disseminate testimonies 
            of human rights violations; expresses grave concern that such proposals 
            would sabotage the work of Israeli human rights activists assisting 
            international war crimes tribunals at the Hague and make illegal the 
            courageous and conscientious actions of individual citizens of Israel, 
            and calls on MSPs to protest in the strongest terms to members of

            for revealing, as attributed to him in <em>The Herald</em> magazine

            did not employ an architect who was able to describe what he was doing

            quite deliberately didn&#146;t give you all the info&quot;; expresses 
            regret that the Chief Architect should have kept hidden until the

            the true nature of Enric Miralles&#146; illness which &quot;threatened 
            the future of the whole Parliament&quot;, and further regrets deeply 
            that, deprived of full information on Enric Miralles and an independent

            the Parliament notes the opinion attributed in <em>The Herald</em> magazine 
            on 16 November 2002 to the Holyrood Project Director that &quot;negotiating&quot; 
            with the MSPs elected in May 1999 over a parliament building designed 
            to meet their requirements would have been likely to result in the 
            site for the new parliament still being undetermined in November 2002; 
            records its confidence in its ability to reach democratic decisions 
            on projects or policies which, constitutionally, are executed by officials 
            of either the Scottish Executive or the Parliament and which, in the 
            course of such a process, may be the subject of private, professional 
            exchanges between elected ministers and MSPs but should never be the 
            subject of public pronouncement on the part of officials whether in 
            relation to the credibility or value of the project or policy or the 
            abilities of those elected MSPs responsible for it, and questions 
            whether the Holyrood Project Director is a fit person to execute Parliament&#146;s

            family planning and health screening services to women; is further 
            concerned that any closure of that clinic will require women to travel 
            by two buses to the other side of the city in order to access an alternative
