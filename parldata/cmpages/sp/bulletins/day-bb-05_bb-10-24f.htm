<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&#117;
  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3440</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Equality Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the principles contained in the provisions of the Equality Bill, including the power to impose duties on public authorities, so far as those provisions relate to matters within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or confer functions on the Scottish Ministers, and agrees that those provisions should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3439</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>A Real Community Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to consider creating a real Community Fund to allow community groups to directly receive funding for projects that will enhance community activities and facilities in neighbourhoods throughout Scotland.</p>

<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3437</strong> <strong>George Lyon:</strong> <strong>Licensing (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Licensing (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3436</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Management of Offenders etc. (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Management of Offenders etc. (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>

<p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3434</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>North Lanarkshire Carers Together</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends North Lanarkshire Carers Together for the work it conducts which aims to raise the profile of carers and improve awareness of carers&rsquo; issues and concerns; congratulates it for improving the lives of carers in North Lanarkshire and providing a voice for carers in the planning of future services; applauds its outstanding record at influencing change both at a local and national level, and encourages the Scottish Executive to continue funding North Lanarkshire Carers Together through carers development money allocated to North Lanarkshire when its funding is due for review in March 2006.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3433</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Location of Slow Food UK Office</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the UK Slow Food Association was founded at a congress held on Skye in August 2005; notes that the Slow Food Movement is an international organisation with a growing profile (the movement&rsquo;s founder, Carlo Petrini, was on <em>Time</em> <em>Magazine&rsquo;s</em> list of European heroes last year); notes that Fiona Richmond from Edinburgh has been appointed as Slow Food UK&rsquo;s first director and believes that Edinburgh should bid to host the UK office of the Slow Food Movement as the enhancement of Edinburgh&rsquo;s reputation as a destination serious about real food would be considerable; commends moves to provide office space and sponsorship for the Slow Food UK office, and believes that changing Scotland&rsquo;s food culture is important in improving the lives of Scottish people and the Scottish environment.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3432</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Stirling Award for Architecture</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, to mark the occasion of the Scottish Parliament building gaining the prestigious Stirling award for architecture, congratulates all those involved in the design and completion of the building, especially the late Enric Miralles, Benedetta Tagliabue, RMJM, Bovis, the subcontractors, the skilled workers who finished the building to such a high standard, and Ben Dawson for the furnishings, especially in the Chamber and committee rooms, and acknowledges, in light of the Stirling award and growing praise from around the world, that Scotland can be proud to have a building that is, and will remain, a construction of international renown and an icon of architectural and artistic genius and excellence.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3431</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Fish Stocks in North Sea, ICES Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent report from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) on fish stocks in the North Sea; commends the painstaking work that it and European marine scientists have done over recent years; notes that the threats to fish stocks in the North Sea are as serious as ever; recalls that the accord signed by European fisheries ministers last year committed to the possibility of instituting closed areas in the North Sea if the situation had not improved, and, in the interests of future fish stocks and of the fishermen themselves, calls upon the Scottish Executive to keep an open mind on the advisability of setting up no-take zones in order to allow stocks to regenerate, particularly in relation to the cod fishery, and to provide all consequent and sensible assistance to fishermen and their families to minimise the economic effects of any measures taken.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3430</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with British Columbian Teachers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends solidarity greetings to all members of the British Columbia Teachers&rsquo; Federation who are currently pursuing industrial action against their employer, the British Columbian Provincial Government; is appalled that their employer legislated away their right to negotiate their due pay settlement and subsequently deemed their legitimate strike action illegal; recognises that over 90% of 40,000 teachers voted for strike action, knowing it was technically illegal; commends their courageous stand; welcomes the solidarity of other workers which saw over 100,000 out in support of the teachers and against the British Columbian Government&rsquo;s cuts in education and other public services; believes that the actions of the British Columbian Government undermine the province&rsquo;s international reputation which is regrettable in the run-up to its hosting of the 2010 Winter Olympics, and hopes that the British Columbian Government agrees to negotiate and put forward a resolution to this dispute acceptable to the teachers.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3429</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>PPP Schools Projects and the Loss of Open Space in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the report from the Holmhills Wood Community Park Action Group on PPP school modernisation projects and the loss of open space in Scotland; expresses concern at the figures showing possibly over a hundred open community spaces in the process of being lost, or already lost; expresses alarm at the lack of reliable information available from local authorities, in particular that 29 out of 32 authorities hold no collated records of information on loss of open space and only five authorities were able to provide any information at all on open space loss over the last six years; notes the lack of auditing, failures of the planning system, failures of the statutory consultation system, failure of the Scottish Executive to effectively monitor PPP projects in relation to loss of open space and failure of the procurement document for PPP schools to make any mention of environmental sustainability, and calls on the Executive to institute a moratorium on all PPP schools projects still in the planning stage, or proposed, until such time as a proper audit of open space loss has taken place and strict new guidelines have been issued to all Scottish local authorities on future and present PPP schools projects, especially in relation to open spaces and environmental sustainability.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3428</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Occupation of Tibet</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the forthcoming state visit of China&rsquo;s President, Hu Jintao, in November 2005; urges the Prime Minister to encourage President Hu to meet the Dalai Lama in order to resolve China&rsquo;s long-standing occupation of Tibet, and further calls on the Prime Minister publicly to state his concerns on Tibet during the course of the state visit.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3427</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Comments by the Immigration Minister</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments made by Tony McNulty MP, Minister of State for Immigration and Citizenship, on 16 October 2005 that &quot;We are not knocking down doors at four in the morning&hellip; Most of the removals occur at about half five, half six or seven in the morning&hellip;in no sense at all can what the dedicated public servants of the immigration service do in very difficult circumstances like removal be described as inhuman or terrorising children&quot;; notes that Kathleen Marshall, Scotland&rsquo;s Commissioner for Children and Young People, has already condemned the practice of dawn raids; further notes that Jack McConnell MSP, the First Minister, has already acknowledged the existence of so-called &quot;dawn raids&quot; and has condemned the practice, and considers Mr McNulty&rsquo;s comments to show little understanding of the reality of the situation for families, such as the recently deported Vucaj family.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3426</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Bert Mullen - Credit Union Pioneer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament wishes to pay tribute to the work of Bert Mullen (1920-1986), who was instrumental in the establishment of Western Credit Union, based in the Drumchapel area and widely acknowledged as Scotland&rsquo;s first credit union, which has now grown into Drumchapel Community Credit Union, with over 2,500 senior and 500 junior members; acknowledges the role which Mr Mullen played as the first Scottish Director of the Credit Union League of Great Britain in the development of the movement nationally; notes that Nobel Peace Prize Winner, John Hume, will give the inaugural Bert Mullen Lecture on 20 October 2005, International Credit Union Day, and salutes the dedication and effort of those who, like Mr Mullen, pioneered the use of the unique credit union model to provide a source of affordable credit and encourage regular savings in their local communities.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3424</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>MRSA Swab Testing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the introduction of a swab test to detect MRSA which has been developed by Heartland Hospital in Birmingham; notes that the results take two hours to obtain; notes that other tests for MRSA can take up to 48 hours to give results and that in this time the infection could spread to other patients, and believes that the Minister for Health and Community Care has a duty of care to those in Scottish hospitals and that there should be a trial of the swab kit in Scotland, in parallel to that recently announced in England.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3423</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Amnesty International&rsquo;s Protect the Human Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Amnesty International&rsquo;s (AI) Protect the Human Week from 16 to 22 October 2005; welcomes the organisation&rsquo;s recent report on the detention of people who have sought asylum in the United Kingdom and congratulates the many schools across Scotland which will be holding a Refugees&rsquo; Voices assembly; realises that the impetus behind this awareness-raising week is to highlight the fact that there has been an increase in the number of people seeking asylum who are being detained under immigration law and that a large number of them are asylum-seeking families with children; is concerned that AI&rsquo;s report points out that there are no comprehensive statistics on the number of those who have sought asylum who are held in detention or the length of time they are detained; shares the concerns of AI that the risk of absconding is being used as the justification for detention without meaningful assessment; calls on the Scottish Executive to use its limited powers to influence the government at Westminster to take notice of AI&rsquo;s report, to properly assess asylum claimants and to have consideration for these people as human beings with rights and feelings, and further asks the Executive to consider getting the full powers of immigration devolved to Scotland so that the Scottish governing bodies can implement Scottish solutions and have a specifically tailored Scottish approach to immigration and asylum.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3421</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>SPRING Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the regeneration of Springhill Park in Aberdeen following a &pound;50,000 award from the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Greenspace Scotland fund; welcomes the renaming of the park as the Eric Hendrie Park, in tribute to Councillor Eric Hendrie who died last year, and congratulates the SPRING group which has successfully worked to secure these improvements to the park to create an invaluable asset for the local community.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3418</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Use of Scottish Airports by CIA Rendition Flights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the information from the US Federal Aviation Administration concerning the use of Scottish airports by CIA rendition flights which states that such flights have stopped at Prestwick Airport on 75 occasions and Glasgow Airport 74 times; notes that these flights transport terror suspects for interrogation in countries where torture is accepted and even commonplace; notes that torture has been illegal since 1984 under the UN Convention Against Torture, and calls on the Scottish Executive urgently to investigate and report on all CIA rendition flights that have used Scottish airports and to make a statement regarding what measures are being taken to ensure that Scotland is not complicit in, nor guilty of, aiding and abetting torture.</p>
