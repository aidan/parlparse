                                        <p> <strong>S3M-5694</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Strathclyde Taser Pilot</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the decision of the Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police to issue Taser guns to 30 frontline police officers following a three-day training course; notes the considerable concerns about the safety of Tasers raised by Amnesty International; further notes that at present Tasers are only issued to specially trained, authorised firearms officers as an additional less lethal option to conventional firearms; recognises that in order to become an authorised firearms officer a police officer must be selected and trained in order to reach the required level of competency in weapon handling, tactical knowledge, shooting skills and judgment and is thereafter subject to refresher training and re-qualification; further notes that, when a similar pilot took place in 10 police forces in England and Wales in 2007-08, Tasers were used by officers 661 times within a year and that they were used on children 34 times during this period; recognises that it was the Home Secretary who signed off on issuing Tasers to more frontline police officers following that pilot; believes that three days of training is not sufficient for officers with no previous training or experience of handling firearms, and further believes that extending the use of Tasers beyond firearms officers represents a shift in policy, not an operational decision, which requires ministerial sanction following independent evaluation and debate in the Parliament.</p>
