          <p><strong>*S1M-2373#</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Psychiatric Hospital Closures</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes where the resources from the sale of psychiatric 
            hospitals and grounds have been allocated within the overall health 
            budget; further notes the current condition of through care and community 
            care services for mental health patients, carers and professionals, 
            and believes that the current policy of the Scottish Executive of 
            not transferring capital receipts to revenue should be renewed. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2372</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Institutional Racism</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the First Minister's comments during First 
            Minister's Questions on 25 October 2001 that &quot;institutional racism 
            must be stamped out, no matter where it occurs - whether in government, 
            the police or the courts&quot; (<i>Official Report, </i>Col. 3387); 
            recognises the racism inherent in the treatment of asylum seekers 
            who have already been stigmatised and excluded, and therefore calls 
            on the Scottish Executive, as a first step, to implement this commitment 
            to stamp out racism and make immediate representations to Her Majesty's 
            Government to abolish the voucher system which shames us all. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2371</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Licensing of the Sale of Fireworks</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes with concern the public 
            safety issues surrounding the irresponsible use of fireworks; recognises 
            that this is in part due to fireworks being sold illegally to or for 
            those under 18 years old; believes that only those considered to be 
            "fit and proper persons" should be able to sell fireworks and urges 
            the Scottish Executive to consider extending the Civic Government 
            (Scotland) Act 1982 to require such persons to be licensed in order 
            to sell fireworks. </a> </p>
