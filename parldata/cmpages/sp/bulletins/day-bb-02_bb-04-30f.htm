          <p><strong>*S1M-3048</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Helping Scotland's 

            Youth Participate in Communities</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 

            notes the Scottish Executive&#146;s commitment to valuing young people 

            and reflecting their aspirations and needs; recognises the importance 

            of the Scottish Youth Summit and the follow-up launch of the consultation 

            toolkit &quot;Re:action&quot; in contributing to this agenda; agrees 

            to support constructive work with young people as they engage in civic 

            society and democratic processes whether at local level through local 

            authority youth councils, or at national level through organisations 

            such as the Scottish Youth Parliament, and welcomes work by the Executive 

            alongside other devolved administrations and UK departments to develop 

            the UK approach to the European Union white paper on youth and to 

            ensure that young people from Scotland can contribute in the wider 

            arena of international affairs.</p>

          <p>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran<strong>*</strong>, Nicol Stephen<strong>*</strong></p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3047#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Youth Disorder 

            and Support to Communities</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 

            local people in Cardonald, throughout the Glasgow Pollok constituency, 

            across Glasgow and Scotland-wide for their commitment to maintaining 

            communities which are safe and secure places to live; acknowledges 

            that the problems of youth disorder must be given a high priority 

            if the right to peace and security at home and in the community is 

            to be protected; believes that the rights of the victims of community 

            disorder must be at the centre of any initiatives on legislation to 

            tackle the problem; recognises the importance of ensuring that the 

            children's panel and justice systems are sufficiently robust to show 

            young people and their parents that there are real consequences to 

            such behaviour, and considers that the Scottish Executive and the 

            appropriate committees of the Parliament, working with local government, 

            the police, youth services and other relevant organisations, should 

            develop action to support communities.</p>

          <p><strong>*S1M-3046</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Prescription 

            Charges</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that the criteria 

            used to confer exemption from prescription charges were agreed in 

            1968; notes that since then many more conditions have been recognised 

            as lifelong and life-threatening; agrees that the state has a responsibility 

            towards those who suffer from these types of condition, and calls 

            on the Scottish Executive to carry out immediately a review of the 

            list of conditions that are exempt from prescription charges.</p>

          <p><strong>*S1M-3045</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon: Livingston Football

            Livingston Football Club on its qualification for European competition 

            in its first year in the Scottish Premier League; further congratulates 

            the directors, management, players, staff and all concerned with the 

            club for their efforts in achieving this success; and wishes Livingston 

            Football Club every success in the UEFA Cup next season.</a></p>
