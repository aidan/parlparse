            that the delegation will include representatives from key professions 
            within the local community, including a policeman, a teacher, a journalist 
            and a British Nuclear Fuels worker; welcomes the fact that professionals 
            from Ayrshire will be able to have hands-on experience and exchange 
            examples of good practice with their counterparts in Virginia; commends 
            these professionals to the people of Virginia as fine ambassadors 
            for Ayrshire and Scotland as a whole; welcomes the opportunity to 
            promote Scotland abroad and to further relations between the USA and 
            Scotland, and extends the hand of friendship to any US delegation 
            considering a possible return visit.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1077</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>NHS

            NHS Ayrshire and Arran for hosting a Health Summit on Tobacco on Wednesday 
            10 March 2004, National No Smoking Day; notes that the event brought 
            together local business organisations and policy makers to discuss 
            how best to implement no-smoking policies in the workplace and to 
            share examples of best practice; further notes that the treatment 
            of smoking-related disease costs the NHS in Scotland an estimated 
            £200 million a year, and commends the NHS board for undertaking this 
            important initiative.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1076#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>MS

            carried out by the Multiple Sclerosis Society in helping thousands 
            of people with multiple sclerosis across Scotland; welcomes MS Awareness 
            Week, 18 to 25 April 2004, as an ideal opportunity to raise awareness 
            of a condition that affects over 10,000 people in Scotland; recognises 
            that there remain serious shortcomings in treatment and support for 
            multiple sclerosis in Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should develop a national standard of care for people with multiple 
            sclerosis to ensure that levels of treatment and support are the same 
            regardless of where in Scotland they live.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1075#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Councils on Alcohol</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned about 
            Alcohol Focus Scotland's report, <em>A Report on Funding,</em> setting 
            out the financial problems faced by many of their local councils on 
            alcohol because of inadequate funding and believes that local health 
            services and local authorities should ensure that their local council 
            on alcohol is adequately funded to cope with increasing demands for 
            its services.</P>

            recognises the importance to the Gaelic community of Radio nan Gaidheal; 
            opposes the cuts imposed by the BBC on its editorial budget; condemns 
            the lack of consultation before the cuts were imposed; recognises 
            that this will threaten the livelihood of freelance Gaelic journalists 
            and put further pressure on the BBC's Gaelic staff, and therefore 
            calls on the Controller of BBC Scotland to reverse this decision which 
            is clearly detrimental to the Gaelic community.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1073</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Free 
            Postage to Gulf Soldiers</strong>-That the Parliament supports all 
            troops serving in the Gulf; notes that many friends and family&nbsp;in 
            Scotland have boosted the morale of the troops by sending parcels 
            and letters, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations 
            to Her Majesty's Government to allow small packages and letters to 
            be sent free through the British Forces Post Office to soldiers in&nbsp;the 
            Gulf&nbsp;and not to levy charges on a vital service&nbsp;at this&nbsp;time

          <p> <strong>S2M-1072#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>World 
            Water Day 2004</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the 11th World 
            Water Day on 22 March 2004 as a time to remind everyone of the importance 
            of water for our environment; acknowledges the need to focus attention 
            on the vital need to protect and conserve water resources and supplies 
            of drinking water; believes that in Scotland, the UK and worldwide 
            everyone should have access to water that is safe and affordable; 
            commends continued public ownership of water services in Scotland; 
            notes with concern the situation in Indonesia and Argentina where 
            foreign private ownership of water services has led to unreasonable 
            and excessive water costs beyond the reach of poor households, and 
            further notes with grave concern the suggestion that water may be 
            included in the General Agreement in Trade Services negotiations and 
            that this could lead to the privatisation of water services in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1071#</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Loch 
            Lomond Rescue Boat</strong>-That the Parliament warmly acknowledges 
            the work of the Loch Lomond Rescue Boat; values the service it provides 
            to local communities and visitors enjoying the delights of Loch Lomond; 
            pays tribute to the dedication of the volunteers, who all give freely 
            of their own time to run the service; recognises the importance of 
            their work in promoting and teaching all aspects of safety in and 
            around Loch Lomond, particularly for water sports; notes that a substantial 
            portion of the annual funding is raised by the efforts of volunteers, 
            and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate 
            the provision of stable funding, similar to that provided for mountain 
            rescue teams, to support this essential, life-saving service.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1070#</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> 
            <strong>Proposed Closure of Five Primary Schools in Midlothian</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that the proposed closure of five primary 
            schools in a countryside setting in Midlothian is unjustifiable on 
            educational and social grounds and that these schools are centres 
            of educational excellence and of great importance to the local communities.</P>
          <p>Supported by: David McLetchie, Bill Aitken, John Scott, Margo MacDonald<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1069#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Life 
            Expectancy in Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the recent life expectancy figures released by NHS Health Scotland; 
            believes that these figures highlight a massive divide between the 
            east and west and the more and less affluent areas of Scotland; notes 
            that life expectancy in Glasgow Shettleston constituency is the lowest 
            in Scotland at 63.9 years and that this is almost 15 years less than 
            some parts of the country and on a par with many developing countries; 
            believes that there should be a national debate on poverty and the 
            links between ill-health and low life expectancy, and further believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should make a ministerial statement about 
            how it will address this problem.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1068</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Prostate 
            Cancer Awareness Week, 22 to 28 March 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that 22 to 28 March 2004 is Prostate Cancer Awareness Week; 
            notes with concern that prostate cancer is now the most common cancer 
            in men causing around 10,000 deaths annually in the UK, and recognises 
            the important work carried out by prostate cancer support groups around 
            the country in increasing awareness of this condition.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1067</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to the University of Aberdeen on $1.85 million Gift</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the University of Aberdeen on securing 
            what is believed to be the single largest gift committed by an American 
            fund to the study of humanities within a Scottish institution; notes 
            that the $1.85 million gift will fund what is to be known as the Gluckman 
            Chair of Irish and Scottish Studies; recognises that the university's 
            Research Institute of Irish and Scottish Studies is the first of its 
            kind in the world for graduate study and research on the history, 
            language, literature and culture of Ireland and Scotland and one of 
            the largest concentrations of Scottish or Irish expertise in any European 
            university, and notes that the first holder of the new chair will 
            be Professor Tom Devine, University Research Professor in Scottish 
            history and Director of the Arts and Humanities Research Board Centre

          <p> <strong>S2M-1066</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Strip 
            Stamps on Scotch Whisky</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the 
            announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that Her Majesty's 
            Government will introduce tax stamps on sprits throughout the UK; 
            recognises that tax stamps will impact directly on the Scottish whisky 
            industry; supports the statement by the Scotch Whisky Association 
            that the introduction of tax stamps on whisky will impose financial 
            pain on legitimate businesses; believes that a tax stamp system will 
            be an ineffective means of combating fraud and illicit trade while 
            imposing substantial costs and practical problems on the industry, 
            particularly in relation to labelling and storage, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to make immediate representations to Her Majesty's

          <p> <strong>S2M-1065#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Strategic 
            Assessment of Far North Railway</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the Scottish Executive's claim to record investment in public transport; 
            notes its backing for reopening rail routes such as Stirling, Alloa 
            to Kincardine and part of the Waverley line; further notes the recent 
            Highlands and Islands Enterprise report showing that demand for the 
            rail network in the Highlands is growing and that demand could be 
            increased further by more investment in infrastructure and timetables, 
            and considers that the Executive should initiate a strategic assessment 
            of the rail service between Inverness, Thurso and Wick with particular 
            attention to the feasibility of a Dornoch Firth rail crossing to shorten 
            significantly the rail journey times on the route, taking into account 
            specific provision for the Lairg loop stations.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1064</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Blood 
            Donations in the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament encourages 
            the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to make facilities available 
            to the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) to hold 
            regular donor sessions for, specifically, MSPs and parliamentary staff; 
            notes that the new policy of not accepting blood from donors who have 
            received a blood transfusion since 1 January 1980 is likely to result 
            in a loss of around four per cent of current donations; is concerned 
            that, with secondary effects, this figure could increase to 10 per 
            cent; welcomes the new initiative by SNBTS to recruit new donors and 
            launch a new high profile media campaign later this year, and believes 
            that the Parliament is in a unique position to be able to take the 
            lead on the issue at a crucial time for securing national blood supplies.</P>

            with the position of the New Economics Foundation report, <em>Chasing 
            Progress - beyond measuring economic growth, </em>that the growth 
            and consumption represented by gross domestic product does not give 
            a true picture of quality of life and fails to deliver the Scottish 
            Executive's own sustainable development targets; recognises that economic 
            growth is not a good indicator of human progress and well-being; further 
            recognises that present rates of economic growth are leading to unacceptable 
            environmental risks, failing to guarantee social progress and do not 
            make the population any happier, and calls on the<strong> </strong>Executive<strong> 
            </strong>to introduce new social and environmental indicators such 
            as environmental footprinting and the new measure of domestic progress

            that Scottish Borders Council in its consultation document <em>Management 
            Review of the School Estate in the Scottish Borders</em>, in particular 
            the chart describing the factors that may be considered when making 
            decisions on the schools' long-term viability, did not include the 
            &quot;importance of the local school to the community&quot; which 
            had been included in the first stage evaluation; reminds the Scottish 
            Executive of its commitment in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> 
            to &quot;continued reform so that our public services are designed 
            and delivered around the needs of individuals and the community within 
            which they live&quot; and also its commitment in <em>Building our

            at the heart of the community, meeting the needs of the communities&quot;; 
            believes that the proposed closures, against the expressed wishes 
            of many communities, are driven by the requirements of proposed PPP/PFI 
            school building programmes, and therefore believes that the Executive 
            should adhere to its aforesaid commitments and reject rural school 
            closure proposals which, if they proceed, will permanently damage
