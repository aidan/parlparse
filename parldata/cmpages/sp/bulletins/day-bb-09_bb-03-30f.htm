<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3829</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Abbotsford</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Abbotsford Trust on its success in securing first round approval for a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of &pound;4.4 million; recognises the trust&rsquo;s hard work and dedication in putting together a successful bid to restore the former home of Sir Walter Scott; further recognises Abbotsford as a jewel in the Borders&rsquo; crown and its significance to Scotland&rsquo;s cultural and literary history; acknowledges the unique nature of Abbotsford due to Scott&rsquo;s involvement in its creation, design and contents, which are representative of Scott&rsquo;s intellectual and historical legacy; appreciates the significance of the successful Heritage Lottery Fund phase one application and the project&rsquo;s aim of preserving such a rich centre of Scottish history, and wishes the trust every success in the next stages of the bid process.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3828</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>10th Anniversary of Alex Salmond&rsquo;s Unpardonable Folly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 29 March 2009 marks the 10th anniversary of the election broadcast in which Alex Salmond condemned NATO&rsquo;s air strikes against Yugoslavia as an unpardonable folly; considers that Alex Salmond&rsquo;s remarks followed a decade of wars provoked by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic; recognises that NATO, in its first military action since being created in 1949, was attempting to compel Slobodan Milosevic to end his oppression of the Kosovar Albanians and to agree to a solution that would restore their autonomy and work towards full independence; also notes that Alex Salmond compared the NATO raids on Yugoslav military targets with those of the Luftwaffe&rsquo;s wartime London blitz and the bombings of Clydebank; believes that Slobodan Milosevic was relying on voices like Alex Salmond&rsquo;s to undermine international political unity opposed to the genocide in Kosovo, and further considers that the SNP continues to ignore Kosovo when it is looking for independence movements to compare itself to and that this shows that the SNP is never genuinely interested in the rights and wrongs of a foreign conflict but in its own narrow nationalist electoral agenda.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3827</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Freedom of Information and the Banking Sector</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament reaffirms its commitment to the principles of openness and transparency that underpin freedom of information legislation; believes that the public has a right to expect transparency from public organisations and from private organisations that perform public functions; regrets that, with the taxpayer holding a majority stake in two major Scottish banks, the UK Government does not allow freedom of information legislation to cover banks that have been bailed out with public funds, and therefore calls on the UK Government to amend freedom of information legislation to include nationalised banks and banks where the taxpayer holds a majority stake.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3826</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Social Networking Websites and Government Surveillance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the consideration by the Home Office of a government database to monitor the activity of law-abiding citizens on social network websites such as Facebook, Bebo and MySpace; highlights that these sites contain sensitive data on individuals that the government has no right to know; further notes recent failures by government departments in keeping confidential data secure; also notes that the police can already obtain a warrant to monitor the social networking accounts of people suspected of criminality, and believes that the UK Government should drop any plans for the blanket monitoring of all users of social networking websites.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3824</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Life Expectancy Gap Grows Under Labour</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at new figures released by the General Register Office for Scotland showing that the life expectancy gap between rich and poor people in Scotland has grown vastly since Labour came to office in 1997, with the difference for women having increased from 5.8 years between 1996 and 1998 to 6.3 years between 2007 and 2009 and the difference for men having increased from 8.6 years to 8.7 years; believes that the policies of the UK Labour Party have driven a wedge between Scotland&rsquo;s richest and poorest people, while the Scottish Government has aimed to bridge this gap with policies that make a real difference, such as freezing council tax and slashing prescription charges, and further believes that these recent figures call into question the credibility of the Labour Party&rsquo;s renewed commitment to fairness and equality.</p>

One Year On - Is life any sweeter?</em>, a follow-up report to the SCCYP&rsquo;s 2008 report, <em>Sweet 16? The Age of Leaving Care in Scotland</em>; recognises the Scottish Government&rsquo;s interest and willingness to consider the issues raised in the Sweet 16 report but expresses concern that significant further action is still required by central and local government to implement fully the original report&rsquo;s 23 recommendations; fully supports the establishment of a system of care that ensures that young people can successfully make the difficult transition from care to independent living; supports the report&rsquo;s recommendations that the Scottish Government should set a timetable for prohibiting the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for care leavers, consider adding registered social landlords to the list of those required to cooperate with local authorities in discharging their responsibilities towards children and young people, introduce a system of classification for hostels for the homeless that indicates their suitability for care leavers, consider seeking a power to order local authorities to fulfil their statutory duties and continue to monitor implementation and provide appropriate challenge to local authorities; shares the SCCYP&rsquo;s belief that, in times of financial distress, we need to make sure that children and young people are the first to receive support and that this issue must remain high on the political agenda, and therefore urges the Scottish Government and local authorities to continue to ensure that the original Sweet 16 recommendations are fully implemented as quickly as possible to ensure that all young people in care in Scotland receive the best possible information, guidance, advice and support.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3768</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>UK Government Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on all local authorities to back the Scottish Government&rsquo;s fight to put a halt to HM Government&rsquo;s proposals to slash &pound;500 million from the Scottish Budget in each of the next two financial years as, if implemented, this &pound;1 billion cut would have a hugely detrimental effect on the provision of public services to the people of Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3761.1</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>40th Anniversary of the Open University</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3761) in the name of Margaret Mitchell, insert at end &quot;, the jewel in the crown of Harold Wilson&rsquo;s Labour government, driven to fruition by the tenacity of Scots-born Labour MP Jennie Lee.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3753</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 4 February 2008, relating to the management of Career Development Loans and the Managing Information Across Partners programme, so far as these matters fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or alter the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Keith Brown</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3744.1</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Post Bank</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3744) in the name of Cathy Peattie, insert at end &quot;and further believes that the interests of the post office network would best be served by the abandonment of the UK Government&rsquo;s present plans to part-privatise the Royal Mail.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3205#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Supporting Conventional Plant Breeding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes a growing body of evidence that Scottish farmers, crofters and growers can benefit from the results of successful experiments to produce home-grown food for both animals and humans that does not rely on transgenic modification of plant material; also welcomes the recent work of the Scottish Crop Research Institute in producing highly nutritious purple-pigmented potatoes; applauds the S&aacute;rv&aacute;ri Research Trust based at Bangor University that confirms that blight-resistant S&aacute;rpo potatoes, which were successfully trialed in the Black Isle, are suitable for Scottish conditions; recalls that the Scottish Agricultural College has backed an international research collaboration on the Green Pig project, which plans to use home-grown legume varieties to reduce reliance on imported and expensive soya bean meal and so reduce costs for Scottish livestock producers; notes the scientific analysis of Dr John Fagan of Global ID Group, which shows that, although non-GM pig feed costs a bit more than GM feed because of feed-to-meat conversion efficiency, when using non-GM feed the actual cost per animal is lower, and therefore believes that a conventional plant breeding policy is an essential basis for the Scottish national food and drink policy, which itself dovetails with the conclusions of the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development that small-scale farming and ecological methods provide the way forward to avert the current world food crisis.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3000#</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Huntington&rsquo;s Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that Huntington&rsquo;s disease is a devastating, high-risk, inherited, neurological condition that causes a profound form of dementia and mental ill health; notes that the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association (SHA), based in Paisley, was established in 1989 by families living with the disease because they could not get help with health and social care services; congratulates SHA in approaching its 20th anniversary in 2009 and on providing Huntington&rsquo;s disease services staffed by skilled nurses that make a significant difference to the lives of those affected by the disease; expresses its concern that only nine out of the 15 NHS boards provide this service, and considers that all people living with the condition would benefit from access to the type of support provided by SHA.</p>
