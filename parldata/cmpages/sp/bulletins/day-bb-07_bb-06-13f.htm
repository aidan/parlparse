<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-174&diams; </strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Asylum Seeker Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, while recognising and praising the invaluable role played by projects designed to help asylum seekers take their first steps towards integration, employment and education, such as the Prince&rsquo;s Trust ShaRed Road project which has received over &pound;150,000 to strengthen the existing youth club in North Glasgow and set up a new youth club in South Glasgow, strongly condemns the continuing use of dawn raids, despite the expectation that the March 2006 agreement between the Home Office and the Scottish Executive would put an end to this traumatic practice and would ensure that the rights, needs and interests of children in asylum seeker families are given earlier and ongoing consideration; notes that many families like the Hazizi family, whose daughter is presently studying maths and physics at university and whose son is studying at the local secondary school where teachers have praised his positive contribution, still face an uncertain future with the threat of forced removal hanging over them; believes that the recent hunger strike by asylum seekers detained at Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre in South Lanarkshire over allegations of staff brutality and the way cases are handled is a result of the way in which the issue of asylum is dealt with, and recognises the importance of addressing this situation as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-173</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Carbon Offsetting</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the growing popularity of carbon offsetting among individuals and private companies; believes that actions by polluters to reduce carbon emissions elsewhere, or to mitigate the effects of climate change, can play a useful role in supplementing sound environmental policy by government; considers however that carbon offsetting cannot substitute for policies that reduce carbon emissions directly and that any role for offsetting should only be transitional; notes the widely held concerns about many commercial offsetting schemes and the difficulty in verifying the true value of most offsetting schemes; notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce carbon offsetting in respect of transport infrastructure projects, and calls on the Scottish Government, before introducing such proposals, to consider issues such as the need for rigorous independent assessments of the full direct and indirect carbon impact of each project and its associated offset, continuous updating of data for the lifetime of the infrastructure to establish any changes required to the annual offset funding, compliance with the internationally-recognised Gold Standard and the need to ensure that overall transport policy leads to direct emission reductions.</p>
<p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-172</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Choices For Life</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Choices For Life event held at the SECC in Glasgow, the ethos and aims of which are to give primary seven school children information and practical advice about drugs, alcohol, smoking, peer pressure and health as they prepare to enter secondary education; commends this programme, and congratulates the organisers for their efforts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-171</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>African Aid by Strathclyde Police and Glasgow the Caring City</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Strathclyde Police&rsquo;s donation of equipment seized from cannabis growers, under the aegis of Operation League, to the charity, Glasgow the Caring City; additionally notes the support given to poor farmers and others in central Africa by Glasgow the Caring City, and commends these bodies for their exemplary humanitarian actions and for the service they have done to the international reputations of Strathclyde and Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-164</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Dynamic Teleswitched Tariff</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that some 200,000 consumers in Scotland are affected by Scottish Power&rsquo;s dynamic teleswitched tariff which, because of its complexities of metering and billing, effectively deprives them of choice as the difficulty and cost of operating these switches deters alternative suppliers from competing for customers; further notes that some of these consumers are on fixed and low incomes and that the lack of a realistic alternative also deprives consumers of choices such as online accounts, green tariffs or capped rates, and urges Ofgem to amend condition 32 of the standard licence conditions to stipulate the range and specific type of tariffs to be made available to consumers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-163</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>EIS Call for Ban on Armed Forces Recruitment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the recent vote by the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), Scotland&rsquo;s largest teaching union, in passing a motion calling for a ban on Army recruitment campaigns in all schools.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-162#</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Car Parking Charges Review</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament broadly welcomes the outcome of the review of car parking charges by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde; expresses concern, however, that this review was only undertaken after concerted pressure from patient groups, staff and MSPs and that the review fails to recognise and admit that the previous regime was indeed unfair; shares the concern of nurses that they will still have to pay &pound;300 per year in charges, and considers that, following discussion with nursing organisations, guidelines should be issued to cap the amount that can be charged to staff.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bob Doris<strong>*</strong>, Keith Brown<strong>*</strong>, Joe FitzPatrick<strong>*</strong>, Bashir Ahmad<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-161</strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>What&rsquo;s On Your Plate? Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes NFU Scotland&rsquo;s What&rsquo;s On Your Plate? campaign which aims to highlight all the positive things delivered by Scottish farming and farmers and to persuade people to support Scottish farming by buying local food and drink; notes that the campaign asks consumers to read labels carefully and look out for Scottish produce when they are shopping; supports the call for all Scotland&rsquo;s schools to organise farm visits and backs the use of a seasonal chart to target Scottish foods when they are in season, and encourages all MSPs to visit the campaign website www.whatsonyourplate.co.uk to sign the pledge of support for Scottish food and farming.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-160</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong> <strong>Keep Scotland Beautiful Seaside Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement of Keep Scotland Beautiful&rsquo;s Seaside Awards for beaches that are clean and well-managed; welcomes the fact that a record 51 Scottish beaches have won awards this year, including seven in East Lothian; recognises, in particular, the achievements of Gullane Bents in East Lothian and St Andrews West Sands in Fife in consistently meeting the required standards since the inception of the awards in 1992; commends local authorities, residents and visitors for their contribution to raising standards over the last 15 years, and applauds the valuable role which Keep Scotland Beautiful&rsquo;s Seaside Awards programme plays in highlighting and promoting these special locations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-159</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>The Continued Detention of Aung San Suu Kyi</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the recent move on the part of the Burmese authorities to extend for a further 12 months the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma&rsquo;s National League for Democracy, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and one of only two foreign nationals to be awarded the freedom of the City of Edinburgh, who has been under house arrest for most of the last 20 years; sends Aung San Suu Kyi best wishes on her 62nd birthday on Tuesday 19 June 2007, and commends the work of Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s supporters across Scotland, including the Burma Subgroup of Amnesty International based at St Mark&rsquo;s Unitarian Church in Edinburgh, in campaigning for her immediate release and the release of others like her who have sought to secure democracy and human rights in Burma by non-violent means.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-158</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Representation in the European Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the current proposal from the Electoral Commission to reduce the number of Members of the European Parliament to be elected to represent Scotland at the 2009 European elections from seven to six; considers this to be a significant cut in Scotland&rsquo;s representation in Europe&rsquo;s legislative body, and considers that, as well as taking into account the size of the electorate, the Electoral Commission should also consider the devolution of responsibility for implementing EU legislation to Scotland&rsquo;s institutions and should therefore recommend to the UK Government that Scotland continues to elect seven Members of the European Parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-157</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Critics Awards for Theatre in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent presentation of the Critics Awards for Theatre in Scotland; congratulates all those artists and theatre groups who won awards, and particularly recognises the achievement of the National Theatre of Scotland in winning four out of 10 awards presented for its much acclaimed production, &quot;Black Watch&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-149*#*</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Food in the Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the high quality of food grown and produced in Scotland; notes the nutritional value of quality, local fresh produce and the environmental benefits of reducing transport costs; recognises the huge importance of food production to the rural economy in the south of Scotland and across Scotland; notes that it is vital for small producers to be encouraged to bid for public sector contracts; recognises the importance of effective marketing and branding in ensuring a sustainable future for Scottish producers; notes the success of Bord Bia, Ireland&rsquo;s food board; considers that Scotland should have its own similar Scottish food and drink promotion and marketing board, and believes that a Scottish Food in the Parliament event, similar to the annual Business in the Parliament event, should be held in the Parliament to showcase Scottish produce and to improve the dialogue between all sections of the food industry and the Parliament.</p>
