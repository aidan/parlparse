          <p><strong> Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2646 Mr Mark Ruskell:Contraction and Convergence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aubrey Meyer, founder of the Global Commons Institute, for formulating and establishing the contraction and convergence principle; welcomes the increasing international support for contraction and convergence as the most effective and equitable way to tackle global climate change; agrees with the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution that contraction and convergence should form the basis for global action on climate change, and calls on the Scottish Executive and the UK Government to seek, during the UK presidency of the G8, to advance the international effort to avert the dangers of climate change by promoting the constitutional framework of contraction and convergence which embodies the principle of equal rights to the global commons.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2645</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne: Congratulations to Aberdeen on Securing Scotland versus Barbarians Rugby Match</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeen Football Club on securing for the city the Scotland versus the Barbarians rugby match to be played on Tuesday 24 May 2005 and recognises, as the Scottish Rugby Union does, that, if Scotland is serious about attracting major international sporting events, then it is important to demonstrate that events such as this can be held in parts of the country outside Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2644</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Life Sciences</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the important role of life sciences in Scottish society and the contribution they make to economic prosperity, wealth creation and improving the health and quality of life of millions of people; believes that the sector harnesses Scotland&rsquo;s world-class scientific excellence and fosters greater entrepreneurial spirit; endorses the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s support to the sector, notably through successful, innovative initiatives such as the Scottish Co-investment Fund and the Life Sciences Intermediary Technology Institute; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to the Life Sciences Strategy, working in partnership with industry, academia, the investment community, NHS Scotland and all the other stakeholders to create a stable infrastructure in which the life sciences sector can flourish, and supports the firm intention to work in partnership to deliver the 15-year vision for 2020.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2643</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie: London School of Economics Study: The Identity Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings in a recent comprehensive study by the London School of Economics (LSE), <em>The Identity Project: an assessment of the UK Identity Cards Bill</em>, that involved more than 100 academics and outside experts in the fields of law, technology, information systems, government policy, business, economics and security; is concerned that the authors of the study have concluded that the proposals for an identity card and database scheme are &ldquo;too complex, technically unsafe, overly prescriptive and lack a foundation of public trust and confidence&rdquo;; further notes that the report has warned that, rather than increasing UK security, the Bill may create greater security dangers than before as well as contravene the European Convention on Human Rights and exceed current cost projections; agrees with the main conclusion of the LSE study that the current identity card legislation must be abandoned, and calls on the Scottish Executive to comply with the terms of motion S2M-2463 by giving a full statement to Parliament on the intended use of the identity database by devolved institutions.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2641</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Scotland versus Barbarians at Pittodrie, 24 May 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Rugby Union&rsquo;s decision to hold the Scotland versus Barbarians international rugby match in Aberdeen on 24 May 2005; notes that this is the first ever rugby international to be held in Aberdeen, and hopes that a home win at Pittodrie Stadium will lead to a quick return by the Scotland team to the Granite City.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2640</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Nuclear Weapons</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is opposed to the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Scotland; believes that the existing Trident nuclear system which costs almost &pound;1 billion annually to keep in operation should be scrapped; recognises that a decision on the replacement of Trident will require to be taken within the next UK Parliament; further recognises that the cost of replacing Trident would be over &pound;20 billion, and wishes to register strong opposition to any proposal by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to procure a replacement for the Trident nuclear system.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2639# Fiona Hyslop: Generation Squalor</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the publication by Shelter of <em>Generation Squalor</em>, Shelter&rsquo;s national investigation into the housing crisis, and in particular the findings that temporary accommodation constantly disrupts children&rsquo;s education, that last year 26,584 children in Scotland lived in households that applied as homeless, which is one child for every classroom, and that homeless children living in temporary accommodation on average miss out on a quarter of their schooling; notes with concern that there are many issues facing families in short-term accommodation where, in the 21st century, they have no cooker and no bed and where babies suffer physiological damage from being kept in buggies too long because of housing conditions; further notes that, although the Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 seeks to give everyone the right to a home by 2012, it will not be enough on its own to solve the housing crisis, and believes that the increased provision of affordable rented accommodation is an essential part of the solution to these problems which shame this country.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2638# Shiona Baird: OFT Failure to Protect Farmers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the Supermarkets Code compliance audit by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT); further notes the continuing control by just four supermarket chains of over 75% of the UK grocery sector and recent allegations that one of these, Tesco, caused the delay in the publication of the OFT audit; regrets that the OFT audit does not recommend the appointment of an independent ombudsman to ensure the proper enforcement of <em>The supermarkets code of practice</em>, despite its previous report finding that a &ldquo;climate of apprehension&rdquo; was preventing complaints being made by farmers for fear of being de-listed and other reprisals; expresses its concern that the situation for farmers remains bleak, with many going out of business each year due to supermarkets&rsquo; exploitative practices; notes the invitation by the OFT for further evidence to be submitted by 31 May 2005, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its influence to ensure that <em>The supermarkets code of practice</em> is extended and properly enforced throughout the entire supply chain and that farmers are adequately supported and protected to make complaints. R </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2637</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Grub Log</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments of Euan Robson, Deputy Minister for Education and Young People, on BBC Newsnight Scotland on 21 March 2005 regarding the lack of data on the impact of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s healthy eating initiative; notes the rise in children&rsquo;s obesity from 9% at P1 to 18% at P7, and therefore urges the Executive to produce and circulate an e-questionnaire to pupils in all our schools, along the lines of Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;grub log&rdquo;, as a snapshot into the actual eating habits of both primary and secondary pupils as a first step in closing the data gap. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2636</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: 1,599 Rosyth Job Losses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply saddened by the announcement of 320 further job losses at Rosyth dockyard and is seriously concerned at the resultant effect that this will have on families of dockyard workers and their communities in Fife and across Scotland; calls on all political parties and trade unions to campaign to save the jobs and also calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to end unfair and substantial government subsidies to English yards, which compete for the same MoD contract work as Rosyth; expresses concern that Rosyth dockyard&rsquo;s operators, Babcock, will not have the critical mass of skilled employees available to deliver a successful future for the dockyard; congratulates the highly-skilled Rosyth workforce for making all the changes required of it to create a more flexible and cost-effective operation, and admires its dedication, particularly in the face of losing more than half the workforce since 1997, with a total of 1,599 people having lost their job since New Labour came to power.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2635</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Council Tax Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of a Help the Aged survey regarding the plight of many of Scotland&rsquo;s pensioners which disclosed that some 70% of those responding were in council tax poverty, that the average pensioner paid 11% of net income on council tax and water rates, that accordingly the majority of pensioner households are forced to make budget cuts every year following increases in council tax and water rates and that these cuts are often made in heating, leisure, clothing and travel; notes that some 22% of those surveyed did not know that they were entitled to council tax benefit and that 40% of those entitled to claim benefit did not do so; further notes that it may be that the poorest pensioners are the very people who do not claim; notes the one-off payment of &pound;200 towards council tax and considers this to be little more than a pre-election bribe and further that it is not payable to those female pensioners under the age of 65 who are often the poorest; notes that the Scottish National Party is committed to a non-means-tested citizens&rsquo; pension to be increased in line with earnings and to a local income tax, both of which would give dignity and independence to Scotland&rsquo;s pensioners, one in five of whom live in poverty, and calls on the Scottish Executive, at the very least, to introduce a local income tax as soon as practicable and to end the abhorrent means-testing of our pensioners which is not only undignified but is failing.</p>
