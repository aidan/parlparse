            <strong>Pauline McNeill: Childhood Sexual Abuse</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the complex, devastating and long term effect of childhood 
            sexual abuse on children and adult survivors; further notes that childhood 
            sexual abuse has an immense impact on society as a whole and calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to develop and implement a national strategy 
            addressing the social, health and legal implications of sexual abuse 
            and provide central support to develop a network of agencies throughout 
            Scotland to support survivors of sexual abuse. </font></p>

            Date Stamping on Skye Bridge Concessionary Tickets</strong>-That the Parliament 
            supports the Skye against Tolls campaign and Highland Council in their 
            call for the removal of date stamping from Skye Bridge concessionary 
            tickets.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1116#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: 
            Age Discrimination in the NHS</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent 
            survey by Pat Grant, consultant at Glasgow Western Infirmary's accident 
            and emergency department, which identifies trends suggesting age discrimination 
            in accident and emergency practice; further notes last year's Age 
            Concern report <i>Turning Your Back on Us</i>, which also highlighted 
            examples of age discrimination in the treatment of elderly people 
            by the NHS, and the article by Dr Brian Williams, President of the 
            British Geriatrics Society, in the Scottish Executive's May 2000 Health 
            Bulletin, which cited evidence of age discrimination within the NHS; 
            further notes the Scottish Executive's statement that the NHSiS does 
            not discriminate against the elderly, and urges the Executive to initiate 
            an immediate independent assessment of these and other reports and 
            an immediate investigation of the alleged discriminatory practices, 
            both at a national level and in each health board area, and to make 
            these findings available to the Parliament at the earliest opportunity.</font></p>
