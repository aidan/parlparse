<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1153</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Firearms</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the increasing public concern about gun crime; agrees that action is required to give better protection to our communities by effectively banning the ownership and use of all firearms and air weapons other than for recognised and legitimate occupational and sporting interests, and supports the Scottish Government&rsquo;s intention to engage with the wide range of interests, including the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS), sporting bodies and gun lobbies, in re-energising the United Kingdom debate started in 2004, but not progressed, on reform of the existing firearms regime into a system that is simpler to understand, administer and enforce and places prime importance on public safety.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1152</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Energy Bill introduced by the UK Government; welcomes the Bill&rsquo;s provisions in relation to promotion of renewable energy which will allow the Scottish Parliament to determine levels of support for emerging technologies; recognises the potential of carbon capture and storage for reducing carbon emissions and supports further dialogue with the UK Government on exercise of powers in relation to regulation of carbon storage; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position that new nuclear power stations are not necessary to meet renewable electricity targets or carbon emissions targets and are not wanted in Scotland; welcomes the UK Government&rsquo;s recognition that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions on nuclear decommissioning should not extend to Scotland, and believes that Scotland can have a secure, low-carbon, non-nuclear energy future through a combination of a growing renewables sector exploiting a range of technologies, including marine energy, cleaner energy from fossil fuels, improved energy efficiency resulting from better insulated buildings and increased awareness of the benefits that accrue from behavioural change and demand reduction.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1151</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>New Schools and Extensions to Existing Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that in the term of office of the last administration in Scotland record numbers of new schools were built; further notes that the new Scottish Government does not have a programme for replacing old schools or adding extensions to existing schools where demand requires modification; recognises that it is vital that schools in the most deprived areas like Lochgelly, Cardenden, Benarty and Cowdenbeath be rebuilt or modernised at as early an opportunity as possible; further recognises that in schools like Donibristle Primary School where the school has the highest number of primary school pupils in Fife there is an urgent requirement to address the needs identified by parents and teachers for a new assembly hall, and hopes that the Scottish Government will announce to the Parliament without further delay, given that it has now been in office for nine months, how it proposes to finance such new developments, how it will prioritise the developments and what steps it will take next to ensure that work starts without further delay to develop a programme of new building in Fife and elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1150</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to The Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of Rev David Adams and the &nbsp;parishioners of Cowdenbeath Trinity Church in working to establish The Initiative, a project based in the Cowdenbeath and Kelty area of Fife to support younger members of the community aged 11 to 18 by delivering employment and training courses through a full-time youth worker and a &quot;transition programme&quot; for pupils making the transition from primary to secondary school; further notes that they intend to develop this provision by reaching the over 18 age group, who face challenges such as becoming single parents, bereavement, relationship or debt issues; notes that the organisers of The Initiative are working with the input of professionals to enable them to put together a feasibility study to establish the strengths and weaknesses of the current project, to develop a strategy to address these findings and, going forward, to work out how best to meet the demands and needs of their targeted beneficiaries and their vision of the future, and finally welcomes the announcement by the Big Lottery Fund that it has awarded &pound;10,000 towards this splendid work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1149</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Friends of Remploy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the eighth year of the Friends of Remploy event at the Parliament on 23 January 2007 which will pledge ongoing support and help to all those involved in creating employment and training opportunities for those with special needs and hopes that the Scottish Government will ensure that initiatives are underway to ensure that officials involved in public procurement in Scotland in both the public and private sectors will be conversant with the special powers that Article 19 of the EU Directive confers to facilitate the award of contracts to sheltered workshops, helping thereby to protect the future for this vital aspect of employment opportunity and training in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1148</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Marie Robson&rsquo;s Beautiful New Unused Home</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the case of Marie Robson of Lochgelly, a 49-year-old woman with special needs whose 75-year-old mother and 78-year-old father last spring helped to furnish and equip at the cost in excess of &pound;5,000&nbsp;the brand new purpose-built house which she has not been able to use because of the cap imposed on the social work budget by the SNP/Liberal Democrat-controlled council since last May, denying her the possibility of a care package along with another 24 urgent cases requiring care packages, and&nbsp; further notes that the council leaders have said that they will continue to put budgets before those people in greatest need.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1147</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Eastern European Slavic Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Bulgarian Association on its work towards the establishment of a Slavic cultural centre in the east of Scotland; notes that the new centre will help to promote sharing of knowledge and understanding between the people of Scotland, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Moldova; recognises the challenges that eastern Europeans face when settling in Scotland either on a temporary or permanent basis and hopes that both local and central government and the appropriate agencies will do everything possible in support; further notes that 30,000 British people have now bought property in Bulgaria and that constituents across Scotland, like Betty and Bill Miller of Dalgety Bay, stay, like many other pensioners, from March to September where their pensions enable them to enjoy a lifestyle which they treasure in the summer sunshine in a country that has so many similarities to Scotland in its geography and friendliness and opportunities for celebrating our growth in knowledge of this country, that was for too long behind the Iron Curtain, and its people; and celebrates the fact that many of the people arriving from these countries bring key skills, talents and professionalism such as Nikolai Zhelev, the honorary consul for Bulgaria in Scotland and also professor of contemporary science and medicine, with his work incorporating new developments in cancer medicine at the University of Abertay, Dundee, who is one of the driving forces behind establishing the Slavic cultural centre in the east of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1146</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Fife Council Places Elderly People in Danger</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that NHS Fife achieved its target in April 2007 of less than 20 delayed discharges over six weeks and no patients in a short stay bed, immediately prior to the change in control from a Labour-controlled Fife Council to an SNP/Liberal Democrat-controlled council but notes that, since the change of political administration, Fife has seen an upward trend in the number of delayed discharges to 164 on 15 September 2007; further notes that, according to a report from NHS Fife, the three main emerging reasons for delays in securing community care arrangements as at the September 2007 census were: non-availability of council funding for care home places, awaiting residential home places and awaiting social support to live at home; further notes that according to a survey of Fife care homes carried out in the last week, some owners of such homes report vacancies being available; recognises that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing advised that &pound;3.5 million would be made available by NHS Fife to Fife Council on a one-off basis to help with the situation but expresses grave concern that patients with urgent cases of dementia and at serious risk are being denied places in specialist homes as a consequence of SNP/Liberal Democrat Fife Council&rsquo;s decision to cut social work funding and limit finance available and considers that, as a consequence, Fife Council is failing to protect the frailest and most vulnerable people in Fife, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to act as a matter of urgency to ensure that serious danger to our elderly people in Fife is avoided.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1145&diams; </strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Maximising Migrants&rsquo; Opportunities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the contribution made by migrants from eastern Europe to the economy of the Lothians and Scotland; recognises that many are in employment that does not utilise their skills and qualifications; notes the current shortage of skills in the Scottish workforce and suggests that the Scottish Government undertakes a pilot scheme to better match the education and work experience of migrants with the skills shortages in Scotland, and further suggests that a welcome centre in Edinburgh airport could identify migrants&rsquo; qualifications and facility with the English language and provide advice on employment, training courses and other services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1144</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Midnight Footie</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Football Association, the Bank of Scotland and the Coalfield Regeneration Trust for their ongoing support of community football programmes like the Bank of Scotland Midnightleague and Bank of Scotland Soccer One; recognises that these two programmes will have benefited around 59,000 children across Scotland by the end of 2010; welcomes the extra funding from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Cashback for Communities scheme, which will see &pound;2.2 million from the proceeds of crime being used to support such activities and supplements Bank of Scotland&rsquo;s commitment to invest &pound;1.5 million over three years, and calls on MSPs of all parties to support community football initiatives in their constituencies.</p>

<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1142</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Scottish Environment Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming Scottish Environment Week which takes place from 4 to 10 February 2008 affording the opportunity to reflect on and celebrate the importance of Scotland&rsquo;s environment to our society and economy; notes that the theme of this year&rsquo;s environment week is &quot;A climate for change: enabling sustainable livelihoods&quot;, exploring how government, business and the public can inspire others and facilitate change towards sustainable development, low impact lifestyles and the carbon neutral society; pays tribute to those who have taken active steps to reduce their carbon footprint and live more environmentally sustainable lives, and further congratulates Scottish Environment LINK for organising a series of events in the Parliament and beyond exploring the opportunities and challenges involved in ensuring that Scotland&rsquo;s environment, whether urban, rural or marine, is protected and enhanced in order that it can be enjoyed by generations to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1141</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>SNP/Lib-Dems&rsquo; Shopping Charges Hit the Most Frail and Vulnerable People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the fact that the weakest and most vulnerable people in Fife have been compelled by Fife Council to face charges of &pound;7 per trip for their shopping to be done and regrets that it is the vulnerable, the voiceless and the most frail victims of Fife who are having to balance the books of the new SNP/Liberal Democrat-controlled Fife Council, against a background that on the day a budget was agreed by Fife Council early in 2006 the SNP proposed a budget of &pound;1 million less than the previous Labour administration.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1140</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Baby Ryan Turner, Nine Months Old - Victim of SNP/Scottish Liberal Democrat Policies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that nine-month-old baby Ryan Turner of Rosyth has been hospitalised for the past nine months despite being clinically assessed as being fit to go home; acknowledges that baby Ryan is at risk from hospital acquired infection and is missing the vital months for bonding and development into his family; further notes that Ryan&rsquo;s hospital care costs a minimum of &pound;1,000 per day and that the costs for NHS Fife since his birth now amount to over &pound;270,000 with case conference professionals saying that, if Fife Council does not find the family four bedroom accommodation, then baby Ryan will remain in hospital beyond next Christmas with the accruing costs amounting to a further &pound;356,000, making a total of &pound;626,000 costs and rising; expresses concern that the SNP/Scottish Liberal Democrat-controlled Fife Council is oblivious to the mounting costs to NHS Fife as a consequence of its lack of political will to source a four bedroom house and enable the Turner family to bond and share the crucial early development days of their new baby, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to take urgent action as custodian of the public purse with the consequential impact on health budgets.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1139</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Hands Off the Sick Kids</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign to save the sick kids hospital in Edinburgh; believes that the hospital provides vital healthcare and great comfort to families across Edinburgh, the Lothians, Fife and further afield; unites behind nurses, doctors, health professionals, parents and children and encourages everyone to sign the <em>Edinburgh Evening News </em>&quot;Hands Off the Sick Kids&quot; petition; agrees that, if this service was closed, local parents and children already dealing with difficult and challenging circumstances would endure significant stress and additional suffering as a result, and insists that the presumption against centralising hospital services like this is one manifesto commitment the SNP government must keep.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Patricia Ferguson<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Smith<strong>*</strong>, Elaine Smith<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong>, Trish Godman<strong>*</strong>, John Park<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>, Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1138</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Organ Donors and Presumed Consent</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commemorates the first heart transplant just 40 years ago when a team of 30 doctors and nurses, led by Dr Christiaan Barnard, Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery, gave a new heart to Louis Washkansky, a 53-year-old grocer who was suffering grave heart failure; notes that the kidneys of the dead donor, Denise Darvall, were transplanted into a black boy in another hospital; welcomes the announcement by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown MP, and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, Nicola Sturgeon, that they back the policy of &quot;presumed consent&quot;; notes that 1,000 people die every year while waiting for organs, and applauds the people of Spain where there are more organ donors per head of population than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1137</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Welcoming the Small Claims (Scotland) Amendment Order</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Small Claims (Scotland) Amendment Order 2007 (SSI 2007/496) which has the effect of now making it possible for claims of up to &pound;3,000 to be made in the small claims court; acknowledges that many campaigners across Scotland have worked for this change which reflects the reality confronted by individuals and families when they purchase goods and services such as computers, three-piece suites and holidays, and hopes that the limits will be reviewed regularly with a view to revising them to match real costs for consumers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1136</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>100 Years on, Remembering Emmeline Pankhurst</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament remembers all those who fought over the years for the right to vote and particularly remembers that 100 years ago Emmeline Pankhurst, the leading suffragette and founder of the Women&rsquo;s Social and Political Union in the battle for the right to vote, wrote powerfully on 18 February 1908 from Holloway jail giving her vivid account of the drudgery and misery, meagre rations, coarse clothing with its convicts&rsquo; arrows and her stark surroundings and notes her subsequent removal to hospital; further notes that on 10 January 1918 the House of Lords approved the Representation of the People Bill giving married women aged over 30 the vote and the US House of Representatives in Washington voted in favour of women&rsquo;s suffrage, and hopes that political parties across the country will celebrate the involvement of women in politics.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1135</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Wheelchairs - an Essential Aid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the last administration carried out a review of wheelchair services and reported to the Parliament that the service was underfunded by &pound;2.4 million and provided an extra &pound;1 million to help reduce waiting times; further notes that PAMIS (Promoting a More Inclusive Society) and the Scottish Disability Equality Forum state that the funding announcement by the Scottish Government is in fact only &pound;3 million and not the &pound;4 million given in the earlier announcement but, recognising the underfunding identified in the report to the Parliament, the government&rsquo;s announcement just puts the service where it should have been had NHS boards ensured that the service kept pace with annual uplifts; recognises that the waiting lists for wheelchair users across Scotland pose major problems for all individuals who cannot access wheelchairs particularly those of a specialist nature, and calls on the Scottish Government to monitor carefully and report on an annual basis to the Parliament whether the supply of wheelchairs is matching the needs of all requiring the use of wheelchairs.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1134#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Crime On Your Street Investigation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Glasgow <em>Evening Times</em>&rsquo; second Crime On Your Street investigation which reports on the year-on-year changes in crimes affecting Glasgow&rsquo;s communities, including highly detailed maps providing a comprehensive breakdown of the crimes committed in each of the 232 beats, and gives readers the chance to quiz Strathclyde Police&rsquo;s new Chief Constable, Steve House, on these findings; believes that such detailed reporting of each community gives a unique insight into the hugely differing crime priorities in each area, providing the police with invaluably precise information in the fight against crime in each community, and hopes that this welcome investigation will serve as a great example to be taken up by other interested parties across Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1133</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>TheyWorkForYou.com</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the value of the work done by mySociety.org, a charitable project which aims to build websites that give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives and to teach the public and voluntary sectors how to most efficiently use the internet; in particular notes the importance of website TheyWorkForYou.com, which provides accurate and up-to-date information about the work of elected politicians, enabling members of the public to identify and contact their representatives more easily and to track their work; welcomes the news that a Scottish Parliament service will be added to the site shortly, and wishes the site&rsquo;s publishers well in their efforts to raise funds for this non-profit-making venture.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1132</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Welcome Victory for Scots Literature</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the US Library of Congress&rsquo;s reversal of its decision to reclassify Scottish literature as a subsection of English literature, therefore keeping it as Scottish; notes that Scottish literature will be at the top of the table in the coming weeks as Burns Night is celebrated throughout the world, and hopes the words of Burns when he says &quot;And there&rsquo;s a hand, my trusty fiere! And gies a hand o thine! And we&rsquo;ll tak a right guid willie waught, For auld lang syne&quot; will ring true for all those celebrating his life and works.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1131.1</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>OECD Report into Scottish Education: the Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1131) in the name of Maureen Watt, insert at end &quot;further notes that the report&rsquo;s key challenge to Scottish schools is to make them work consistently well and equitably and that this outcome is dependent upon greater autonomy within school management, much greater emphasis within the curriculum on basic skills in English and mathematics and greater opportunities for pupils to follow vocational opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1131.2</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>OECD Report into Scottish Education: the Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1131) in the name of Maureen Watt, insert at end &quot;recognises the challenge in closing the gap in achievement associated with poverty and deprivation and the need for improved vocational education and high quality training; calls on the Scottish Government to take leadership and place an emphasis on literacy and numeracy, devolve power further to head teachers, develop leadership in schools and further develop vocational studies linked to high quality training, and regrets that this government has failed to address these priorities and has failed to deliver on key pledges made in the SNP manifesto.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1131.3</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>OECD Report into Scottish Education: the Quality and Equity of Schooling in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1131) in the name of Maureen Watt, insert at end &quot;welcomes the recognition of the success of educational innovations and developments in Scotland since 1999, and believes that the OECD recommendations for further development of the vocational provision of education, for the development of further leadership in school head teams and for a greater emphasis on transition into primary and between primary and secondary education, with greater devolved but more transparent funding to deliver them, should be the priorities of the Scottish Government in improving even further Scotland&rsquo;s strong internationally renowned education system.&quot;</p>
