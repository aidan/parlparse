Quinan: Batasuna Ban</STRONG>-That the Parliament regrets the decision of the 
Spanish Government to disenfranchise the voters, members and supporters of the 
Basque nationalist party Batasuna by the imposition of an undemocratic ban on 
its legitimate activities in furthering the cause of Basque independence.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3328</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Adam: The Death of Kathleen Cory</STRONG>-That the Parliament notes 
with sadness the recent death of the family tree pioneer, Kathleen Cory, while 
commemorating her magnificent contribution to the study of family history in Scotland, 
namely her ground-breaking book, <em>Tracing Your Scottish Ancestry</em>.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3327#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Karen Gillon: Attacks on Emergency Service Staff</STRONG>-That the Parliament 
condemns the mindless attacks against emergency services workers; recognises the 
vital role that fire-fighters, ambulance staff and police officers provide in 
supporting the local community and ensuring public safety, and considers that 
the Scottish Executive should take all necessary steps to ensure that the safety 
of all staff who work within the emergency services is safeguarded.</P><P>Supported 
by: Mr Michael McMahon<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Shona Robison<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Robin 
Harper<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Kate Maclean<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Johann Lamont<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

Michael Matheson<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3326</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Lloyd Quinan: MMR and TaqMan PCR Blood Test</STRONG>-That 
the Parliament recognises the recent findings of Professor John O'Leary following 
his use of the DNA blood test, Taqman PCR, which has provided further evidence 
of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism; believes that the Scottish Executive 
should provide funding to enable all autistic children to have this test on the 
NHS, and supports the family of Angus Kyle, who paid for this test privately, 
in its legal case against the manufacturers of the MMR vaccine.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3325#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mary Scanlon: Ferry Services to the Northern Isles</STRONG>-That the Parliament 
notes with concern the ongoing situation surrounding the transfer of the contract 
for ferry links to the northern isles; recognises that these services provide 
a crucial lifeline for island communities and businesses, particularly the agriculture 
and fishing industries, through a substantial volume of passenger and freight 
transport, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that ferry 
links between the mainland, Orkney and Shetland are maintained into the future.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3324</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: The Threat To Haggis, Scotland's National Dish</STRONG>-That 
the Parliament notes with concern that the Food Standards Agency has made a formal 
request to the European Commission to ban the use of sheep's intestines across 
the European Union without any acknowledgement of its unique role in Scotland's 
national dish, the haggis; further notes the lack of any scientific link between 
the possible existence of BSE in sheep and its transference to humans through 
sheep's intestine; believes that using the same weak criteria could see future 
bans extended to the offal content of haggis and that such unsubstantiated health 
scares only serve to undermine the genuine need for effective public health campaigns; 
recognises the crucial importance of haggis to Scotland's national culture, its 
popularity at home and abroad and the enjoyment it brings to so many people, and 
further believes that, given the absence of any hard evidence and the exceedingly 
low theoretical risk to public health, Scots should be free to choose how they 
like their haggis cooked and served. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3323</STRONG> <STRONG>Nicola 
Sturgeon: Glasgow Acute Services Review</STRONG>-That the Parliament notes the 
outcome of the acute services review in Glasgow; welcomes the proposed £700 million 
investment in hospital services; expresses concern about aspects of the review, 
including the proposed number and location of in-patient hospitals and the planned 
reduction of accident and emergency departments from five to two, and calls on 
the Scottish Executive to reconsider its approval of Greater Glasgow NHS Board's 
proposals.</P><P>Supported by: Ms Sandra White<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Linda Fabiani<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3322 Karen Gillon on behalf of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee: 
Commissioner for Children and Young People Bill</STRONG>-That the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">agrees 
to the proposal for a Committee Bill under Rule 9.15 contained in the 11th Report 
2002 of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, <em>Report on Proposed Commissioner 
for Children and Young People Bill</em> (SP Paper 617). </A> </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3321#

<STRONG>*S1M-3319.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Brian Adam: Aberdeen City Council Planning 
Application for a Football Stadium and Other Facilities at Kingswells</STRONG>-As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3319) in the name of Mr Mike Rumbles, leave out from 
"Aberdeen" to end and insert "that only two of the twelve Liberal Democrat councillors 
on Aberdeen City Council supported a proposal to the Scottish Executive for a 
public inquiry into a planning application for a new football stadium and other 
facilities at Kingswells; further notes with concern the conduct of one of Mr 
Mike Rumbles MSP's employees, who is a member of the council; agrees that the 
recent allegations of wrongdoing within the council have undermined the public's 
confidence in the openness and transparency of the planning process, and calls 
on the Scottish Executive to hold a public inquiry on the application as a matter 
of urgency."</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3318 Scotland vs Israel Under 21s Football Match</STRONG>

Brian Monteith: Scotland vs Israel Under 21s Football Match</STRONG>-As an amendment 
to motion (S1M-3318) in the name of Pauline McNeill, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the importance that sport plays in building 
relationships between different cultures and nations all over the world and therefore 
supports the decision of the Scottish Football Association to arrange a friendly 
fixture between the Scottish and Israeli under-21 football teams; recalls that 
Scottish teams have in the past played the Soviet Union, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, 
Argentina, East Germany and Egypt and many other teams where grounds for political 
objections existed without so much as a whimper; suggests that politicising Scottish 
sporting events could leave a Scottish-based Euro 2008 tournament open to political 
blackmail by other nations just as the 1986 Commonwealth Games was; celebrates 
the right to peaceful protest outside a sporting fixture as an integral part of 
any democracy but unreservedly condemns as undemocratic and counterproductive 
any attempts to stop a sporting event by physical or violent means, and believes 
that ultimately participation is a matter for the individual conscience of any 
sportsmen and women involved.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3316# MMR and Autism Research</STRONG>

in the name of Ms Sandra White, <A NAME="AmendmentText">leave out from &quot;pledges&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;notes with concern that the Trongate area of Glasgow has 
suffered from neglect and decline in recent years whilst other parts of the city 
have benefited from regeneration and appreciates the concerns of local traders 
in that regard; is pleased to note that Glasgow City Council has approved a five 
year regeneration plan for the area and has made budget provision for a range 
of immediate projects including public realm improvements, shop front improvements, 
shop front replacement, new street lighting and signage and a major area marketing 
programme, and considers that Glasgow MSPs should express their full support for 
the council initiative and for the development of further co-operative projects 
involving the community, businesses and local authority.&quot;</A></P><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
