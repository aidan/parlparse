    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-280#</b> <strong>Elaine Smith: UN Convention Report on the Rights of the
    Child </strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the recent publication of the second report by
    Her Majesty's Government on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; acknowledges the
    excellent work being undertaken by statutory and voluntary bodies at national and local
    level in upholding the Convention, including &#145;Parents Action for Safe Play
    Kirkshaws&#146;, an example of good practice in the constituency of Coatbridge and
    Chryston; affirms its support for the convention, and commits itself to working to ensure
    that it is fully implemented in Scotland. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-279</b> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Crichton University</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes and welcomes the excellent initiatives taken by all partners in the
    development of the Crichton University campus in Dumfries, in particular the collaboration
    between educational institutions, and urges the Scottish Executive to investigate this
    site and model of delivery as a basis for the development of a University of the South of
    Scotland.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-278</b> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: Scottish Beef Export to France</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the lack of success of Her Majesty's Government in returning UK beef
    to the French market; further notes the distinctiveness of Scotland&#146;s high quality
    beef products and that Scotland&#146;s BSE record is much lower than that of the UK as a
    whole, and, given that agriculture is a devolved matter, calls upon the Minister for Rural
    Affairs to take the case for Scotch Beef direct to the French Government to ensure that
    the ban on Scotch Beef is lifted as soon as possible as opposed to Scotland&#146;s case
    being dragged down by the UK case as ineffectually put forward by Her Majesty's
    Government.</p>

    Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Mr John Swinney<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-277</b> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Chechnya</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    notes representations made by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs
    to the Russian Foreign Minister about the situation in Chechnya; expresses deep concern
    over the Russian military offensive which continues to have devastating effects upon
    civilian life and property; salutes the work of agencies working in this area to promote
    respect for humanitarian principles, and calls upon the international community to take
    action to alleviate the plight of refugees and to ensure respect for democracy and human
    rights in Chechnya.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-276</b> <strong>Michael Russell: BBC Resources and BBC Worldwide</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with concern the proposals contained in the Davies report regarding
    BBC Resources and BBC Worldwide, believing that any threat to BBC Resources in Scotland
    will have a detrimental effect on the BBC in Scotland and on the Scottish independent
    sector and will inevitably be detrimental to training provision for the production
    industries, lead to job losses and affect the ability to be a public service broadcaster
    capable of responding in a national emergency; further notes that the sale of BBC
    Resources and BBC Worldwide will also have little positive impact on the financing of the
    BBC and, in the case of BBC Worldwide, may actually reduce the income available to the
    BBC; supports the devolution of broadcasting powers, but in the meantime urges Her
    Majesty's Government to reject the Davies report and take no steps to sell off such
    important parts of the broadcasting infrastructure.<b><i> R</i></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-275#</b> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Pollokshaws Sports Centre</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the importance of accessible sport and leisure facilities in
    communities around Scotland; notes with regret the decision of Glasgow City Council to
    close the well-used Pollokshaws Sports Centre and urges reversal of that decision, and
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to highlight the positive role that community sports
    facilities can play in combating social exclusion and improving the lives of people in our
    most deprived communities.</p>

    Sandra White<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-274</b> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Investigation Into Water Charges</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament, in the light of the proposed significant increases in water charges
    particularly in the North of Scotland Water Authority area, calls upon the Transport and
    Environment Committee to investigate urgently these increases, the Scottish
    Executive&#146;s response and the implications of the new regulatory regime for customers.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-273#</b> <strong>Andrew Wilson: Cumbernauld School Closures</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament condemns the sham consultation process by North Lanarkshire council over
    the proposed closure of schools in Cumbernauld and calls upon Councillor Charles Gray,
    North Lanarkshire Education Convenor, to take full account of parents&#146; wishes and not
    dismiss them out of hand.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-272#</b> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Credit Union</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament recognises the benefits brought to many communities such as Airdrie and Shotts
    by credit unions including access to low cost credit to families who would otherwise have
    to borrow from high interest loan sharks, encouraging a saving ethos and empowering
    communities to address their own problems, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring
    forward measures to establish and implement a credit union development strategy for
    Scotland that will ensure a consistent level of support throughout Scotland.</p>
