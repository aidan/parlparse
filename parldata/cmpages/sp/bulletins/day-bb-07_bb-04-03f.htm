<p align="justify"><strong>*S2M-5803</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Ending Tax Breaks for Ministers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the existence of a tax break which allows Scottish Executive and Westminster ministers to not pay tax on the provision of government cars; notes that all other taxpayers, including MSPs and MPs, have to pay substantial sums in tax, and calls for the Scottish Executive to demand that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government ends this unjustifiable tax perk.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5802</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>Kerelaw Residential School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the ongoing situation in relation to Kerelaw Residential School in North Ayrshire; recognises the devastating effect that allegations and subsequent investigations and suspensions can have on individuals and their families; believes that a public enquiry should be held to determine exactly what happened at the school, and expresses concern over the conviction of ex-Kerelaw worker, John Muldoon.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5801</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Thanks to Parliament Staff</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to join the Scottish Socialist Party parliamentary team in conveying sincere thanks to the people in the Parliament who work to make each of our lives easier: cleaners, catering staff, porters, security staff and police, mailroom staff, maintenance staff and all parliamentary workers, who remain courteous, friendly and hard-working.</p>

<p align="justify"> <strong>S2M-5800</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Fears Over Retention of DNA from Innocent People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the permanent retention of DNA from innocent people is something which was debated and rejected through proper parliamentary procedures and that such parliamentary decisions should be respected; expresses regret that Scottish Labour&rsquo;s election manifesto will call for this measure to be introduced even though there is no evidence that the retention of innocent people&rsquo;s DNA is effective in solving crime, and calls on the Scottish Executive to uphold the wishes of the Parliament while looking at more effective means of tackling crime.</p>
<p align="justify">Supported by: Chris Ballance, Carolyn Leckie, Eleanor Scott, Tommy Sheridan, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Ms Maureen Watt, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> <strong>S2M-5799</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Monklands General Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &pound;300 million investment planned by NHS Lanarkshire; further welcomes the planned Maggie&rsquo;s Centre, cancer service and the 24-hour community casualty unit at Monklands General Hospital, however condemns the decision by NHS Lanarkshire, ratified by the Scottish Executive, to downgrade the hospital; believes that health service reconfiguration decisions should be based on the health and social needs of the people of Lanarkshire, weighted for the impact on reducing social and health inequalities, and not narrow financial considerations; further believes that the financial information provided to the NHS board as a basis for its decision was flawed; notes that Elaine Smith MSP has referred the matter of the finances to the Auditor General for Scotland and is awaiting an outcome; further notes that the decision was reached after a flawed consultation which was launched with a preferred option to downgrade Monklands and which dismissed the 50,000 signatures collected by Karen Whitefield, Cathie Craigie and Elaine Smith MSPs, ignored the articulate comments made at public meetings and did not reflect the content of the many comprehensive submissions made; finds it incredible that NHS Lanarkshire has decided to downgrade its busiest, most efficient and effective accident and emergency department, located in the area serving over half the population of Lanarkshire and suffering from some of the poorest health in Scotland alongside high levels of poverty and deprivation; notes that Wishaw and Hairmyres hospitals close to accident and emergency admissions much more frequently than Monklands; believes that a reduction in capacity by downgrading Monklands can only exacerbate that situation and increase the pressure on neighbouring hospitals, and believes that this decision to downgrade Monklands should be reversed.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5640</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Recognition of RMT Strike - Recognition of Workplace Agreements</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 70% vote in favour of strike action by signaller members of the RMT union; considers that the breakdown in industrial relations centres on the failure of Network Rail to honour the spirit and intention of the signallers&rsquo; 35 hour week agreement and that management have abused the rostering agreements and have continued carrying out Cognisco testing in signal boxes, despite a commitment not to do so; recognises that throughout this situation the union and its members have been, and continue to be, available to talk to the management to resolve these issues; believes that RMT members should not be forced to resort to such action and that Network Rail should enter into meaningful negotiations concerning all the many issues at the heart of this dispute and seek to reach agreement with the RMT, and calls on all elected members to exert the strongest pressure on Network Rail to talk to the RMT and to resolve this dispute by honouring the spirit and intention of all workplace agreements with the signallers.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5583</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Disband the SBCCU</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the establishment of the Special Branch Community Contact Unit (SBCCU) by Tayside Police in that its actions appear focussed on monitoring anti-war, Palestinian rights and Muslim groups within Dundee&rsquo;s further education institutions; also notes that members of the SBCCU attended the University of Dundee Freshers&rsquo; Fair, did not identify themselves as police officers and proceeded to question students staffing the Stop the War stall about their plans for future activities and views on the situation in the Middle East; further notes with concern the SBCCU&rsquo;s practice of sitting in on meetings of the Islamic Society within the University of Dundee; expresses concern that information collected by Tayside SBCCU may also be passed overseas, including to countries with poor human rights records, a particular concern as a university like Dundee attracts a large number of overseas students; believes that such actions put Muslim groups under suspicion and are extremely unhelpful in the current Islamophobic climate and that such action by the police engenders fear in students, discourages them from participating in political activities, stifles debate and undermines the very principle of academic freedom within universities and colleges; further believes that it should not be the role of Special Branch officers to monitor the political activities of student groups on university and college campuses; congratulates the representatives of the University and College Union who have joined students in publicly voicing their concerns about the unit in Dundee; calls on Tayside Police to radically rethink its strategy for community bridge-building and the role of Special Branch in it, and calls for the disbandment of the SBCCU.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5565</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with Lieutenant Ehren Watada</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the courageous stance of First Lieutenant Ehren Watada who on 22 June 2006 became the US Army&rsquo;s first commissioned officer to publicly refuse deployment to Iraq; notes that Lieutenant Watada, who appeared before a court martial on 5 February 2007, faces up to six years imprisonment for refusing to deploy to Iraq and for speaking out against a war that he believes is illegal, stating on the day he announced his decision &quot;As the order to take part in an illegal act is ultimately unlawful as well, I must refuse that order&quot;; further notes and applauds the following words spoken by Ehren Watada when he addressed the Veterans for Peace National Convention in America last year &quot;I stand before you today, not as an expert, not as one who pretends to have all the answers. I am simply an American and a servant of the American people. My humble opinions today are just that. I realise that you may not agree with everything I have to say. However, I did not choose to be a leader for popularity. I did it to serve and make better the soldiers of this country. And I swore to carry out this charge honourably under the rule of law. To stop an illegal and unjust war, soldiers can choose to stop fighting it. It became instrumental in ending the Vietnam war, but it has been long since forgotten. Now it is not an easy task for the soldier. For they must be aware that they are being used for ill gain. They must hold themselves responsible for individual action. They must remember that duty to the constitution and the people supersedes the ideologies of their leadership. The soldier must be willing to face ostracism by their peers, worry over the survival of their families and, of course, the loss of personal freedom. They must know that resisting an authoritarian government at home is equally important to fighting a foreign aggressor on the battlefield. Finally, those wearing the uniform must know beyond any doubt that, by refusing immoral and illegal orders, they will be supported by the people not with mere words but by action. Awareness of the history of atrocities and destruction committed in the name of America &ndash; either through direct military intervention or by proxy war &ndash; is crucial. They must realise that this is a war not out of self defence but by choice for profit and imperialistic domination. They must know that neither Congress nor this administration has the authority to violate the prohibition against pre-emptive war &ndash; an American law that still stands today. Though the American soldier wants to do right, the illegitimacy of the occupation itself, the policies of the administration and rules of engagement of desperate field commanders will ultimately force them to be a party of war crimes. The Nuremberg Trials showed America and the world that citizenry as well as soldiers have the unrelinquishable obligation to refuse complicity in war crimes perpetrated by their government. Widespread torture and inhumane treatment of detainees is a war crime. A war of aggression born through an unofficial policy of prevention is a crime against the peace. An occupation violating the very essence of international humanitarian law and sovereignty is a crime against humanity. These crimes are funded by our tax dollars. Should citizens choose to remain silent through self-imposed ignorance or choice, it makes them as culpable as a soldier in these crimes. I have broken no law but the code of silence and unquestioning loyalty. If I am guilty of any crime, it is that I learned too much and cared too deeply for the meaningless loss of my fellow soldiers and my fellow human beings. If I am to be punished, it should be for following the rule of law over the immoral orders of one man. If I am to be punished it should be for not acting sooner. Martin Luther King Jr once said &quot;History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.&quot; The time to fight back is now &ndash; the time to stand up and be counted is today&quot;; notes that Watada ended with another quote from Martin Luther King, &quot;One who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is, in reality, expressing the highest respect for the law&quot;; agrees to send a message of solidarity to Lieutenant Ehren Watada, and encourages Members and parliament staff to sign the on-line petition at: http://gao.org/ltwatada/join.html.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5542</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Equal Treatment for Expatriate Pensioners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/712), laid before the Westminster Parliament in March 2006, excluded expatriate pensioners living in countries not covered by reciprocal social security arrangements with the United Kingdom from having their state pensions up-rated in the same way as those living in the UK; further notes that the cost of including these pensioners in the annual up-rating order for 2005-06 would have been just &pound;20 million; condemns this penny-pinching approach to pensioners who have paid many years of national insurance contributions before emigrating, and calls on the Westminster Government to restore these pensioners&rsquo; right to equal treatment with pensioners resident in the UK.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5485</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Keep the Sercos Out, Amend the PMS Act</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the terms of the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 (PMS Act) which enable a company limited by shares to be contracted to provide general medical services only on condition that one share is owned by a medical practitioner; but recognises that this has led to GP services being prey to companies like Serco, recognises that the legislation only states that NHS boards may enter into a contract with such a company, that open tendering to non-GPs is not a requirement and that NHS Lanarkshire could have fulfilled primary medical provision in Harthill by contracting directly with a GP or a partnership; believes that NHS Lanarkshire, which has revealed that one current and one former medical director work for Serco, has deliberately created an opportunity for expansion for Serco, but in any case considers that the current legislation places companies limited by shares in a more advantageous and less regulated position than single GPs or partnerships, and calls on the Scottish Executive to state clearly to NHS boards that they need not openly tender in the manner of NHS Lanarkshire and to amend the PMS Act to ensure that no such situation is allowed to occur in the future.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5480</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>SEERAD Animal Gatherings Order</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, if the Animal Gathering Order is introduced as proposed, it will introduce a licensing system under which event organisers would have to ensure a livestock standstill of 27 days before and 27 days after any show; further notes that it would require disinfectant facilities to be installed at every showground to clean and disinfect clothing and footwear that comes into contact with animal waste or mud and that it would also mean that all vehicles would need to be disinfected when entering and exiting show fields; believes that this will threaten the continuation of a great many livestock events across Scotland, events which are vital in maintaining the link between farmers, local communities and the general public; further notes that livestock bio-security problems rarely come from members of the public, but are instead almost always imported from other countries with poor bio-security and traceability systems, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to withdraw the order.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5445</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>James Watt College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is very concerned about the current situation at James Watt College, where debts are reported to be around &pound;6 million and the threat of redundancy hangs over many valuable members of staff; considers that the current situation is a result of decisions taken by the former college principal, Mr Bill Wardle, and the board of management; believes, therefore, that a payment of around &pound;130,000 to Mr Wardle is inappropriate and can only be seen as a reward for failure; further considers that current proposals to address the problems at the college, including reducing teaching staff costs, would equate to staff being punished for the failure of management; recognises that such proposals would ultimately lead to redundancies, an increased workload for the staff that remain and a diminution of the quality of education provided to students, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that sufficient funding and support is provided to James Watt College to ensure that there are no compulsory redundancies among staff and that students are not adversely affected by the failures visited on the college by the former principal and the board of management.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5439</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Protect the Use of Xolair for Asthma Sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) not to recommend the use of Xolair for people with severe allergic asthma; notes that, for 90% of people with asthma, their asthma symptoms should be controllable if they are on the right levels of existing asthma drugs but, for those who have difficult-to-control asthma and continue to experience poor quality of life and continuous symptoms, Xolair is the only treatment that may be able to reduce the impact of asthma on their lives by reducing symptoms and hospitalisation; notes that Xolair has been shown to reduce emergency admissions to hospital, reduce asthma exacerbations, improve lung function and improve quality of life, and urges the SMC to reconsider its decision not to recommend Xolair in Scotland, a drug which has been described by Donna Covey, Chief Executive of Asthma UK, as &quot;the only hope that some people in Scotland currently have.&quot;</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5401</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Hospitals Need More Capacity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that Wishaw General Hospital was forced to close to accident and emergency admissions due to lack of capacity and that neighbouring hospitals were placed under increased pressure; notes that other NHS board areas are also at full capacity, often causing long waits on trolleys and multiple transfers between departments for some patients; believes that, with an increasing elderly, dependent and sick population, NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s plans to close emergency services and acute admissions at Monklands Hospital are inherently flawed, when experience demonstrates that an increase in capacity is needed, not a decrease; further believes that the burden of servicing two major PFI projects at a cost of &pound;42.7 million in 2006-07, the second biggest spend on PFI in Scotland, compromises NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s ability to organise services in the interests of patients and communities, and considers that the lack of capacity is compromising quality of care for patients and that a proper needs assessment of capacity and the resources to deliver that capacity is urgently required.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5367</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>My Money is as Good as Yours</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing number of establishments in England that are refusing to accept Scottish banknotes, viewing this form of discrimination as something which calls into question the benefits Scotland receives from being part of the United Kingdom; expresses continuing bemusement that Scottish banknotes are not legal tender in either Scotland or the rest of the UK, while the only legal tender are coins from the Royal Mint and some of these are subject to limitations, for example &pound;1 worth of 1p coins is legal tender but &pound;1.01 is not and &pound;1 and &pound;2 coins are legal tender in Scotland to an unlimited amount; notes that all money, whether printed in Glasgow or London, is subject to the same requirement to carrying a promise to pay the bearer the value of the note, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland to change Schedule 5, Part II, A1 of the Scotland Act 1998, which states that the issue and circulation of money is a reserved matter and therefore that the Scottish Parliament has no powers to alter the legal position of Scottish banknotes, thus ending this queer and somewhat confusing situation.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5321</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulation to Nuclear Free Local Authorities on Vote to Abolish Nuclear Weapons</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Nuclear Free Local Authorities on its annual general meeting vote to call for the abolition of UK nuclear weapons and the redirection of resources to support the development of public services and tackle climate change that was passed unanimously on 7 December 2006; notes that the resolution agreed with the report of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission,<em> Weapons of Terror</em>, which stated that &quot;Nuclear, biological and chemical arms are the most inhumane of all weapons. Designed to terrify as well as destroy, they can, in the hands of either states or non-state actors, cause destruction on a vastly greater scale than any conventional weapons, and their impact is far more indiscriminate and long-lasting. So long as any state has such weapons - especially nuclear arms - others will want them. So long as any such weapons remain in any state&rsquo;s arsenal, there is a high risk that they will one day be used, by design or accident. Any such use would be catastrophic&quot;; agrees with the report&rsquo;s statement that &quot;Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations and non government actors should commence preparations for a World Summit on disarmament, non-proliferation and terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction to generate new momentum for concerted international action&quot;, and therefore supports Nuclear Free Local Authorities&rsquo; call for the Westminster Government to (a) give support to a world summit, (b) signal its resolve to strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation regime by terminating any further work on a replacement for Trident and (c) announce an early date to withdraw the Trident fleet from active service and shares its support for all lawful campaign action in the United Kingdom to secure support for no Trident replacement and its support for the work of international Mayors for Peace and endorses its 2020 Vision campaign that calls for international agreement by 2010 on a nuclear weapons convention to dismantle nuclear weapons by 2020.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5272</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Victory for Militant Trade Union Action at Glasgow City Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates UNISON members in Glasgow City Council for the substantial victory they have achieved after the council caved in on the eve of a planned three-day strike which would have been the biggest conflict it faced with trade unionists in several years; notes that the negotiated agreement means that the union has won a settlement that amounts to indefinite or lifetime protection of current salaries, that is that either people will be retrained or their jobs will be redesigned to guarantee them their current pay by March 2009 or that deadline will be extended indefinitely until such time as these devices kick in; recognises that the Culture and Leisure Services Department is still threatened by a proposal that it will be hived off to a charitable trust which would mean only one year&rsquo;s protection under TUPE rules, and further notes that women underpaid for decades have still not achieved full compensation to the value of potential equal pay claims but, in so doing, recognises that this victory strengthens the trade union and its members and will enable them to organise and achieve fair and equal terms and conditions in the future.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5270</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Meter Relief</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Scottish Gas to end the practice of back charging token prepayment meter customers; notes that only three of the six main suppliers, Scottish Power, npower and Powergen, continue a practice which forces low income consumers into debt as a result of these suppliers&rsquo; failure to reset meters after a price rise, and calls on these companies to follow Scottish Gas by announcing an immediate end to back charging.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5267</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Funders&rsquo; Forum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the first Scotland Funders&rsquo; Forum conference; congratulates its members, which include lottery distributors, independent grant-making trusts, Scottish Executive departments and COSLA, on the development of a common evaluation framework, to be unveiled at the conference, which aims to improve consistency and provide an effective approach to evaluation and learning by funders; recognises the importance of collaboration among funders to reduce bureaucracy by lessening the burden on voluntary organisations of repeated and differing requests from each of their funders for information, in different forms and on different dates, by replacing these with a more coherent, focussed and uniform system of scrutiny and reporting, agreed by funding and recipient organisations, to work towards continuous improvement and to increase the capacity of funders and applicants to achieve measurable progress; supports the Scotland Funders&rsquo; Forum in its efforts to improve the appetite for taking managed risks to meet unmet need and to look ahead to opportunities to broker new and different approaches to providing services for communities, and commends the forum for its commitment to achieving improved outcomes for communities in Scotland.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5265</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>North East Scotland Credit Union Farepak Offer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates North East Scotland Credit Union (NESCU) on its announcement that is willing to provide low-cost loans to everyone in Grampian who has lost money with Farepak; notes that, as with every loan it issues, NESCU will provide free life insurance to cover the loan and that it will waive its usual joining fee, required of all credit union customers, in the case of Farepak families; believes that this is a generous gesture which demonstrates the important role that credit unions can play in helping families affected by events like the Farepak collapse; urges families throughout Grampian and Scotland which have lost money with Farepak to use credit unions rather than alternative forms of moneylending, and hopes that credit unions throughout Scotland will follow NESCU&rsquo;s lead and offer assistance to families affected by Farepak&rsquo;s collapse.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5259</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>End of Term Report on Multiple Sclerosis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the <em>End of Term Report on Multiple Sclerosis, </em>published by the Multiple Sclerosis Society; notes with concern that, with around 10,400 people diagnosed, Scotland has the highest prevalence of MS in the world; appreciates that, while some improvements have been made to the care and treatment of MS with drugs such as beta interferon and glatiramer now being generally available on the NHS, much more still needs to be done; is concerned at the slow progress of the development and implementation of standards of care for people affected by neurological conditions, a proposal for which was approved on 2 February 2006; is further concerned that, although there are now 23 MS nurses in Scotland, they have required to be jointly funded by charitable donations rather than through central funding and that there is still considerable inequality of access to such nurses with Lanarkshire, for example, having only one nurse for 1,100 patients; is deeply concerned that the social care framework for people with MS is severely limited due to local authority budget constraints, with services such as respite care not being adequately and appropriately delivered in some areas and the Multiple Sclerosis Society being required to pick up the shortfall to the tune of &pound;700,000 annually, and home adaptations not being available free of charge to patients in all local authority areas, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide adequate resources to the NHS and local authorities to ensure equal access to care and services to all MS patients, regardless of where they live.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>S2M-5114</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh - Showing the Way to a Low Carbon Future?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of a report on decentralised energy, commissioned by the City of Edinburgh Council, Greenpeace UK and WWF Scotland, suggesting that Edinburgh could become a world leader in the fight against climate change; notes the findings of the report that if Edinburgh implements its recommendations to opt for a decentralised energy system, using micro-renewable energy generation and combined heat and power (CHP), it could meet all of its energy needs, slash carbon dioxide emissions and save money, without the use of new nuclear power; contrasts the decentralised model with the present system used in the United Kingdom, whereby the vast majority of electricity comes from large, centralised and grossly inefficient thermal power stations that waste around two-thirds of their energy inputs; believes that, as long as fossil fuels are used to generate electricity, both generators and consumers of energy have a responsibility to ensure that this finite and polluting energy is used as efficiently as possible; acknowledges that decentralised energy is a tried and tested system which is already widely used across many parts of Europe, where combined heat and power networks are commonplace, and calls for other cities across Scotland and the rest of the UK to follow this example and to adopt a decentralised energy system fit for the 21st century.</p>
