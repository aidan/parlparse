<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#9;<strong>S3M-5231</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Schools (Consultation) (Scotland) Bill, debate on the group of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
  <p>Group 1:&#9;35 minutes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Tackling Clostridium difficile&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-5221</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Tackling Clostridium difficile</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends all NHS staff for their efforts in the fight against Clostridium difficile; recognises that significant challenges remain in reducing the number of deaths from Clostridium difficile in all NHS board areas; calls on the Scottish Government to establish a more robust inspection regime that provides for an immediate inspection of any hospital at which there is an ongoing outbreak to provide advice and ensure that guidelines are properly followed; considers that the inspectors should have the power to close wards, or any other part of the NHS estate, that might contribute to the spread of infection; regrets the delay by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing in making matters public following the outbreak at Ninewells Hospital<font color="#0000ff">;</font> believes that patients, relatives and the public have a key role to play in preventing the spread of Clostridium difficile, and further believes that there should be a single website, updated in real time, showing the performance of every hospital in Scotland and guidance provided to NHS boards on reporting outbreaks immediately. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5221.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Tackling Clostridium difficile</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5221) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;agrees that tackling Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) must continue to be a top priority for the Scottish Government; notes the range of actions that are now in place to drive down infections, backed by an investment in excess of &pound;50 million; welcomes the establishment of an independent Healthcare Environment Inspectorate that has begun its programme of announced and unannounced visits to all acute hospitals over the next three years; acknowledges that the establishment of a public inquiry into the events at the Vale of Leven Hospital last year will ensure that any additional actions are identified to help prevent such a tragedy happening again; further acknowledges that the HAI Taskforce has fully considered the Labour Party 15-point action plan and has agreed to further consider those measures not already included in its current three-year work programme; recognises the progress that has been made on a national staff uniform for NHS Scotland; further notes that the Scottish Government has agreed to pilot approaches to electronic bed management and tracking infections and will fully evaluate these pilots and take whatever action is appropriate, and further notes that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing will continue to ensure that systems and processes for the notification and management of outbreaks are improved in light of experience.&quot; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-5221.1.1</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> Tackling Clostridium difficile&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-5221.1) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to review the remit of the public inquiry currently being conducted by Lord MacLean so as to require that inquiry to consider the circumstances of other cases of Clostridium difficile in hospitals across Scotland to verify that the measures taken by the Scottish Government are sufficient to meet the needs of all Scottish hospitals.&quot;</p>
