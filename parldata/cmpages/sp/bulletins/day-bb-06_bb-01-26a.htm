<p align="center"><strong>Section A &ndash; Today&rsquo;s Business</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em><em>followed by</em></em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: The Economy of the East of Scotland&mdash; </p>
<p><strong>S2M-3863</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>The Economy of the East of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament opposes the dramatic increase in tolls on the Forth Road Bridge being proposed by the Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA); notes that the proposals flow directly from the powers to implement road user charging granted under the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 which were opposed by the Conservatives and supported by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party; further notes with concern the view of FETA that the bridge could be closed to heavy goods vehicles by 2013 and to all traffic by 2019; believes that either of these scenarios would have extremely serious consequences for the economy of the east of Scotland; supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s decision to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the structure of the current bridge; further believes, however, that in light of the timescales involved, this must be conducted simultaneously with preliminary work on options for a new crossing and how this might be funded, and calls on the Executive to commence such work without delay. </p>
<p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3863.2</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: The Economy of the East of Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3863) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the record of successive Conservative governments in approving tolling regimes on bridges, and further notes that the Scottish Government believes that a Forth road crossing is essential for the Fife economy and that it will make its decision on the FETA toll application after examination of the condition of the current bridge and the need for any replacement.&quot; </p>
<p> <strong>S2M-3863.1</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: The Economy of the East of Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3863) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;opposes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes with regret the announcement by Lexmark that it intends to close its factory in Rosyth with the loss of 700 jobs; expresses sympathy for the workers affected; is concerned about the impact the closure will have on the economy of Dunfermline and West Fife; believes that, in response to the closure, an action plan targeted at assisting the Lexmark workforce should be introduced immediately; further believes that the Scottish Executive, in conjunction with Fife Council, should put in place, as a matter of urgency, a strategy for the economic revitalisation of Dunfermline town centre and that Transport Scotland should be directed to improve the transport links to the area in order to make it more attractive for investors; agrees that, as part of a package to help the economy of Fife, an immediate announcement freezing the level of tolls on the Forth Road Bridge at &pound;1 should be made, and further agrees that planning for a new crossing should begin immediately in view of the fact that the bridge will close to heavy goods vehicles in 2013 and to all traffic in 2019 if a satisfactory engineering solution cannot be found to overcome the bridge&rsquo;s structural problems.&quot; </p>
<p><em><em>followed by</em>&#9;</em>Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Future Energy Policy&mdash; </p>
<p><strong>S2M-3870</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Future Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with interest the UK Energy Review; believes that provision of a secure and affordable supply of electricity is essential to Scotland&rsquo;s future prosperity, and therefore believes that all options, including the construction of new nuclear power stations to replace existing nuclear capacity, should be considered for inclusion in Scotland&rsquo;s future energy mix. </p>
<p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3870.4</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson: Future Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3870) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the development of a wide range of renewable energy technologies in Scotland as a key element of a balanced energy supply mix; supports the Executive&rsquo;s target that 40% of electricity generated in Scotland by 2020 should come from renewable sources; looks forward to publication of the revised Scottish Climate Change Programme and the consideration given to the contribution of energy efficiency and renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions; endorses the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to tackling fuel poverty; acknowledges the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to not support further development of nuclear power stations while waste management issues remain unresolved; welcomes the forthcoming release of the first two volumes of the Scottish Energy Study; recognises the importance of the UK energy review, and supports the Executive&rsquo;s engagement with the UK Government, Ofgem and the energy industry to ensure that the future energy supply needs of Scotland are met.&quot; </p>
<p> <strong>S2M-3870.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Future Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3870) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &quot;with interest&quot; to end and insert &quot;that Scotland is an energy rich nation; rejects calls for investment in new nuclear power stations in favour of accelerating the development of our renewables potential and emerging clean technologies; notes that, contrary to the impression given by many commentators, Scotland is a gas exporter and consumes only one-eighth of gas produced, and believes that the Parliament requires the political powers to determine our own energy future and ensure that our energy resources benefit the people of Scotland.&quot; </p>
