<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4394</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>24 Hour Noise Helpline for Ayrshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates East, North and South Ayrshire councils on the launch of the 24-hour noise helpline, made possible by funding from the Scottish Executive, for residents of Ayrshire who experience noise disorder.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4393</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Evening Express &quot;Protect our Kids&quot; Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>Aberdeen Evening Express</em> on its &quot;Protect Our Kids&quot; campaign which aims to raise awareness of the importance of care being taken when parking around schools; recognises the potential consequences of careless driving and parking near schools, and urges the Scottish Executive to take action to encourage increased use of walking buses and accessible school transport to reduce the number of children being driven to school, promoting road safety especially near schools, reducing traffic congestion and improving the environment.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4392</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Senior Citizens&rsquo; Rebate for Water and Sewerage Rates</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to review the practice of charging senior citizens, who are in receipt of full pension credit, for water and sewerage rates; notes that water and sewerage rates are currently 5.2% of the full state pension, and considers it sensible to exempt pensioners from paying for water and sewerage rates if they are in receipt of council tax benefit.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4391</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Baird Memorial Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils and the teaching, domestic and janitorial staff at Baird Memorial Primary School in Condorrat, Cumbernauld, for working as a team to achieve an Eco Schools&rsquo; flag award; recognises the hard work and dedication shown by all those involved and particularly welcomes the fact that pupils are putting their new-found knowledge and skills into practice by living more eco-friendly lifestyles, and further recognises their excellent achievement in gaining Charter Mark status, a worthy recognition for the entire school community.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4390</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Increased Support for Home Renewables Needed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing freeze on grant funding by the Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative (SCHRI); recognises that the continuing delay will inevitably have a negative effect on many Scottish companies registered to supply and install home renewables under the SCHRI, threatening jobs and foregoing employment opportunities; acknowledges the recent announcement of a &pound;59.2 million fund for renewables and micro-renewables in Northern Ireland, a significantly more generous package than the funding hitherto available in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to act without delay to reinstate the SCHRI with increased funding sufficient to meet the growing demand for home renewables in Scotland and to restore confidence in the Scottish home renewables industry.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4389</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Contraceptive Services for Drug Users</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the provision of contraceptive services must be underpinned by the concepts of reproductive rights and, crucially, women&rsquo;s right to choose whether and how to control their own fertility; notes the challenges in providing such services to individuals suffering from drug addiction but considers that much more needs to be done to develop the options, make them available and encourage uptake where appropriate; welcomes any serious and considered contributions to this debate, but, however, is deeply concerned that ill-considered and simplistic proposals could fuel rumours of &quot;spiked&quot; methadone and thereby lead to patients failing to continue with their prescriptions or other treatment.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4362</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Canongate Redevelopment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the regeneration of the Canongate area but notes serious concerns about the current proposals and believes that the master plan put forward by Mountgrange fails to respect the very special character of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Old Town; further notes that the Royal Mile acts as a main artery for the city with narrow closes and wynds flowing left and right, towering buildings rising on either side and sloping sharply downhill; believes that this &quot;herring-bone&quot; pattern has been established over many centuries, and makes a powerful and lasting impression; further believes that this historic scale, pattern and architecture must be used to set the parameters of the development; considers that the master plan fails to recognise this and also believes that it constitutes a risk of becoming a bland development which could exist anywhere instead of at the heart of a World Heritage site; notes three main concerns over the current master plan:  firstly, the proposal to demolish buildings on the Canongate in order to provide a new road is simply not justified, noting that the existing continuous line of buildings along the Canongate is a vital ingredient in the special character of the Old Town as they add to the streetscape and were thoughtfully designed to match the style of architecture in the Canongate; secondly, the proposal to demolish listed buildings in other parts of the site is not justified as these buildings are listed because of their architectural merit and because they add to the character and setting of the Canongate, noting that the master plan proposes to demolish then replace them with buildings of inappropriate size and scale which will change the character of the area, further noting that reusing existing buildings avoids not just the cost but the energy required to create new buildings and believing that there is no justification for demolition other than for short-term economic gain; thirdly, notes that the street layout and size of buildings proposed do not complement the historic pattern and scale that the Old Town of Edinburgh is rightly famous for; considers that the proposed streets are not of a domestic scale and do not create a people-friendly environment; believes that the proposed buildings do not reflect the narrow and tall designs so typical of the area and do not respect the shape of the valley that separates the old and new towns; concurs with the Cockburn Association and Edinburgh World Heritage that, with more thought and recognition of the significance of the Old Town within the World Heritage Site, a better master plan can be developed which respects the special character of the Canongate and the aspirations of the local community as well as the aims of the city council and developer to regenerate the city, and resolves to assert that Edinburgh is a unique and special place and that its character must be preserved and celebrated.</p>
