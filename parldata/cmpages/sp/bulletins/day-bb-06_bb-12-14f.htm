<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5324</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Bethany Christian Trust&rsquo;s &quot;Passing the Baton&quot; Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises Bethany Christian Trust&rsquo;s pioneering work to relieve the suffering, and meet the needs, of homeless and vulnerable people in Scotland; congratulates Bethany on its &quot;Passing the Baton&quot; pilot in Niddrie in south-east Edinburgh which has successfully resettled 16 homeless people by rebuilding community relationships that tackle the loneliness and isolation which often leads to repeated homelessness; notes that the &pound;10,000 cost of the pilot will result in a significant saving to society and the public purse, and encourages the Scottish Executive to support similar pilots elsewhere to test options for wider application of similar schemes.</p>
<p>Supported by: Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Susan Deacon<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong>, Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong>, Dr Sylvia Jackson<strong>*</strong>, Gordon Jackson<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Dr Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong>, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, David McLetchie<strong>*</strong>, Alex Fergusson<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Tricia Marwick<strong>*</strong>, Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5323</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>A Dog is for Life</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the sterling work of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA); notes that from January to November this year a record number of 4,956 dogs were abandoned and taken into SSPCA kennels, with 324 currently in &quot;foster care&quot;; further notes that the SSPCA currently has no kennel space available; notes that the society is even receiving abusive calls from dog owners who, in the run-up to Christmas, seek to abandon their dogs, and therefore urges the Scottish government to support the SSPCA in its call to the public not to buy pets for Christmas presents, many of which are abandoned once the tree and the tinsel are down.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5322</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>Peace Process in the Basque Country</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the current initiative to bring a democratic conclusion to the political conflict in the Basque country and urges all participants to overcome the current impasse and move forward to direct talks at the earliest opportunity, for the sake of peace, progress and democracy.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5321</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulation to Nuclear Free Local Authorities on Vote to Abolish Nuclear Weapons</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Nuclear Free Local Authorities on its annual general meeting vote to call for the abolition of UK nuclear weapons and the redirection of resources to support the development of public services and tackle climate change that was passed unanimously on 7 December 2006; notes that the resolution agreed with the report of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission,<em> Weapons of Terror</em>, which stated that &quot;Nuclear, biological and chemical arms are the most inhumane of all weapons. Designed to terrify as well as destroy, they can, in the hands of either states or non-state actors, cause destruction on a vastly greater scale than any conventional weapons, and their impact is far more indiscriminate and long-lasting. So long as any state has such weapons - especially nuclear arms - others will want them. So long as any such weapons remain in any state&rsquo;s arsenal, there is a high risk that they will one day be used, by design or accident. Any such use would be catastrophic&quot;; agrees with the report&rsquo;s statement that &quot;Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations and non government actors should commence preparations for a World Summit on disarmament, non-proliferation and terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction to generate new momentum for concerted international action&quot;, and therefore supports Nuclear Free Local Authorities&rsquo; call for the Westminster Government to (a) give support to a world summit, (b) signal its resolve to strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation regime by terminating any further work on a replacement for Trident and (c) announce an early date to withdraw the Trident fleet from active service and shares its support for all lawful campaign action in the United Kingdom to secure support for no Trident replacement and its support for the work of international Mayors for Peace and endorses its 2020 Vision campaign that calls for international agreement by 2010 on a nuclear weapons convention to dismantle nuclear weapons by 2020.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5317</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Make Women Safe - Stop Male Violence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply concerned by the discovery of five women&rsquo;s bodies in the Ipswich area and offers its condolences to the friends and families of the murdered women, Tania Nicol, Gemma Adams and Anneli Alderton and of Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls who are currently missing, noting that all are, first and foremost, women, daughters, sisters, mothers and friends who may have been murdered by a predator who has preyed on their vulnerability as women abused through prostitution; is appalled that violence against women is endemic in our society and manifested most brutally in such murders; recognises that in Scotland many murders of women remain unsolved and believes that society and all agencies must take responsibility for bringing the perpetrators to justice and making women safe from male violence against them; believes that society, government and all agencies must work towards the eradication of abuse of women through prostitution and the harm it causes; believes that protection for women must be increased in the short term and that vulnerable women, many of whom are addicted to drugs, must be given the support and services needed within the NHS including, importantly, prescribed medications such as the Diamorphine substitute for heroin, in order to remove their need to raise money through prostitution and to ensure their safety; expresses concern about some public and media statements that place the responsibility on women to avoid being murdered rather than on those men who perpetrate the violence; believes that telling women to be safe when they have little control over poverty, drug and alcohol addictions and mental health issues is an abdication of responsibility; further believes that there should be an amnesty for all women involved in prostitution so that they can seek and access services free from fear and that there should be a zero tolerance approach to the men who buy the use of women&rsquo;s orifices and who are violent to women and that the emphasis of the discourse on these issues must switch to the swift identification of men who present a risk to women rather than on the lifestyles of women; calls on women and men throughout the country to unite against men&rsquo;s violence against women, and calls on government to ensure that all agencies and services have adequate resources to make and keep women safe, believing that women should have the right to go about their lives free from fear.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5316</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Information and Support for Polish Non-UK Nationals in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Lloyds TSB Scotland&rsquo;s work to improve accessibility to bank accounts for Polish-speaking non-UK nationals in Scotland; notes that information on Lloyds TSB Scotland&rsquo;s current accounts is now available in a Polish-English bilingual format; further welcomes Lloyds TSB Scotland&rsquo;s decision to provide the Polish version of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s <em>Welcome to Scotland for Migrant Workers </em>in its branches; believes that Polish nationals are making a positive contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s economy and communities and that this initiative demonstrates an innovative and socially responsible approach to banking in Scotland, and welcomes similar initiatives by public sector agencies and trade unions, such as the Transport and General Workers&rsquo; Union, in giving new migrant workers access to advice to ensure that they understand their rights and are able to play a full part in Scottish economic life.</p>
