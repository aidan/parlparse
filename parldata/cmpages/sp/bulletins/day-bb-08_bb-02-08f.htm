<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1334#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Happy Birthday Glasgow Old People&rsquo;s Welfare Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow Old People&rsquo;s Welfare Association (GOPWA) on the occasion of its 60th anniversary; notes that since its foundation on 23 February 1948 it has grown into an organisation which currently has over 2,000 volunteers assisting with its activities; acknowledges its provision of an unparalleled level of support to an estimated 75% of Glasgow&rsquo;s 120,000 senior citizens, support which includes entertainment, new skills training, advocacy and income maximisation services, letter writing facilities and residential care and which, over the last five years, has helped Glasgow&rsquo;s senior citizens claim over &pound;10 million in benefits; salutes the contribution made to society by Scotland&rsquo;s senior citizens, and wishes both the director, Sheena Glass, and all those involved continued success in making GOPWA such a unique and significant organisation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1333</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Wilson Doctrine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the public debate on surveillance which has been sparked by revelations of the bugging of Sadiq Khan MP; further notes the existence of the Wilson Doctrine which affords MPs some protection from surveillance while carrying out their duties; believes that there are inherent weaknesses in the doctrine and that its application has not been consistent; recognises that debate on these issues seems likely to lead to new rules defining the limits of surveillance in politics; believes that any such rules must include an absolute ban on the political use of information gained from surveillance activity and must also protect the right of members of the public to consult confidentially their elected representatives at all levels, in particular those who have responsibility for aspects of the justice system; further believes that the same restrictions should also apply to confidential access to legal advice, and calls on the Scottish Government to initiate discussions with the UK Government to ensure that the role of MSPs is recognised as equivalent to that of MPs for these purposes and respected in the rules governing the use of surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1332</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>No to Go Ape Development in Pollok Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament opposes the proposed Go Ape private adventure course proposals for Pollok Park in Glasgow; is concerned at the inevitable disruption which it considers will result from any such development to the beauty and tranquillity of this public resource which is used by both locals and visitors to the city; is aware that this parkland was gifted to the citizenry of Glasgow on the proviso that such developments should not be sanctioned, and is conscious of and supports the large and growing local opposition to this form of private development in Pollok Park on the basis that such costly private entertainment has no place in any public park in Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1331</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Anorexia and Bulimia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with unease that it is estimated that more than 80,000 people in Scotland suffer from anorexia, with 4,700 suffering from bulimia, and that the number of people diagnosed with eating disorders has increased by more than 15% since 1999, according to NHS Scotland; is aware that, despite guidelines issued by the health service watchdog in November 2006, Scotland still trails behind the rest of the western world in the treatment of eating disorders; is aware that the foremost expert on anorexia and bulimia in the United Kingdom, Bryan Lask, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of London, has voiced concern that the system for treating those with eating disorders in Scotland is &quot;positively dangerous&quot;; regrets that there is still no specific advice for GPs, despite every practice having patients suffering from eating disorders, and that only two centres in Edinburgh and Glasgow provide specialist care at a cost of around &pound;3,000 per patient per week; asks the Scottish Government to examine why there is not one consultant specialising in eating disorders employed by the NHS in Scotland and to consider how best to tackle this problem which can prove fatal and is deeply distressing both for patients and their families, and understands the need for ongoing research into eating disorders and their treatment.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1330</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Proposed Go Ape High Wire Adventure Facility in Pollok Country Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament accepts the idea of a Go Ape high wire adventure facility in an appropriate location but, given that Pollok Country Park is environmentally, socially and culturally unique, is extremely concerned by Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s decision in February 2007 to grant a 21-year lease of sites in the North Wood, a natural unspoilt forest within the park, to Adventure Forest Ltd without consulting Pollok Country Park users or the local councillor at the time; questions the validity of the public consultation subsequently carried out by the council&rsquo;s Land and Environmental Services in the summer of 2007 in which local residents considered that they were denied their proper right to have a say on the proposal; believes with dismay that Glasgow City Council politicians and officials have shown a complete disregard for the overwhelming opposition to this proposal from the local community and residents across Greater Glasgow, and urges Glasgow City Council to reconsider these ill-thought-out plans by going back to the drawing board and conducting a fresh consultation which would allow a new site to be considered as more appropriate for Go Ape, thus ensuring that the people of Greater Glasgow and the many visitors from elsewhere across the country can continue to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the North Wood of Pollok Country Park, one of the greatest gifts given to the people of Glasgow, the west of Scotland and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1329</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Rights of Children of Prisoners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of <em>Not Seen. Not Heard. Not Guilty: The Rights and Status of the Children of Prisoners in Scotland</em> by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland; notes that the report finds that an estimated 13,500 children in Scotland are affected at any one time by the imprisonment of a parent and that when sentencing options are being considered the impact on the child is rarely taken into account; believes that the rights of children must be taken into account when sentencing and offender policy is considered, and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s moves to reduce the number of custodial sentences for minor offences, especially where mothers with children are concerned.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1328</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Bring Berwick Back</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the referendum campaign in Berwick-upon-Tweed, 990 years after the town was ceded to Scotland following the Battle of Carham, to gauge support for the town being returned to the fold of Scottish nationhood; notes that Berwickers are once again considering the benefits of being part of Scotland; recognises the strong levels of support in the town for such a move, which sees the benefits that Scotland has derived from slowly removing the barriers to progress and prosperity by becoming increasingly independent of London control; agrees that we would warmly welcome Berwick-upon-Tweed back into the nation of Scotland as we move to regaining our full independence, and urges Scottish ministers to begin negotiations with HM Government to secure Berwick-upon-Tweed&rsquo;s restoration as part of the nation of Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1327</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Scottish Science Funding Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the funding crisis at&nbsp;the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), the effects of which, as well as reductions in new physics grants for Scotland&rsquo;s universities, will see reductions in funding for the United Kingdom Astronomy Technology Centre (UKATC) by 50% over the next three years; recognises that this funding has been vital to the continued existence of these organisations which have been responsible for many world-leading instruments for the world&rsquo;s astronomers, have pioneered the successful Dark Sky Scotland scheme and have provided support to hundreds of science teachers to encourage young people in Scotland into science; deplores the actions of the STFC in disproportionately reducing the funding in Scotland, and calls on MPs at Westminster to reassess the funding for science in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1326</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Children of Prisoners: The Invisible Victims of Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the findings of <em>Not Seen. Not Heard. Not Guilty: The Rights and Status of the Children of Prisoners in Scotland</em>, published by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland; further notes that the report sets out serious concerns about the welfare of children in this situation, in particular highlighting the problems with the approach taken to prison visits and the failure of the justice system to recognise the rights of the child in these difficult circumstances, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that better facilities are provided for children to see their parents or carers in Scotland&rsquo;s prisons.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1324*#*</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>2008: Women and the Vote</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 6 February 2008 is the 90th anniversary of women winning the right to vote and be elected to parliament under the 1918 Representation of the People Act; further notes that this year is also the 80th anniversary of women being granted equal voting rights; believes that much still remains to be done to achieve full equality for women, and therefore welcomes the formation of 2008: Women and the Vote, bringing together organisations to celebrate, assess the current situation, and ask all political parties and central and local government to put this issue at the top of their political agendas.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1281</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>50th Anniversary of Scottish CND</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament on the occasion of its 50th anniversary; notes that the UK Government&rsquo;s plan to renew and replace Trident would have an impact on matters devolved to the Scottish Parliament for the next 50 years; expresses concern that the UK Government is spending &pound;2.7 billion at Aldermaston over the next three years; urges the majority of Scottish Westminster MPs of all parties who voted against Trident renewal on 14 March 2007 to continue their opposition to that policy at Westminster with a view to overturning it in due course, and supports the 50th anniversary rally which will be held at Aldermaston on 24 March 2008.</p>
