          <p><strong>*S2M-709</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Superfast 
            Ferries Workers' Rights</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the 
            management of Superfast Ferries to ensure equal job opportunities 
            for seafarers throughout the EU region as well as from the flag state, 
            Greece; calls for the management of Superfast to ensure equality of 
            pay and conditions for all seafarers from both within and outwith 
            the EU region, and supports the implementation of the proposed EU 
            Directive on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services 
            operating between member states.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-708</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Royal 
            Environmental Health Institute of Scotland's Work</strong>-That the 
            Parliament congratulates the Royal Environmental Health Institute 
            of Scotland on its important role in improving public health in the 
            19th and 20th centuries by helping to tackle air pollution, polluted 
            water supplies, unsafe food and overcrowding, and supports the evolving 
            role of environment health officers in the 21st century as they continue 
            to contribute to the well-being of Scottish communities.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-707</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Grassy 
            Narrows</strong>-That the Parliament supports the commitment and dedication 
            of the people of Grassy Narrows First Nation, Ontario, Canada, on 
            the first anniversary of their road blockade erected to protect their 
            land and their way of life and in protest at the devastating logging 
            activities of Abitibi-Consolidated; recognises that the deforestation 
            currently taking place is having a significant and direct impact on 
            the First Nation's treaty and aboriginal rights, and supports the 
            choice of the people of Grassy Narrows to remain on the blockade until 
            this issue is resolved.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-706#</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>The 
            Future of the Scottish Legal System</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            that, if the supreme court proposed by the Prime Minister becomes 
            part of the Royal Courts of Justice, it cannot have jurisdiction over 
            Scottish courts which are protected by the Treaty of Union; notes 
            that Scottish civil cases can be appealed to the House of Lords whilst 
            Scottish criminal appeals cannot be so appealed; considers that the 
            Minister for Justice should engage in consultations with Scottish 
            judges, the legal profession, organisations concerned with advising 
            the public on legal issues and MSPs on the implications of the Prime 
            Minister's proposals for the Scottish legal system, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should ensure that the views of the Scottish 
            Parliament, and not the United Kingdom Parliament, on the future of 
            the Scottish legal system are paramount.</P>
