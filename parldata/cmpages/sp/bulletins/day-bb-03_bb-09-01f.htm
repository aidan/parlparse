            in the establishment of Britain's nuclear waste Liabilities Management 
            Agency; notes that this corporation has on at least four occasions 
            penalised workers for exposing safety risks in its American nuclear 
            plants; further notes that this corporation aided the construction 
            of a chemical plant in Iraq prior to the first Gulf War; notes that 
            Bechtel was proposed by Donald Rumsfeld to Saddam Hussein for the 
            construction of an Iraqi pipeline, and in light of these points calls 
            on Her Majesty's Government to reconsider its position with regard 
            to the Bechtel Corporation's involvement in the safe handling of Britain's 
            nuclear waste.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-279</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Voting 
            Reform</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recalls that the voting system 
            for elections to the Parliament was settled upon after extensive discussions 
            with Scottish society through the Scottish Constitutional Convention 
            and was endorsed by the Scottish people in the 1997 referendum on 
            the establishment of a Parliament; notes that the composition of the 
            Parliament is vastly more representative of the people of Scotland 
            than either the Westminster Parliament or local authorities throughout 
            Scotland; considers that before there is a change in the voting system 
            for the Parliament there should be a reconvening of the convention 
            and full consultation of the Scottish people at which not only the 
            voting system, but the powers of the Parliament, are considered, and 
            believes that the most urgent matter regarding voting systems is the 
            requirement for reform of the systems for Westminster and local government 
            elections.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-278</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Hamilton

            recognises the many potential dangers facing young people using the 
            internet from paedophiles and adults attempting to &quot;groom&quot; 
            youngsters; notes that it is vital that parents, schools, local communities 
            and the police work together to protect youngsters from such threats, 
            and congratulates the Hamilton District Crime Prevention Panel for 
            publishing and distributing its leaflet <em>A parent&#146;s guide 
            to internet safety</em>, aimed at helping educate parents and children 
            about the risks for children using the internet, which is an excellent 
            example of communities working together to eradicate such crime.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-277</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Stirling's 
            Appeal to Secure William Wallace Portrait</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            commends the efforts of Stirling&#146;s Smith Art Gallery and Museum 
            to secure a rare 17th century portrait of William Wallace originally 
            owned by the Wauchopes of Niddrie Marischal, Edinburgh; notes that 
            the gallery has launched an appeal to raise £20,000 to purchase the 
            picture from a private collection in London, and believes that, if 
            this is successful, the portrait would greatly enhance the Smith&#146;s 
            permanent collection of Wallace artefacts, as well as forming an integral 
            part of its major exhibition to commemorate the 700th anniversary 
            of the death of Wallace, scheduled to be held in summer 2005.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-276</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Pizza 
            Hut Smoking Ban</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the recent 
            announcement by Pizza Hut of a ban on smoking in all of its UK restaurants; 
            notes that the decision was reached in order to protect staff and 
            customers from the dangers of passive smoking; believes that, by making 
            its restaurants smoke-free, Pizza Hut will have a positive impact 
            on its business, and notes that its decision is in response to customer 
            demand for smoke-free restaurants.</p>

            future of the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) in Almondbank; 
            is concerned about the threat to the 325 jobs at the facility; recognises 
            the important and specialised skills of the workforce there which 
            are significant to both Perthshire locally and Scotland as a whole; 
            acknowledges the massive local economic impact of DARA in Almondbank 
            as evidenced by the Mackay Consultants&#146; report of August 2003; 
            further notes the cross party and multi-agency Welsh campaign to defend 
            DARA jobs in Wales, and believes that the Scottish Executive should
