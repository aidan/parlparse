              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S2M-1925.2</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Ambitious, Excellent Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1925) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the publication of the proposed changes to education contained in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s <em>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</em> but is concerned that many of the proposals are structural, administrative and managerial in nature, depend from a resource perspective on the short-sighted presumption of continued falling school rolls and that, although they may have an impact on the educational experience of a few pupils, they will not provide comprehensive change for all and are centred on a national curriculum review which will deliver only in 2007 after the current generation of pupils has passed though school under Labour ministers of education, and urges the Executive to provide a shared national vision and strategy for education which the nation can contribute to by establishing a National Education Convention to address the persistent under-achievement of 20% of pupils and to provide a pupil-centric education system which can create the conditions for success for this generation of school pupils.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1925.1</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Ambitious, Excellent Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1925) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s agenda described in <em>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</em>; recognises, however, that, in order to achieve its aim of promoting ambition and encouraging excellence, schools must be granted greater autonomy and that public funds must be allowed to follow the pupil to any school of the parents&rsquo; choosing so that parents can exercise genuine choice between schools and not just within schools, encouraging the expansion of popular schools and the upgrading of unsuccessful schools.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1925.3</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne: Ambitious, Excellent Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1925) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that all Scottish schools should be ambitious, excellent schools and that a first move towards achieving this would be to reduce all non-practical class sizes to 20 and all practical class sizes to 15 or less as part of a national minimum class size policy.&quot; </p>
