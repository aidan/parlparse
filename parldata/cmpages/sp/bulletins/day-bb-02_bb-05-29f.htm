          <p> <strong>*S1M-3159</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Appointment

            the Catholic Relief Act of 1829 continues to prohibit the appointment 
            of a Catholic as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of 
            the Church of Scotland; further notes that virtually all other provisions 
            of this outmoded and discriminatory act have been repealed and that, 
            whilst the position of Lord High Commissioner is a non-ecclesiastical 
            appointment by Her Majesty the Queen with no liturgical or religious 
            function in the Church of Scotland, it has great significance and 
            prominence in Scotland at the time of the Kirk's General Assembly; 
            observes that the Church and Nation Committee of the Church of Scotland 
            is taking a commendable stance on issues of sectarianism and the need 
            to root them out from Scottish society, and suggests that the Church 
            of Scotland join with the Scottish Parliament in encouraging Her Majesty's 
            Government to repeal this provision in the Catholic Relief Act and 
            in exhorting Her Majesty the Queen to appoint a Catholic to the position 
            of Lord High Commissioner for 2003 as a mark of reconciliation and 
            as a sign of national determination to have done with institutionalised

          <p><strong>*S1M-3158</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Smoking in

            notes its tolerant attitude to smoking in public places, its advocacy 
            of tolerance of non-smokers rights by smokers and vice versa, and, 
            in recognition of this adult and liberal approach, calls for the charter 
            to be employed in the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood, 
            for a suitably sized room with air cleaning equipment to be located 
            at Holyrood for the benefit of smokers and non-smokers alike and for

          <p><strong>*S1M-3157</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Central Scotland 
            Police Headquarters</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes

            board have instigated a report which will examine the feasibility 
            of relocating the force's headquarters from Randolphfield, Stirling, 
            to a new site in Falkirk; believes that this proposal is being put 
            forward for partisan and parochial reasons and without regard to the 
            impact on either headquarters staff or police finances, and further 
            believes that the proposal is an unnecessary distraction from the 
            greater priorities that the police have to deal with, particularly 
            the growth in crime which, according to the Scottish Executive's own 
            statistics, has risen by 25% in Clackmannanshire, 9% in Stirling, 
            and 3% in Falkirk since 1997.</a></p>

            concerned that this announcement, without any consultation or published 
            assessment of the potential impact it will have on jobs and sustainable 
            investment in the sector, could jeopardise employment levels, the 
            survival of many companies involved in servicing and contracting to 
            the industry, and the future success of a vital Scottish industry 
            which in turn could place at risk any plans for effective and sustainable 
            diversification, and therefore calls for a moratorium on the imposition 
            of this tax until a full assessment is made, and published, of the 
            sectoral and overall economic impact it will have including its impact

            fuels; notes that, contrary to the assertion that increased air links 
            generate economic gains, pollution from air transport contributes 
            a major hidden cost to the economy, and therefore calls on the Scottish 
            Executive (a) to bring about a reduction in the demand for air links 
            by investment in less-polluting alternative modes of public transport 
            and by promoting alternatives to business air travel including state 
            of the art electronic communications, (b) to support a European level 
            charge on aviation based on aircraft emissions and support an end 
            to any public subsidies and tax exemptions for aviation, and (c) to

            recognises that passenger numbers through Scottish airports are continuing

            report by the Highlands and Islands Strategic Transport Partnership

            Transport Consultation Document which will provide a full and inclusive
