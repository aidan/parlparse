Robison: Records of Property Ownership</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
that many communal properties in the ownership of private landlords receive no 
maintenance and little repair; recognises that these properties blight surrounding 
areas; acknowledges the good work of local councils in trying to enforce repair 
works, and believes that the Scottish Executive should assist local councils in 
this work by making records of property ownership readily available to them.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3712</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tavish Scott: Scotland's Fishing Communities</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
<A NAME="MotionText">notes with concern the open letter to fishermen from European 
Commissioner Franz Fischler issued last week; challenges his statement that the 
European Union would not be forcing anyone to scrap their boats or to give up 
fishing if the European Commission&#146;s recommended white fish total allowable 
catches were accepted by the Fisheries Council; notes with dismay the implication 
that Mr Fischler is using the lure of fleet subsidies to win support from southern 
EU member states when expansion of their fleets is inappropriate in the current 
circumstances; reaffirms its full support for Scotland&#146;s fishing communities, 
and calls on the Scottish Executive to continue to give its full backing to the 
Scottish white fish industry.</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3710# Digital Hearing Aids</STRONG>
