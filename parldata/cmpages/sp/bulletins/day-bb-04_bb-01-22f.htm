          <p><strong>*S2M-812</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Conduct 
            of Health Review Consultations</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            that public consultations on NHS centralisations, redesigns, rationalisations 
            and closures are repeatedly being condemned and questioned by the 
            public, trade unions, community representatives and clinicians in 
            terms of their transparency, processes, democracy, accountability 
            and legitimacy of conclusions; believes that public confidence in 
            NHS board consultations is extremely low; is concerned by allegations 
            made by senior clinicians, in respect of the Queen Mother's Hospital 
            consultation by NHS Greater Glasgow, that evidence has been distorted 
            and/or suppressed, and considers that all submissions, written or 
            oral, to such consultations should, by mandate, be published in full 
            with all documentation, evidence, statistics and research.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-811#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>London 
            Olympic Bid</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the decision 
            by Her Majesty's Government to provide an unlimited funding guarantee 
            for the London bid to host the Olympic Games in 2012 and, whilst happy 
            to support the bid's success, believes that London should share financial 
            responsibility for the guarantee in line with the original intention 
            of Her Majesty's Government, outlined in the response to <em>A London 
            Olympic Bid for 2012</em> by the Department for Culture, Media and 
            Sport.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-810</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Saudi 
            Arabian Ambassador's Reception</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the US Department of State's report on Saudi Arabia which states that 
            Saudi citizens have &quot;neither the right nor the legal means to 
            change their government&quot;, that &quot;security forces continued 
            to abuse detainees and prisoners, arbitrarily arrest and detain persons, 
            and hold them in incommunicado detention&quot;, that &quot;the Government 
            prohibits or restricts freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, 
            religion and movement&quot; and that &quot;other continuing problems 
            included discrimination and violence against women, discrimination 
            against ethnic and religious minorities, and strict limitations on 
            worker rights&quot;; believes that it is completely unacceptable for 
            any member to accept an invitation to dine with the Ambassador of 
            Saudi Arabia, Prince Turki Al Faisal, on 26<SUP> </SUP>January 2004 
            in Edinburgh as he is an official representative of a dictatorial 
            and oppressive regime, and calls on all members to boycott this reception.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-809</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Access 
            to Scottish Current Accounts from the Post Office</strong>-That the 
            Parliament urges the Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS plc and the Clydesdale 
            Bank to match the facilities, offered by other UK banks, for customers 
            to access their current accounts at post office branches nationwide, 
            which will both increase footfall in Post Offices and allow improved 
            access to banking for geographically remote and socially excluded 
            communities.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Des McNulty<strong>*</strong>, Dennis Canavan<strong>*</strong>, 
            Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Helen Eadie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-808</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Consultations on Parliamentary Issues</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees that it should give more financial support to enable MSPs to 
            organise local consultation on parliamentary issues, not just on local 
            issues, and should help to fund the travel costs of citizens who have 
            to go a long way to a consultative meeting.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-807</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Budget 
            (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees to the general 
            principles of the Budget (Scotland) Bill.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-806.1</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Comprehensive 
            Programme of Education Reforms</strong>-As an amendment to motion 
            (S2M-806) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;notes the Scottish Executive's additional 
            financial support and reform programme for school education; welcomes 
            its belated adoption of longstanding SNP policies on the principle 
            of class size reduction, tackling the bureaucratic problems associated 
            with national tests and the damaging impact of the national publication 
            of school league tables; looks forward to the Parliament's involvement 
            in the review and reform of the curriculum, in the opportunities available 
            around the transition period of pupils into primary, secondary and 
            post-14 education and in additional support for learning, and calls 
            on the Executive to ensure that resources, in particular sufficient 
            properly trained and qualified teachers, are in place to meet these 
            demands.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-806.2</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> 
            <strong>Comprehensive Programme of Education Reforms</strong>-As an 
            amendment to motion (S2M-806) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave 
            out from first &quot;and&quot; to end and insert &quot; for school 
            education, but believes that the Scottish Executive's reform programme 
            for school education is insufficient to deal with the inherent problems 
            thrown up by Scotland's comprehensive system and that the Scottish 
            educational system needs radical reform, and would therefore support 
            any visit by the Minister for Education and Young People to New Zealand 
            in order that he can be inspired by New Zealand's devolved and diverse 
            system, where, for the last 16 years under Labour and Conservative 
            governments, schools have been managed by local school boards and 
            parents have chosen the schools that their children attend, similar 
            to the schools passport policy advocated by Scottish Conservatives.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-803.1</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Impact 
            of Top-up Fees on Higher Education in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment 
            to motion (S2M-803) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, insert after &quot;Scottish 
            higher education&quot; &quot;; further believes that education should 
            be paid for through a progressive taxation system that taxes higher 
            earners appropriately, unlike the current British situation; believes, 
            therefore, that society should levy taxes on earning rather than learning,&quot;.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-803.2</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Impact 
            of Top-up Fees on Higher Education in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment 
            to motion (S2M-803) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;recognises that Scotland's distinctive higher 
            education system is a valuable asset which must be maintained and 
            developed for the good of the nation; further recognises that its 
            competitive advantage must be maintained; welcomes the commitment 
            in the Partnership Agreement that the Executive &quot;will not support 
            the introduction of top-up tuition fees&quot; in Scotland; notes that 
            the Enterprise and Culture Committee's report on its Scottish Solutions 
            Inquiry considers that the Executive's decision to respond to developments 
            in England by proceeding with a third phase of its higher education 
            review in order to establish a robust evidence base &quot;is wholly 
            appropriate&quot;, and looks forward to this third phase of the review 
            reporting in the early spring.&quot;</P>
          <p>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-803.3</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Impact 
            of Top-up Fees on Higher Education in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment 
            to motion (S2M-803) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;will&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;imposing top-up fees may have an adverse effect 
            on Scottish higher education; calls on the Scottish Executive to set 
            out its proposals for dealing with any consequential impact on Scottish 
            universities and on Scottish students if top-up fees are introduced 
            in England; rejects the politically opportunistic stance of the SNP 
            on this issue which is intended to destabilise the Union, and calls 
            on all Scottish MPs to follow the lead of Peter Duncan MP, Shadow 
            Secretary of State for Scotland, and abstain from voting on this Bill 
            and, indeed, all Bills that relate only to England and/or Wales.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-801#</strong> <strong>Yorkhill NHS Trust Staff</strong> 
            (lodged on 20 January 2004) Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-798.1</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> 
            <strong>Fisheries Council December 2003</strong>-As an amendment to 
            motion (S2M-798) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;discriminates&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;is unjust and discriminates against Scottish 
            fishermen and has produced, in the words of Ross Finnie, &quot;unintended 
            consequences&quot; which further reduce the catching powers of the 
            white fish fleet; commends the efforts of the Scottish Fishermen's 
            Federation and Fishermen's Association Ltd to mount legal challenges 
            to the agreement, and seeks urgent clarification from the European 
            Commission on the technical adjustments to no-go areas.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-798.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Fisheries 
            Council December 2003</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-798) 
            in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;and therefore&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;supports the fishermen in whatever action 
            they choose to take, including civil disobedience, to safeguard their 
            livelihood and their communities and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to withdraw its support for this agreement and demand an immediate 
            renegotiation of the agreement.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-798.3</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Fisheries 
            Council December 2003</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-798) 
            in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;condemns political attitudes which set aside 
            the finding of marine science; recognises the importance of conserving 
            fish stocks and regenerating them for the long-term future health 
            of fishing communities; notes the precarious state of many species 
            and the need for urgent action; welcomes the new EU fisheries agreement, 
            whilst far from ideal, as a step in the right direction, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive, together with Her Majesty's Treasury, to 
            draw upon available EU funds to deliver an investment package in fishing 
            communities to see them through the fish recovery programme.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-798.4</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>Fisheries 
            Council December 2003</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-798) 
            in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;supports the more balanced outcome negotiated 
            by ministers at the December Fisheries Council; welcomes the fact 
            that this will benefit many sections of the Scottish fishing industry 
            while ensuring conservation of key stocks on which the long-term viability 
            of the industry depends; deplores the calls by the SNP leader for 
            fishermen to break the law; recognises that there are elements of 
            the detailed agreement which are the subject of further technical 
            discussion with the European Commission; supports the efforts made 
            by the Scottish Executive to address these, and further supports the 
            willingness of Scottish Ministers to monitor the socio-economic impact 
            on fishermen, ports and communities following the conclusions of the 
            technical discussions and EU negotiations with Norway with a view 
            to taking appropriate action if necessary.&quot;</P>
