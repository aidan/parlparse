    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-683#</b> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Edinburgh Marathon</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament believes that the 1999 Puma Edinburgh Marathon was a success generating over
    £600,000 in economic benefit for Fife and Edinburgh, regrets that Fife Council has,
    because of budget constraints, decided that it is unable to commit £100,000 towards the
    cost of running the event this year; believes that it is vital that the Edinburgh Marathon
    should continue as an international event and as such has a massive growth potential which
    would, with proper niche marketing, benefit the tourist economy to the tune of over £3
    million pounds by the year 2002; invites the Scottish Executive to take urgent steps with
    a view to seeking to reverse the cancellation of the 2000 Puma Edinburgh Marathon and to
    provide this event with a secure future to benefit Scottish athletes including disabled
    athletes and also to benefit the tourist industry.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-682</b> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Legal Aid SSIs</strong>&#151;That the
    Justice and Home Affairs Committee holds a single debate on motions S1M-668, S1M-667 and
    S1M-666 (motions to approve the Civil Legal Aid (Financial Consultations) (Scotland)
    Regulations 2000; the Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations
    2000 and the Advice and Assistance (Assistance by Way of Representation) (Scotland)
    Amendment Regulations 2000), and that the debate shall last no more than 90 minutes.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-681</b> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Fuel Price Increases</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament believes that the fuel prices increase announced in the Chancellor of the
    Exchequer&#146;s budget on 21 March 2000 are deplorable; acknowledges that this increase
    will have a detrimental effect on the Scottish economy due to its population disparity;
    further believes that these fuel price increases will jeopardise the future viability of
    rural communities, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her
    Majesty's Government demanding that the high fuel prices in Scotland be addressed as a
    matter of urgency. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-679#</b> <strong>Irene McGugan: Scottish Rural Development Indicators</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament acknowledges that rural deprivation has increased in the North East of
    Scotland, impacting significantly on the quality of life of a substantial number of people
    who live and work in the area; notes that recent studies have shown that drug addiction,
    crime, unemployment, poverty and poor health are increasing in Aberdeenshire and that
    current mechanisms and initiatives to alleviate these problems are hampered by the lack of
    any system to accurately measure rural disadvantage to allow effective targeting of
    resources, which has resulted in pockets of extreme deprivation in rural areas being
    ignored, and believes that a long overdue Scottish Rural Deprivation Index, a means of
    collecting local rather than region-wide data and a system which ensures fair and
    equitable allocations of funding should be established and that, in the spirit of
    inclusive and holistic governance, this work should draw on the expertise of political
    representatives of rural areas, academics, voluntary organisations, health and social work
    professionals and representatives of the rural business community.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-678</b> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Bus Drivers' Strike</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with concern the escalation of industrial action by employees of
    Stagecoach in the South West of Scotland; notes the disruption to public and school
    transport caused in such areas such as Dumfries and Galloway; notes that this dispute was
    caused by the company&#146;s withdrawal of their latest pay offer without allowing trade
    union representatives to ballot their members, and requests that the management of
    Stagecoach immediately resume negotiations with trade union representatives with the aim
    of resolving this dispute.<b><i> R</i></p>

    Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;and welcomes the

    an amendment to motion (S1M-675) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from
    &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;and, while recognising the excellence of the
    Scottish biotechnology industry and the benefits that GM technology has the potential to
    provide, calls upon the Scottish Executive to delay the recently announced farm scale
    trials until evidence from previous scientific tests, proving beyond any reasonable doubt
    that such trials pose no threat to the environment or public health, has been thoroughly
    evaluated by a range of independent assessors and placed in the public domain.&quot;<i><strong>

    an amendment to motion (S1M-675) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from
    &quot;commends&quot; to and insert &quot;would welcome a precautionary approach by the
    Scottish Executive and therefore calls, as part of this approach, for a five year
    moratorium on the growing and import of genetically modified food and crops as the only
    effective way of dealing with the public&#146;s concern.&quot;</p>
