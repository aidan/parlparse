<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7586 Christine Grahame: SCCRC, the Megrahi Conviction and SSI 2009/448 Article 2(b)</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers but is not surprised that, in terms of article 2(b) of the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (Permitted Disclosure of Information ) Order 2009, which came into force in February 2010, third parties such as the Crown Office and the Foreign Office and relevant police authorities have refused consent in writing to disclosure of information provided directly or indeed indirectly by them, that parties with an interest in the conviction remain untested, and, as a consequence, that access to undisclosed information has been successfully blocked and therefore urges the Scottish Government to either repeal or amend SSI 2009/448 to remove article 2(b) in the interests of openness, accountability and justice.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7585 Bill Kidd: Carers&rsquo; Missing Millions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern new figures released by Carers Scotland that show that across Scotland 25,852 carers are missing out on a total of &pound;72 million worth of carers allowance each year; considers that failure to claim carers allowance can have a significant impact on carers&rsquo; lives; further notes that Carers Scotland has found that the effects of financial hardship and ill-health can lead to isolation and social exclusion for carers; considers that carers make a huge contribution to Scottish society, and calls on the UK Government to take steps to ensure that carers are made aware of and receive the support to which they are entitled.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Bill Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>

<p><strong>S3M-7536 Gil Paterson: Scottish Cot Death Trust Research Makes its Mark on the World</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that members of the Scottish Cot Death Trust attended the international meeting on cot death in Sydney, Australia, in October 2010; notes that delegates at the meeting accepted the trust&rsquo;s poster presentation and that the trust supported five research papers arising from work carried out by scientists in England, Australia and the United States of America; believes that this is quite an achievement for a small Scottish charity in its 25th anniversary year, and wishes the trust the very best of luck in its endeavours to tackle what it considers to be the scourge of cot death in Scotland and the world as a whole.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7535 Jackie Baillie: Leuchie House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Multiple Sclerosis Society of the continuation of Leuchie House for a period of at least six months; congratulates members of the Save Leuchie Campaign for what it sees as their considerable efforts; further congratulates Mairi O&rsquo;Keefe, the manager of Leuchie House for her work in bringing forward an alternative proposal to secure future provision for people with MS, and wishes her and the staff every success in gaining funding for the future.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7530# Ted Brocklebank: Retention of RAF Leuchars</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that RAF Leuchars plays an essential role in the defence of the United Kingdom; commends the professionalism and dedication of military personnel who have served or serve there; considers that those who have been deployed from Leuchars on active service have given exemplary service since the First World War; believes that the case for RAF Leuchars remaining as one of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s two main fighter strike bases is overwhelming as it has a pivotal strategic position on the east coast and is adjacent to Scotland&rsquo;s major population centres; understands, however, that any considerations on how the United Kingdom&rsquo;s air defences are deployed and where aircraft should be based must be made on strategic grounds, and believes that the Secretary of State for Defence must make his decision on that basis.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7490# Anne McLaughlin: UKBA&rsquo;s Contempt Agenda for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the UK Border Agency (UKBA) for its actions that, it believes, imply a complete lack of respect for the Parliament and the people of Scotland; deplores what it considers to be the chaotic and unfeeling manner in which hundreds of asylum seekers in Glasgow were informed of the cancellation of UKBA&rsquo;s contract with Glasgow City Council and their subsequent imminent removal to elsewhere in Scotland; condemns, in particular, UKBA&rsquo;s decision, following a review, to continue, in its view, to refuse to engage with members seeking to represent constituents; believes that this policy is unique among all UK and Scottish governmental agencies, and considers that both examples demonstrate contempt for asylum seekers, the Parliament and Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7259# Johann Lamont: Support for Children in Family and Friends Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that there is estimated to be a minimum of 13,400 children in kinship (family and friends) care in Glasgow and throughout Scotland; understands that three out of four of these families are living in poverty and that kinship care is frequently the best form of early intervention as well as a longer-term option for children requiring non-parental care, particularly for those who have experienced multiple traumas; notes that kinship care is estimated to save the Scottish Government and local authorities &pound;536 million per year in reduced care costs; considers with regret that the Scottish Government, the UK Government and Scottish local authorities have not yet been able to ensure provision of adequate financial, educational and other supports for children looked after by kinship carers; considers that there is currently insufficient joint working across all levels of government, and believes that kinship care provision is best developed with the involvement of kinship carers themselves as part of the decision-making process and that this would ensure that all policies are based on the needs of the child and that there is no discrimination of kinship carers based on their legal status or postcode.</p>
