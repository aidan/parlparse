            (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) 
            (No.16) (Scotland) Order 2002 </strong>-That the Health and Community 
            Care Committee, in consideration of the Food Protection (Emergency 
            Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.16) (Scotland) 
            Order 2002, recommends that the Order be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3739</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: The Scotland 
            Act 1998 (Transfer of Functions to the Scottish Ministers etc.) Order 
            2003</strong>-That the Justice 1 Committee, in consideration of the 
            Scotland Act 1998 (Transfer of Functions to the Scottish Ministers 
            etc.) Order 2003, recommends that the Order be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3738</strong> <strong>Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh: Fame Academy</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates David Sneddon on winning BBC's Fame Academy 
            and wishes him every success in his future singing and songwriting 
            career.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3737</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Noise Pollution</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the increasing number of complaints of domestic, 
            industrial and street noise; notes the noise impact of the increasing 
            popularity of wooden and laminate flooring in tenement dwellings reducing 
            noise insulation of which many people are not aware; recognises the 
            need for tighter regulation over particular noise pollution such as 
            construction works in residential areas and the rules generally allowing 
            all types of activity seven days a week until 1am with few restrictions; 
            believes that there should be one clear day in the week free from 
            construction noise in residential areas, and considers that there 
            is a need for either new legislation or more restrictive hours applied 
            to certain types of activity with respect to the relevant sections 
            of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3736</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Glasgow City 
            Centre Policing</strong>-That the Parliament notes the extraordinary 
            level of activity in Glasgow City Centre day and night and the intensive 
            policing required of the ever-increasing night economy, particularly 
            of young people attracted to the under-18s clubs; notes that there 
            are approximately 36,000 people in Glasgow city centre four nights 
            each week; notes that Glasgow has the highest level of shoppers in 
            Scotland, being second only to London for UK shopping; notes the increasing 
            occurrence of retail crime and public order disputes in Glasgow; notes 
            that Glasgow has the highest proportion of licensed pubs and clubs 
            outside London; notes the disproportionate responsibility on the city 
            centre police force for maintaining public order in Glasgow city centre 
            which is not recognised as unique in relation to resources allocated 
            through the police funding formula, and considers that there is a 
            case for revisiting the funding formula to provide greater resources 
            for Strathclyde Police Division A.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3735</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Scotland's Fishing 
            Communities</strong>-That the Parliament notes the shameful back-door 
            dealing carried out by the European Commission during the meeting 
            of the EU Fisheries Council in Brussels which demonstrated the double 
            standards applied by the Commission when applying scientific arguments; 
            commends the Scottish Executive and the Scottish fisheries industry 
            for speedily convening a meeting to discuss financial packages to 
            sustain the Scottish fishing industry and fishing communities; calls 
            on all concerned with the future of Scotland's fishing communities 
            to support these constructive negotiations, and further calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to seek funding from the EU for the financial package 
            that will be required because of the targeting of the Scottish industry 
            by the European Commission.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Iain Smith<strong>*</strong>, 
            Mr Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>,

            Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3734</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: UK Support for 
            the Baku-Ceyhan Oil Pipeline</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            public funding is being provided for the proposed Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan 
            oil pipeline from Azerbaijan, through Georgia and Turkey, which is 
            due to be constructed by a BP led consortium; is gravely concerned 
            about the serious impacts the pipeline will have on the global environment 
            by transporting the oil equivalent of nearly 30% of the UK's yearly 
            carbon dioxide output; is further concerned about the impacts of the 
            pipeline on the local environment, on regional tensions and on local 
            populations in its immediate vicinity, and calls on Her Majesty's 
            Government and directors in multilateral development banks to vote 
            against providing funding for the project.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3733</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Christmas Card 
            Recycling</strong>-That the Parliament notes that if every MSP sent 
            every other MSP a Christmas card, over 16,000 cards would be received; 
            therefore welcomes the scheme to recycle Christmas cards whereby between 
            6 January and 2 February 2003 Christmas cards can be taken to all 
            WH Smith and TESCO stores for recycling, and notes that the funds 
            raised by the scheme will help the Woodland Trust, a leading woodland 
            conservation charity, to create and care for new native woodland in 
            Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3732</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Agricultural Holdings

            should proceed as a private bill.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3485#</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Breast Cancer 
            Awareness</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates all the voluntary 
            and research agencies involved for their efforts in highlighting Breast 
            Cancer Awareness Month; recognises the importance of continuing research 
            into the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, building upon major 
            advances achieved over past decades; records its thanks to all the 
            medical and ancillary staff involved for their unstinting kindness 
            and support to patients and their families, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should ensure that funding is made available for 
            increasing awareness, research, providing treatment and support and 
            all other aspects of breast cancer care.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2874#</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon: Drugs and Driving</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">expresses concern about the number 
            of lives lost in road traffic crashes that may have been caused by 
            people driving whilst under the influence of legal and illegal drugs; 
            recognises that, in law, driving while unfit through drugs is an offence; 
            notes that Transport Research Laboratory tests demonstrated a significant 
            increase between the 1980s and 1990s in the percentage of people testing 
            positive for illegal drugs who have been involved in fatal collisions; 
            welcomes the launch by the British Medical Association of its web 
            resource on research that has been undertaken and is currently in 
            progress; considers that there should be speedier and more specific 
            and co-ordinated research in order that appropriate and conclusive 
            drug testing devices can be introduced, and believes that there should 
            be a Scottish campaign in order to educate the public that the side 
            effects of illegal and certain prescribed drugs can affect their ability 
            to drive. </a></p>
