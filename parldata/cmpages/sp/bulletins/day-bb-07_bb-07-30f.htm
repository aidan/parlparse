<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-328</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>RIP Cigarettes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the European Commission to bring forward proposals to ban traditional cigarettes by 2009-10, forcing smokers to buy fire safe or reduced ignition potential (RIP) cigarettes that require constant drags to keep them alight; acknowledges that RIP cigarettes stop burning within two minutes of being put down therefore reducing the number of fires started by smouldering cigarette butts; is aware that cigarettes or other tobacco products sparked 30 of the 76 fatal house fires in Scotland in 2004; notes that 2,000 people across Europe are killed and a further 7,300 injured in house fires caused by cigarettes every year, and supports the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals that will save lives.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-327</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Saltire for Scotland&rsquo;s Capital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the comments by the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture that the Scottish Government should have responsibility for all guidance related to the flying of national flags in Scotland; notes that Edinburgh Castle, one of Scotland&rsquo;s premier tourist attractions, continues to fly the Union Flag in a superior position despite the castle being owned and operated by Historic Scotland, an agency of the Scottish Government; notes the existing guidance to all Scottish non-departmental public bodies and agencies that the Saltire should fly prominently from all public buildings, and urges Historic Scotland to ensure that the Saltire, the oldest national flag in Europe, is restored to its rightful place on the principal flagstaff on Edinburgh Castle.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-326</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Manufacturing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern over the steady decline of the Scottish manufacturing sector in that employment levels have now fallen to 235,000 in Scotland and three million across the United Kingdom; recognises the crucial importance that such secondary industry plays in our economy and our heritage, and calls on the Scottish Executive to develop a more effective manufacturing and public procurement policy that will underpin Scottish manufacturers and to encourage companies to have improved and more meaningful dialogue with workers before making employment decisions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-325</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Carrier Jobs Announcement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Ministry of Defence&rsquo;s announcement of the order of two aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy which will support and create around 10,000 jobs across the United Kingdom, with a significant portion of the economic benefit being felt in Scotland; acknowledges that hundreds of jobs are projected for each of the four worksites including in Rosyth and the west of Scotland, with thousands of support jobs to follow; notes that this announcement compounds further the good news for the Forth Bridgehead area, as the carrier jobs that will result, in conjunction with the construction jobs from a new Forth crossing, will enhance the regeneration taking place across Fife and bolster economic confidence in central Scotland, and celebrates the fact that, as the final job of joining the hull sections of the carriers is slated for the Rosyth shipyard, the eventual launch of the largest UK military vessels ever is likely to be from the Fife shore.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-324&diams; </strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Supporting Renewables in the Highlands and Islands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposals of Ofgem on zonal transmission losses; regrets that the recommendations, coupled with transmission charges and business rates, could see Scottish renewables projects, particularly those in the Highlands and Islands, put at a disadvantage by paying on average 22% of turnover on regulatory costs, while in southern England generators would in effect be receiving a subsidy, and considers that urgent representations should be made to the UK Government to ensure that Scottish renewables projects are not disadvantaged and to consider a reduction in business rates for renewables generators.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-323</strong> <strong>Angela Constance:</strong> <strong>Free Personal Care for the Elderly in West Lothian</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates West Lothian Council on being singled out in a recent report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation as an example of good practice with regard to the provision of free personal care for the elderly; commends the hard work of all the staff involved in the delivery of the service across West Lothian, and invites other local authorities to learn from the good practice provided by West Lothian Council in terms of providing a high-quality service at a relatively low level of expenditure.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-322</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Futures Through Music</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the appointment by UK Government ministers of Undertones frontman and former chair of the UK Live Music Forum, Feargal Sharkey, to spearhead the setting up of a rehearsal studio network to encourage young musicians; notes that 43% of young people who want to participate in music are unable to do so due to lack of facilities and prohibitive costs; calls on the Scottish Executive to continue the work started by previous Scottish ministers in setting up initiatives such as the Scottish Music Futures Fund which was promoted by the Cross-Party Group on the Scottish Contemporary Music Industry, and congratulates the cross-party group for the extensive and valuable work it has done to promote the contribution of contemporary music to Scotland&rsquo;s economy and for its Scottish Music Manifesto, published last year, detailing steps that could be taken to improve conditions for artists and to encourage new talent and increase the accessibility of live music for young people regardless of their background.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-321</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Indian Duty on Whisky Scotched</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the move by the Indian Government to abolish the additional duty currently levied on Scotch whisky imports; recognises that this will allow Scottish distillers to compete fairly with their Indian counterparts for the first time; commends the Scotch Whisky Association for its campaign to reform the system, and welcomes the opportunity to provide consumers in India with a greater choice of internationally renowned Scotch whisky brands.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-319</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Super-Carriers Secure Future of Shipbuilding on the Clyde</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the UK Government of an order worth some &pound;3.8 billion for the United Kingdom&rsquo;s two new aircraft carriers which will help to secure the long-term future of Scotstoun and Govan shipyards; congratulates the 3,000 workers based at the BAE Systems&rsquo; sites in the Glasgow Kelvin and Glasgow Govan constituencies; notes the recruitment of a further 100 designers and 400 other staff to complete this ambitious project and the nature of these high quality employment opportunities, and recognises the commitment of the UK Government and successive Scottish administrations and the work done by Scotland&rsquo;s representatives in Westminster and Holyrood over the last 10 years that has ensured the viability of the Scottish shipbuilding and defence industries on the Clyde and in other areas such as Rosyth.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-318</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Aircraft Carriers at Rosyth and Clyde Yards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the UK Government to build two new aircraft carriers and the positive impact that this will have for yards at Rosyth and on the Clyde; recognises that this decision is testament to the highly-skilled and committed workforce at the shipyards, and applauds the constructive approach to workplace issues, alongside robust political campaigning, undertaken by the trade unions and the workforce at the yards since privatisation.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-317</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Referendum on EU Treaty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that there should be a referendum on the proposed EU treaty currently awaiting signature by the member countries of the European Union; notes that the leaders of many of these countries have made statements which accord closely with the findings of Open Europe that the overwhelming majority of the 250 proposals in the European constitution, rejected by Dutch and French voters in referenda, remain unchanged in the revised treaty, and therefore considers that there is an unassailable case for the referendum that was promised in the event of major changes in EU sovereignty.</p>

<p>Supported by: Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Malcolm Chisholm<strong>*</strong>, John Park<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-313</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Kilsyth Health Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that there must be no delay in building the new health centre in Kilsyth, particularly in light of the recently publicised problems at the existing Airdrie Health Centre where staff and patients have to endure cramped and unsuitable conditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that any review of NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s document, <em>A Picture of Health,</em> retains the previous commitment to build the new health centre in Kilsyth.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-312</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Cumbernauld Minor Injuries Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that there must be no delay in building the new minor injuries unit in Cumbernauld and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that any review of NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s document, <em>A Picture of Health,</em> retains the previous commitment to build the new minor injuries unit in Cumbernauld town centre.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-311</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Business and Human Rights Resource Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre and the Chair of its International Advisory Network, Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, on their work; welcomes the launch of the centre&rsquo;s new website, www.business-humanrights.org, providing information about the human rights impacts, both positive and negative, of over 3,600 companies worldwide, and recognises the importance of private sector firms taking proper account of social and environmental factors in their operations and decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-310</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Scottish Civil Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports in principle the establishment of a separate Scottish civil service but believes that it is vital that regular and informal contacts continue between civil servants in Whitehall and those serving the Scottish Government and that there are good opportunities for civil servants to move between the two jurisdictions; believes that the establishment of a separate Scottish civil service should only proceed after a ministerial statement to, and approval by, the Scottish Parliament after detailed scrutiny by appropriate committees of the Parliament; calls on the First Minister to make a statement to the Parliament on the issue immediately after the summer recess, and requests that the Parliamentary Bureau establishes forthwith a Public Administration Committee with a full remit to examine the proposals and report to the Parliament on them.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-309&diams; </strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Impact of the London Olympics on Lottery Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the potentially devastating effect that the diversion of lottery funds for the 2012 Olympic Games in London will have on the Scottish voluntary sector; further notes that the announcement made by Tessa Jowell MP on 15 March 2007 proposed an increase of &pound;425 million from the Big Lottery Fund and &pound;250 million from other good causes and that the apparent focus of Whitehall is to use lottery funding to pay for budget shortcomings caused by a gross miscalculation of the costs needed to pay for the Olympics, with the current total of diverted funds at &pound;2.2 billion, up from the previous estimate of &pound;1.5 billion; pays particular attention to the fact that almost 20% of lottery funding will be top-sliced, basically a year&rsquo;s worth of funds diverted over the period from 2009 to 2012; recognises that between 2005 and 2009 the Big Lottery Fund expects to give Scotland &pound;249 million in grants and that after 2009 it will have to reassess the ability to give grants to small charities across Scotland; is aware that deprived communities in the west of Scotland, including Cunninghame North, will be among the most badly affected; observes that the Big Lottery Fund is the largest distributor of lottery funds in the United Kingdom, awarding over &pound;2.6 billion to thousands of good causes and that in 2006 alone 2934 lottery fund grants with a total value of &pound;82,366,500 were awarded; recognises that the voluntary sector has generated an estimated 10,000 jobs since 2004, employs 83,500 full-time employees in Scotland and has 1.2 million volunteers, and believes that any decrease in lottery funding will undoubtedly impact adversely on the voluntary sector and the valuable services that it provides.</p>
