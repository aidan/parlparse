          <p><strong>*S1M-3873</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: The Draft Budget 
            (Scotland) Act 2002 Amendment Order 2003</strong>-That the Finance 
            Committee, in consideration of the draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2002 
            Amendment Order 2003, recommends that the Order be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3872</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: Limited 
            Partnership Tenancies</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the reported 
            action by a number of landowners to terminate limited partnership 
            tenancies ahead of the enactment of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) 
            Bill; believes such action would be a deliberate attempt to subvert 
            the will of the Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Executive to 
            take action to backdate to September 2002 the protection provided 
            by the bill to tenants in limited partnerships.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3871#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Glasgow City 
            Council Against Pre-Emptive Attack on Iraq</strong>-That the Parliament 
            applauds the anti-war initiative of Glasgow City Council in launching 
            a petition opposed to war with Iraq; recognises the unanimous support 
            of all five political parties represented on the council for this 
            petition and the resolution passed by the council on 30 January 2003 
            which reads "The Council considers that a pre-emptive attack on Iraq 
            is neither necessary nor justified and that it would produce incalculable 
            risks to international peace and stability. The Council further considers 
            that British participation in such an attack would be likely to have 
            seriously damaging effects on Glasgow's social and economic welfare 
            and to endanger the safety of its citizens. The Council accordingly 
            calls upon Her Majesty's Government not to commit British Forces to 
            a pre-emptive attack on Iraq."; notes that the petition allows the 
            citizens of Glasgow to register their support or opposition to a war 
            led by President Bush and the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and supports 
            the council's resolution and opposes a pre-emptive attack on Iraq.<strong><em>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3870#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Forest Enterprise 
            - Location of HQ in Inverness</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            that there is a strong case for relocating public service jobs from 
            Edinburgh to rural parts of Scotland; notes that the city of Inverness 
            is being considered as one of four options for the location of the 
            headquarters of Forest Enterprise; acknowledges that Inverness is 
            already a regional office for the agency and has 44 staff who have 
            responsibility for management of around two thirds of Scotland's forests, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should support the case 
            for the headquarters of Forest Enterprise to be relocated to Inverness.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3869 Alex Neil on behalf of the Enterprise and Lifelong 
            Learning Committee: Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, <em>Report 
            on the Future of Tourism in Scotland</em></strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the 1st Report 2003 of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning 
            Committee, <em>Report on the Future of Tourism in Scotland </em>(SP 
            Paper 740), and commends the report to all stakeholders in the tourism 
            sector. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3868</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Paisley Threads</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises that running a home and being a parent is 
            a hard job on the reduced income that young people usually receive; 
            commends the support given by Barnardo's Paisley Threads to tenants 
            and parents aged 16 to 21 living in Renfrewshire to take control of 
            their lives through the pooling of information and advice on an individual 
            and group basis in an unintimidating setting; acknowledges the role 
            that Barnardo's plays in supporting 7,000 vulnerable children, young 
            people and families in Scotland each year through 54 community-based 
            services such as Paisley Threads, and realises that the short-term 
            funding for such projects can hamper consistency of service for clients 
            and their families.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3867</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Agricultural Holdings 
            (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the Agricultural 
            Holdings (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3866</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Dog Fouling 
            (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the Dog Fouling 
            (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3865</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Closure of the 
            Boots Factory in Airdrie</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its 
            deep regret at the announcement of the closure of the Boots factory 
            in Airdrie and the associated loss of almost 1000 jobs; recognises 
            the valuable role that the workforce in Airdrie has played in building 
            Boots as a company; urges all of the key agencies involved, along 
            with Boots plc, to do everything in their power to reverse this decision, 
            and, in the event of the closure going ahead, urges the Scottish Executive, 
            Scottish Enterprise and Boots to ensure that the workforce is (a) 
            given redundancy packages that recognises the excellent service that 
            it and others have provided to the company over the last 54 years 
            and (b) provided with every possible support in obtaining further 
            employment.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3864#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Location 
            of a New Hospital for Forth Valley</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            the announcement by the Forth Valley NHS Board that its favoured location 
            for a new single-site hospital for Forth Valley is the Royal Scottish 
            National hospital site at Larbert; further notes that the board is 
            to undertake further work including a feasibility study and transport 
            impact assessment before submitting its outline business case to the 
            Scottish Executive this summer; recognises that the Scottish Executive 
            and the Minister for Health and Community Care retain the ultimate 
            say over the location of the proposed new hospital for the area, and 
            believes that the Executive should consider any case for a new hospital 
            in the context of the accessibility of the hospital to the public 
            and the consequential arrangements for community health care throughout 
            the Forth Valley NHS Board area.</a></p>
