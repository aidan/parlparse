            cause of blindness in the UK, with around 650 new patients diagnosed 
            with wet AMD in Scotland every year; is deeply concerned that funding 
            has not been made available for clinicians to treat on the NHS those 
            patients who urgently require the therapy, and endorses the demand 
            by the Royal National Institute of the Blind Scotland and the Macular 
            Disease Society that the Scottish Executive ensures that funding is 
            immediately provided by all NHS boards, thereby saving the sight of 
            those who could benefit from the therapy.</p>
