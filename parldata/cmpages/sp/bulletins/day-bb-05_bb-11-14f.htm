<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&#117;
  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3560</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Stirling Students&rsquo; Support for Palestinian Right to Education Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continued occupation of Palestine by Israel and the constraints imposed by Israel upon the right to education for Palestinians; congratulates the University of Stirling Students&rsquo; Association on its recent decision to support the Palestinian Birzeit University students&rsquo; right to education campaign; further believes that there will only be peace in Palestine when there is justice for Palestinians; applauds the action of the Stirling student body in publicly expressing links of solidarity with Palestinian students in their time of need, through building a bridge of friendship between the students of Stirling and Birzeit universities, and calls on the University of Stirling to follow the students&rsquo; lead by exploring the opportunity for establishing a formal twinning relationship with Birzeit University.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3559&#117; </strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>A Full Discussion on CFP Withdrawal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the increasingly precarious state of the Scottish fishing industry, an industry so important to many communities in Fife, as well as the north east and the Highlands and Islands, and the need for full and open discussion on how to deliver a sustainable future for Scottish fisheries; recognises that withdrawal from the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is an option now supported by virtually all sectors of Scotland&rsquo;s fishing industry;&nbsp;considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate the costs and consequences of the United Kingdom initiating such a withdrawal, and believes that the Executive should include withdrawal from the CFP as an option in all further fisheries management discussions and investigations, ensuring the fullest opportunity for debating and scrutinising this alternative.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3558#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>The Tayside Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Marie Curie Cancer Care for joining forces with NHS Tayside, Dundee City Council, Perth and Kinross and Angus Councils and the Scottish Ambulance Service to deliver the first Scottish project of the Delivering Choice Programme in Tayside, which aims to look at the problems in palliative care provision in the region before developing a strategy to deliver the best possible palliative care and end-of-life care for patients in the area, allowing them to be cared for in the place of their choice; notes that Tayside has specific problems in this area, with 75% of the admissions to the cancer centre in Ninewells Hospital being for palliative care, and that over the three-year project issues like this will be tackled, and believes that the findings of the project should be utilised in other areas of Scotland to inform palliative care policy so that everyone in Scotland can benefit from this ground-breaking project.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3557</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to St Mirren Football Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the tremendous achievement of St Mirren Football Club in winning the Scottish Challenge Cup and pays tribute to Gus MacPherson and his team for bringing the cup home to Paisley; further recognises the ambitious plans of St Mirren Football Club as it makes progress towards a new stadium; wishes the team well in the First Division for the remainder of the year, and hopes that its continuing success will allow the team and stadium to grace in due course the highest heights of the Scottish Premier League.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3550</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Boost to Gaelic Language</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent agreement between Spain and the European Union which allows people who so wish to correspond with certain European Union institutions in Catalan, Galician and Basque; notes that the agreement was signed in Brussels by the Spanish Foreign Minister and the UK Foreign Secretary; considers that this offers an opportunity to place Gaelic on a similar footing, and calls on the Scottish Executive to enter into negotiations with the European Union to ensure that Gaelic is awarded the same status within Europe as Catalan, Galician and Basque.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3544</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>First Bus Puts Profits Before People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at First Bus withdrawing bus services in outlying areas of Scotland against the wishes of the local communities; notes that the withdrawal of bus services in the Twechar area, which was not communicated to the local community until the last minute, has left some people with no means to get to their work; is appalled at the arrogant attitude of First Bus management, based in Glasgow, that they do not have to provide a service on any route, that it is well within their rights to cut a service if it is not profitable and that the view of the local community is irrelevant; believes that First Bus&rsquo;s assertion in its code of business ethics that it will conduct its business &quot;with honesty, integrity and openness&quot; is an empty statement; further believes that, in future, operators&rsquo; licences should only be issued when there is a guarantee that certain bus routes within the operating area will be maintained, and notes that we are now seeing the real effect of privatisation of public transport, where bus operators are more concerned with their shareholders&rsquo; profits than providing good bus services, can cherry pick the profitable routes and, in this case, force Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) to use public money to pay for an inadequate and reduced service on the routes which First Bus has cancelled which, to add insult to injury, means that SPT is giving the money to First Bus to run these reduced services.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3542</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>Teaching of Scottish History</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern media reports that the Minister for Education and Young People, Peter Peacock, favours teaching history as part of other subjects, such as modern studies; considers that this would be a retrograde step and that, instead, the Scottish Executive should ensure that the teaching of the history of Scotland should be a specific core element of the general education of every pupil in Scottish schools; further considers that Scottish history is the retelling of the stories that shaped our nation; agrees with the view of Nigerian writer, Ben Okri, that &quot;to poison a nation, poison its stories&quot;, and considers that diluting the teaching of Scottish history or incorporating it into another subject would be to poison Scotland&rsquo;s stories.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3538</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>History Teaching in Secondary Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that far too little Scottish history is currently taught in Scottish schools and that this leaves young Scots with little or no appreciation of their heritage; further believes that this will pose grave difficulties for a future multi-cultural Scotland because a society which is not in touch with its own culture is unlikely to be able to accommodate the cultures of others, and therefore views with grave concern the Minister for Education and Young People&rsquo;s stated view that history need no longer be taught as a separate subject in the first two years of secondary schooling.</p>
