<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on  which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments  lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin  every Monday. That list also contains  any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the  Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked  with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3684 Mr Andy Kerr: Future  Arrangements for Health Services in the Argyll and Clyde Area&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament supports the decisive action announced by the Scottish Executive on  19 May 2005 to dissolve Argyll and Clyde NHS Board and to redraw the boundaries  of the neighbouring boards to take over its responsibilities from April 2006;  believes that these steps will address the board&rsquo;s structural and financial  problems; applauds the continued successful efforts of staff in NHS Argyll and  Clyde to maintain comprehensive healthcare services for the people of the area;  notes that a full public consultation has been held on the boundary option to  be adopted, and supports NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow in their task of  returning services to financial balance while maintaining high standards of  quality and access.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3682 Rob Gibson: Caithness Maternity Saved!&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the successful,  persistent and popular campaign by the North Action Group to secure  consultant-led maternity services in Wick that can now serve the people of  Caithness and north Sutherland for the foreseeable future; notes the role of  the Kerr report which seeks to establish a workplan that contributes to the  recently accepted national priority of sustaining rural general hospitals;  wishes the board of NHS Highland success in seeking to recruit three permanent  consultant obstetricians to be based in Caithness; welcomes the aim of catering  for the work needs of clinicians&rsquo; partners; notes that the communities&rsquo; wishes  will be met by the appointment of these consultants to back up a midwife team  whose task is to provide quality services that are women and family-centred,  essentially community-based and midwife-managed while demonstrating a shared  philosophy of care irrespective of risk, and hopes that this will encourage  young families to remain in the far north and attract more economically active  people to choose to live and work there.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3670.2 Christine Grahame: Violence  Against Women&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3670) in the name of Malcolm  Chisholm, insert at end &ldquo;, and further, in challenging the attitudes which  place the blame on the woman and not the perpetrator, condemns the overt  sexualised representation of young women prevailing in a range of publications,  electronic or paper, driven by commercialism, which presents women as objects  rather than individuals.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3670.3 Frances Curran: Violence  Against Women&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3670) in the name of Malcolm  Chisholm, insert at end &ldquo;recognises that the normalisation of sexualised images  of women and girls in magazines that are on general sale promotes sexist  attitudes about women and girls and contributes to ideas that allow violence  towards women to occur without challenge, and further recognises that the  Violence Against Women Fund is grant allocated and that mainstream funding is  still not a reality for many non-governmental organisations, local authorities  and the NHS and therefore that violence against women initiatives are treated  as fringe activities as opposed to core strategic planning.&rdquo;</p>
