          <p><strong>*S2M-503</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>British 
            Baker of the Year - Brownings the Bakers Kilmarnock</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates Brownings the Bakers, Kilmarnock in being 
            the first Scottish company to be awarded the British Baker of the 
            Year award.</P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-502#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade</strong>-That 
            the Parliament warmly welcomes moves by the City of Edinburgh Council 
            to endorse the Fairtrade Towns Initiative supported by organisations 
            including Oxfam, the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development, Traidcraft 
            and the World Development Movement; pays tribute to the Fairtrade 
            Foundation that exists to ensure a better deal for marginalised and 
            disadvantaged producers in developing countries and to ensure that 
            products marked with the Fairtrade logo meet internationally recognised 
            standards of Fairtrade, and acknowledges the commitment of local authorities, 
            churches, schools and universities across Scotland that are working 
            towards achieving the Fairtrade mark.<FONT COLOR="#0000ff">&nbsp;</font></P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-501</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Unauthorised 
            GM Material in Crop Trials</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the results of the Scottish Agriculture Science Agency's GM 
            Inspectorate's investigation into the GM seed used in the latest round 
            of farm scale trials in Scotland, which revealed that approximately 
            5.5% of material planted was genetically modified seed not authorised 
            under the terms of the release consent for the trials; welcomes the 
            investigation by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment 
            into recommendations for improvements to the inspection and enforcement 
            systems in place; further welcomes the referral of this case by the 
            Scottish Executive to the Procurator Fiscal, and believes that since 
            some GM seedlot suppliers are unable to provide the necessary level 
            of biosecurity for the field trials, they should not be involved in 
            commercial planting and therefore calls on the Executive to refuse 
            any further licences for the planting of genetically modified material, 
            for either field trials or commercial purposes.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-500</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Nature 
            Conservation (Scotland) Bill - Financial Resolution</strong>-That 
            the Parliament, for the purposes of any act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Bill, agrees to 
            any increase in expenditure payable out of the Scottish Consolidated 
            Fund in consequence of the act.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-499</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Renewable 
            Energy</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the concerns of members 
            of the public over the inappropriate siting of on-shore wind farms; 
            notes that Scotland potentially has many various forms of renewable 
            energy; calls on the Scottish Executive to establish a publicly-owned 
            renewable energy company that would encompass all forms of renewable 
            energy, and further calls on the Executive to take the national grid 
            into public ownership to facilitate the efficient transfer of electricity.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-498#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>State 
            Aid to Scottish Industry</strong>-That the Parliament believes that 
            Her Majesty's Government should step up state aid to Scottish industry 
            to the European Union average in an attempt to protect Scottish jobs.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-497#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Tendering 
            of Caledonian MacBrayne Ferry Services</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should immediately end the tendering 
            process for Caledonian MacBrayne ferry services in light of the European 
            Court of Justice's ruling on the Altmark Trans bus company case.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-496</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Football Team and Euro 2004</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Scottish football team on reaching the play-off stages of the 
            UEFA Euro 2004 tournament; notes the magnificent contribution made 
            by Midlothian's own Darren Fletcher to the team's success, and wishes 
            the entire squad the best of luck for the play-off against the Netherlands.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-495#</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>West 
            of Scotland *Secure* Care Centre</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should instruct a review of the screening 
            and shortlisting processes conducted by the West of Scotland Forensic 
            Steering Group in relation to the proposed construction of a secure 
            care centre to ensure that the declared selection criteria has been 
            applied equally in all the original 27 proposed sites, and notes the 
            concerns of many residents in the Renfrewshire area due to inaccuracies 
            in relation to the screening and shortlisting processes applied to 
            the Dykebar Hospital Paisley site.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-474*#*</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Horse 
            Racing Industry in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the significant contribution that the horse racing industry makes 
            to the economy, generating up to £125 million annually and providing 
            the equivalent of 1700 full-time jobs; commends the success of the 
            racing industry in continuing to expand and develop, recognising its 
            contribution to local economies and tourism; notes that there is widespread 
            concern regarding the potential implications of the proposed Office 
            of Fair Trading (OFT) rule 14 notice on the deregulation of the British 
            horse racing industry and, in particular, on its likely impact on 
            Scotland's five racecourses, Ayr, Hamilton Park, Kelso, Musselburgh 
            and Perth, each of which is independently owned and managed with profits 
            generated ploughed back into the sport for long-term growth, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should work with representatives of the 
            racing industry to identify opportunities to promote and develop the 
            industry and to explore the possible implications of the OFT ruling.</P>
