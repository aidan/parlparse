<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5198</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Child Fuel Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the calculation by Barnardo&rsquo;s, Capability Scotland, the Child Poverty Action Group, Children in Scotland and Save the Children that there are now 100,000 Scottish children living in fuel poverty; understands that this is a result of massive and sustained increases in energy prices which have overwhelmed the benefits from increases in income and Scottish Executive and local authority programmes on energy efficiency; believes that the recent advice from npower that parents should send their children to bed wearing socks and a hat represents an entirely inadequate response to the worsening situation for vulnerable families, and looks forward to the energy companies accepting the case for discounted tariffs for vulnerable households.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5197</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Attack on Sikh Youth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the unprovoked attack on a Sikh youth in Pilrig Park last week; expresses its solidarity with those who took part in a prayer vigil to express the community&rsquo;s support for the victim and to condemn the thuggery involved in the attack; condemns the racist thugs who carried out the attack, and, given the attacks on the cars of members of the Leith Sikh community earlier this year, calls on Lothian and Borders Police to thoroughly investigate whether organised racists are active in the Leith area.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5196</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>HMRC Rationalisation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disappointed by the recent announcement from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenues and Customs (HMRC) concerning the rationalisation of work which will result in up to 90 civil service jobs leaving Dundee; is disappointed by the way in which the announcement was communicated to workers and their union representatives; calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Westminster to urge the reversal of the decision to centralise work and cut jobs, and agrees with the PCS union that if further job losses occur they will render the HMRC unfit for purpose.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5195</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Scottish Football Association Hall of Fame</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the inclusion to the Scottish Football Association (SFA) Hall of Fame of players from other countries who have made an outstanding contribution to Scottish football but regrets the exclusion of some outstanding Scottish players such as Eric Caldow, who captained both Scotland and Rangers, and who, while captaining Scotland for his 40th cap at Wembley, tragically suffered a leg fracture which effectively ended his Scotland career; recognises that Eric Caldow also won 12 Scottish League caps, 5 Scottish League Championship Medals, 2 Scottish Cup Medals and 3 Scottish League Cup Medals; notes his exemplary record of fair play by being one of the few long-serving players who played in the tough atmosphere of Scottish football at that time but was never booked by a referee, and believes, therefore, that Eric Caldow should be included in the SFA Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Supported by: Phil Gallie<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5194</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Caring Christmas Trees Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the work and aims of Bethany Christian Trust&rsquo;s &quot;Caring Christmas Trees&quot; initiative, which raises money for Bethany&rsquo;s Care Shelter through selling Christmas trees; notes that the funds provide food, shelter and advice to hundreds of people who would otherwise be sleeping rough during the winter and congratulates all the workers and volunteers who make the initiative possible; notes that the initiative is reliant on volunteers, and calls on MSPs to lead by example by purchasing a tree from Caring Christmas Trees and volunteering four hours of their time to help run one of the Caring Christmas Trees depots in Edinburgh or Fife.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5193</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Milton Friedman</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its sadness at the death of Professor Milton Friedman on 16 November 2006, aged 94; recognises that he was the most influential economist of his generation, was a Nobel Prize winner and left a legacy of influential works; celebrates him for creating monetarism, which formed the foundation for the governments of Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan in the United States of America, resulting in stronger economies and greater prosperity, and thanks him for being the founder of modern monetary policy and a strong activist for capitalism and individual freedom.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5192&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Time for Real Debate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that, while Scottish Power has increased profits by a staggering 77% to &pound;483 million, customers have seen bills rise by an incredible 95% for gas and 50% for electricity over the last three years, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of people living in fuel-poor homes and adding further misery and hardship to many deprived areas, especially in Glasgow; contrasts this with Scottish Water&rsquo;s recent accolade from the Water Industry Commission for Scotland whose cost and performance report states &quot;Determined management is generating real benefits for customers. At the same time as it has lowered costs, it has improved service and achieved better quality and environmental standards&quot;, and believes that there should be a mature, modern and considered debate, without the usual dogmatic arguments, on the whole issue of private and state ownership.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5191#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>BP Fails the People of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Fife Constabulary for its test purchasing of alcohol initiative at the BP garage in Dalgety Bay; applauds the efforts of Fife Police in undertaking this work in its efforts to identify retailers who sell to under-age drinkers; recognises the distress of local families who have been seriously affected by the impact of under-age drinkers in the town; further recognises that there is rising public and political alarm at increased alcohol consumption, especially in respect of under-age drinkers, binge drinking and public disorder and violence; notes that alcohol has recently been designated by the World Health Organization as a major global determinant of ill-health, with alcohol-related problems representing about 9% of the disease burden in Europe;  further notes that the societal cost of alcohol abuse is colossal, exceeding &pound;20 billion annually in the United Kingdom, to say nothing of the cost of family and social disruption, criminality and ill health; notes with dismay and condemns the actions of BP in failing to train and support its local outlet staff appropriately and further failing to support Fife Constabulary in this groundbreaking initiative, and hopes that all car users in the country will note the actions of BP when deciding which supplier of petrol to use.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5190</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Seasonal Cheer - End Child Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament extends its full support to the &quot;End Child Poverty&quot; campaign being launched by Save the Children in which they highlight the fact that thousands of Scottish children are missing out on the basics of a healthy, happy childhood, especially at this expensive time of the year, and fully endorses Save the Children&rsquo;s call for the Scottish Executive to prioritise the needs of the poorest children and to work with the UK Government to implement a child seasonal grant for the benefit of the poorest families at the most expensive times of year, especially during the winter.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5172*#*</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Ending Child Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that it is unacceptable that children living in severe poverty in Scotland are missing out on basic necessities such as fresh, nutritious food, new clothes and shoes and having a warm home in the winter; welcomes Save the Children&rsquo;s campaign to end child poverty, which highlights the effects for children and their families of living in severe and persistent poverty; acknowledges the progress made by the Scottish Executive in lifting 100,000 children in Scotland out of poverty and helping children in the Dumbarton constituency and across Scotland to improve their life chances, and believes that more needs to be done and that the Executive should prioritise the needs of the very poorest children and continue to work with the UK Government in implementing solutions, such as child seasonal grants, proposed as part of the Save the Children campaign.</p>
