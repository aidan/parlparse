          <p>9.30 am&#9;Ministerial Statement on Prison Estates</p>
          <p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Debate on The Scottish Fuel Poverty Statement- 
          </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3350</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Fuel Poverty Statement</strong>-That the Parliament commends the Scottish 
            Executive for its Fuel Poverty Statement and its pledge to work in 
            partnership with Her Majesty's Government at Westminster and a range 
            of organisations; welcomes the milestones for achieving its overall 
            objective to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that people 
            are not living in fuel poverty by November 2016; recognises the substantial 
            investment that is being made in the Central Heating Programme and 
            the Warm Deal and in improving Scotland's housing stock, and further 
            recognises that the Statement affirms the Executive's commitment to 
            tackling fuel poverty and meeting its objective. </p>
          <blockquote>

              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-3350.2</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Scottish 
                Fuel Poverty Statement</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3350) 
                in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; 
                to end and insert &quot;welcomes the publication of the Fuel Poverty 
                Statement and the positive developments contained within it; accepts 
                the need for a single entry point to the plethora of grant schemes 
                and initiatives available; believes that, to eliminate fuel poverty, 
                resources both human and financial must be in place to meet this 
                aim; urges the Scottish Executive to extend the Warm Deal and 
                Central Heating Programme to disabled people, the long-term sick 
                and all pensioners with partial or obsolete systems at the earliest 
                possible opportunity; considers the establishment of a Decent 
                Homes Standard as fundamental to reducing fuel poverty, not least 
                through energy efficiency measures; has serious concerns regarding 
                hard to heat homes, the inflexible application of criteria used 
                in the Central Heating Programme, the delay in installing central 
                heating in Glasgow's socially rented sector and the Executive's 
                definition of fuel poverty, and seeks the commitment of the Executive 
                to liaise with Her Majesty's Government on issues such as debt 
                blocking, pre-payment meters and benefit uptake&quot;.</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-3350.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Scottish Fuel 
                Poverty Statement</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3350) 
                in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from the first &quot;recognises&quot; 
                to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Executive's 
                self-congratulation is unfounded given that substantial inroads 
                into eradicating fuel poverty were made by previous Conservative 
                governments, and recognises that the policies of those Conservative 
                governments have had a lasting effect and that many of them have 
                been continued by the Scottish Executive under a different name.&quot;
