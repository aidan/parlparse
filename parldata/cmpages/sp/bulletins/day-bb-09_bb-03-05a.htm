<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Scottish Government Failures&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3609</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government Failures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that SNP manifesto promises have been broken on a wide range of issues including health, housing, community safety and education; further notes the absence of a credible strategy to address the needs of people facing difficult economic circumstances and to tackle poverty and disadvantage; regrets that the Scottish Government prefers to focus its attention on the powers it does not have in order to pursue its party&rsquo;s agenda of separation, and urges the Scottish Government to examine how it might effectively use the powers at its disposal to meet the needs of people by sustaining economic activity and employment and supporting communities across Scotland. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3609.3</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish Government Failures</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3609) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;commends the Scottish Government&rsquo;s record of achievement since May 2007; believes that the benefits to the Scottish people of lower council tax bills, lower business rates, lower prescription charges and a return to free education are reflected in the SNP&rsquo;s excellent poll ratings; notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s&nbsp;six-point economic recovery plan that is providing much-needed assistance during Labour&rsquo;s recession; believes, however, that additional economic powers for the Scottish Parliament, in particular borrowing powers, are essential to steer the Scottish economy out of recession and thereafter to support economic growth; condemns the &pound;500 million in&nbsp;cuts that the UK Labour government plans to impose on the Scottish budget in 2010-11 and 2011-12, which&nbsp;will cost more than 8,000 jobs and represents a serious threat to economic recovery; calls on all parties with Scotland&rsquo;s interests at heart to oppose these cuts, and looks forward to continuing a lively debate and National Conversation about Scotland&rsquo;s future.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3609.1</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles: Scottish Government Failures</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3609) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish Government to concentrate its efforts on economic recovery and abandon its divisive plans for a Referendum Bill for the remainder of its term of office.&quot;</p>
