    collapse of an earth-mound; further notes that in the opinion of the mining company

    believes that the current national planning policy guidelines which stipulate a minimum
    distance of 500 metres between opencast workings and housing settlements is completely
    unsatisfactory and does not protect the safety of the public, and therefore calls upon the

    that Diageo, as the multi-national company which took over Distillers, which originally

    around 400 staff hours a day wasted away from essential rehabilitation work with prisoners
