<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5546</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Justice for the Shrewsbury 24</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent launch of a campaign to secure justice for the 24 construction workers charged with conspiracy during the 1972 building workers&rsquo; strike who many believe were viciously victimised; further notes that the Shrewsbury 24, as they become known, were taking part in a legal and legitimate official strike when they were arrested and charged, with six men receiving harsh gaol sentences and the 18 others being branded criminals for life and receiving two year suspended sentences; condemns the brutal treatment meted out by the establishment against these workers whose only &quot;crime&quot; was to oppose the exploitative use of &quot;cash-in-hand&quot; employment and the lack of health and safety practices afforded to workers in the construction industry; salutes the courage of the Shrewsbury 24 for standing up for workers&rsquo; rights despite the intimidation of the employers and the state and demands that the conviction of these men be immediately quashed and a terrible wrong be addressed 34 years after the convictions which relied upon an 1875 law on unlawful assembly; notes with concern the recent comments of Terry Renshaw, one of the Shrewsbury 24, when he said &quot;despite our fight for proper protection for workers, which cost us so highly, the death rate on construction sites, the highest in any industry, remains the same today as it was 34 years ago&quot;; supports the Justice for the Shrewsbury 24 Campaign, and demands greater safety conditions for all construction workers.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5545#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Happy 150th Birthday to the Greenock Telegraph</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the <em>Greenock Telegraph </em>on its 150th birthday which it will celebrate on 18 March 2007; notes that over the past century and a half this daily evening paper has become a valued institution in Greenock and throughout Inverclyde; further notes that, despite the challenges posed by new media, it continues to enjoy a wide and dedicated readership; pays tribute to the past and present editors, journalists, photographers, advertising sales staff, administrators and everyone else whose hard work is essential in continuing to bring local news and sport to the people of Greenock and Inverclyde, and wishes the &quot;Tele&quot; all the very best for its next 150 years.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5544</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Support for the Bolivarian Socialist Republic of Venezuela</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of the democratically elected National Assembly of Venezuela to approve a wide-ranging enabling law to allow the re-elected President, Hugo Chavez, to nationalise key sectors of the Venezuelan economy to facilitate the growth of socialist production and wealth redistribution across Venezuela; further notes that the power to nationalise will target important sectors like oil, telecommunications, electricity and natural gas and notes the comments of Hugo Chavez that &quot;The nationalisations will always be limited to strategic areas of the economy&hellip;I call to national and international business owners to come. Let&rsquo;s work together for the development of a mixed economic model&quot;, and believes that a mixed economic socialist model with ownership and control of the key sectors of the economy in public hands would well serve an independent Scotland in respect of both the quality and standard of the life of all its citizens.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5543</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Troops Out of Iraq: Don&rsquo;t Attack Iran</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the growing, bloody and brutal carnage in Iraq which claims thousands of innocent lives each week; believes that the continued presence of what many consider to be illegally occupying US and UK troops is a major factor in the bloody conflict engulfing Iraq and is not part of the solution; supports the worldwide calls, including from the overwhelming majority of Iraqi citizens according to several opinion polls, to withdraw UK and US troops immediately as a first serious step towards stability and genuine recovery within Iraq; welcomes the Stop the War conference to be held in Glasgow on Saturday 10 February 2007 and the Bin the Bomb rally to be held, also in Glasgow, two weeks later on 24 February; opposes any plans to attack Iran, and believes that the British Prime Minister and Gordon Brown, the current Chancellor of the Exchequer, should issue unequivocal statements now denouncing US neo-con plans to bomb Iran in recognition of the fact that such acts of state terrorism would cause untold misery, suffering and war across the Middle East and the globe.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5542</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Equal Treatment for Expatriate Pensioners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/712), laid before the Westminster Parliament in March 2006, excluded expatriate pensioners living in countries not covered by reciprocal social security arrangements with the United Kingdom from having their state pensions up-rated in the same way as those living in the UK; further notes that the cost of including these pensioners in the annual up-rating order for 2005-06 would have been just &pound;20 million; condemns this penny-pinching approach to pensioners who have paid many years of national insurance contributions before emigrating, and calls on the Westminster Government to restore these pensioners&rsquo; right to equal treatment with pensioners resident in the UK.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5541</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>The Non-Domestic Rate (Scotland) Order 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Transport Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Non-Domestic Rate (Scotland) Order 2007 (SSI 2007/2).</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5540</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Kintore Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposal to reopen Kintore station as a medium-term priority within the Nestrans Aberdeen Crossrail project; notes that there is strong local support for the reopening of the train station; further notes that Kintore&rsquo;s population has grown over the last five years from around 1,600 to over 2,500 today; further notes that the reopening of Kintore station would provide an integrated transport service for the Garioch area and would also help to reduce traffic congestion on local roads as well as being more environmentally friendly, and calls on Transport Scotland, the Scottish Executive and Nestrans to work towards the reopening of the station at the earliest possible time as a strategic part of enhanced rail provision.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5539</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Recognition for the Work of the Holocaust Educational Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and applauds the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust in teaching young people about the Holocaust; notes that the trust is committed to ensuring that our young people understand the horror of the Holocaust and how vital it is to fight hatred whenever and wherever it arises; further notes this year&rsquo;s theme, &quot;The Dignity of Difference&quot;, encouraging commemorations to reflect on the different groups that were persecuted and murdered during the Holocaust, as well as in more recent incidents of prejudice, discrimination and genocide, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support all schools to allow them to take advantage of the trust&rsquo;s outreach programme which sends educators and Holocaust survivors into schools to deliver innovative, interactive workshops that teach about the Holocaust and its lessons for future generations.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5538</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Maintenance Contracts for Senior Citizens&rsquo; Central Heating Systems</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that maintenance contracts for central heating systems installed under the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s excellent central heating programme currently cost pensioner households in excess of &pound;200 per annum; recognises that, while this provides peace of mind that their central heating systems are being maintained, it cancels out the benefit of their &pound;200 winter heating allowance, and considers that a 50% reduction in the cost of these maintainance contracts would be of great benefit to hard-pressed senior citizens.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5537</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Fatal Accident at Delny Level Crossing, Ross-shire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the fatal accident which occurred at the Delny level crossing in Ross-shire on 2 February 2007; notes also the long standing concerns about the safety of the barrier-less crossings on the Far North and Kyle railway lines, and urges the Scottish Executive to consider how safety at these crossings could be improved.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5535</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Forth and Tay Road Bridges Tolls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the tolls should be removed from the Forth Road Bridge and the Tay Road Bridge.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Shona Robison<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5525*#*</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Switch Off Energy Debt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the high level of energy debt in Scotland; notes from the most recent figures published by Ofgem that 343,617 customers in Dunfermline and elsewhere owe their energy supplier an average of &pound;181; further notes that energy prices remain high, with Scottish consumers typically paying more than &pound;1,000 per year for their gas and electricity; is concerned that, according to Ofgem, the number of disconnections from energy supply has risen by 285% between September 2005 and September 2006, and believes that all energy suppliers should take urgent action to address the burden of debt on Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable households.</p>
