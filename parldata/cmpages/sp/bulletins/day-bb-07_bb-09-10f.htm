          <p><strong>*S3M-435</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen&rsquo;s Bid to Host the World Petroleum Congress in 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its full support to Aberdeen&rsquo;s bid to host the World Petroleum Congress in 2011 and calls on the Scottish Government and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to do everything possible to ensure that the bid by the energy capital of Europe is successful.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-434&diams; </strong> <strong>Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Unidentified, Unprotected</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication on 13 August 2007 of the letters of assurance correspondence between the Scottish Executive and local authorities, including Inverclyde Council; notes that this reveals that the authorities are unable to identify, far less provide services for, children in their areas living with parental drug misuse; acknowledges that, if authorities do not know who or where these children are, they cannot provide them with the services they need and which the Executive strategy, Hidden Harm - Next Steps: Supporting Children &ndash; Working with Parents, states that they should receive at an early stage, and therefore believes that local authorities and agencies should be given every possible assistance to meet the obligations that they are currently not fulfilling before there is another needless and preventable loss of life.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-433#</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>The Cruiser Varyag</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the ceremony attended by senior Russian politicians, navy personnel and veterans to remember and commemorate the famous Russian Cruiser, Varyag, which lies off the coast of Lendalfoot, South Ayrshire; welcomes the many Russian visitors who attended the events to mark this important occasion for the Russian nation, including the officers and crew members of the Russian naval vessel, Severomorsk, which has been moored off the Ayrshire coast as part of the celebration; recognises the significant work locally by individuals and organisations that has helped to develop this event over the last two years, most notably by Girvan Horizons and South Ayrshire Council; thanks the people of Lendalfoot and South Carrick for the warm welcome they have given to the many Russian visitors who come to the Varyag memorial, and hopes that this event will continue to grow in stature and prominence over the coming years and serve to strengthen and develop the links of friendship and comradeship between the people of Scotland and Russia.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-432</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Affordable Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the difficulty that first-time buyers have entering the housing market and calls on the Scottish Government to examine the feasibility and implications of introducing an across-the-board open bids or fixed price system for the sale of housing property in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-431</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Renfrewshire Libraries Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Renfrewshire Council on winning for Scotland the Hidden Treasures Brought to Life competition, held by the British Library, for the Arbuthnott Manuscripts, a 15th century missal described as being unique, visually appealing and of historical value; recognises the diverse and comprehensive services offered by the libraries service of Renfrewshire Council, and wishes it continued success in the future.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-429</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>QE2</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the visit of the QE2 to the River Clyde on 20 September 2007; further notes that the QE2 was built by John Brown&rsquo;s shipyard in Clydebank 40 years ago; welcomes the invitation extended by Cunard to the men who built the vessel to board the ship one last time; notes with concern that many of those who built the QE2 are no longer alive, due to asbestos-related diseases resulting from less secure work and safety practices in the shipbuilding industry at that time, and calls on Cunard to consider a more generous gesture to the surviving men and the families of men who are no longer alive.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-428</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Electric Training Devices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the sale and use of electric training devices to train and control dogs, with the exception of electric fences which operate on a different principle; considers the use of such devices to be cruel and unnecessary; understands that positive training methods train dogs more quickly and reliably; recognises that, because dogs have a strong bond with humans, their natural instincts can be utilised to train them easily, and believes that the Scottish Government should consider the introduction of a complete ban on the sale and use of electric training devices at the earliest  possible opportunity.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-427&diams;</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>World Alzheimer&rsquo;s Day - 21 September 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses support for World Alzheimer&rsquo;s Day on Friday 21 September 2007 as an occasion when Alzheimer Scotland, alongside Alzheimer&rsquo;s organisations across the globe, concentrates its efforts in raising awareness of dementia; notes that there are an estimated 24 million people around the world who currently have dementia and around 62,000 people living with dementia in Scotland today; acknowledges that it is important to raise awareness of dementia as an illness and campaign to reduce the misunderstandings and stigma that exist about the condition; recognises the importance of advocacy for this vulnerable group; further acknowledges that maintaining current levels of service provision will not be an option due to the projected increase in the number of people with dementia in Scotland, which is expected to rise by 75% in under 25 years to around 108,000 by 2031, and therefore recognises that improvements to services must be made to promote the highest standards of health and community care.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-426</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>World&rsquo;s Biggest Coffee Morning - Friday 28 September 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the efforts of Macmillan Cancer Support in organising the World&rsquo;s Biggest Coffee Morning which will take place this year on Friday 28 September; notes that last year over &pound;650,000 was raised in Scotland alone, and recognises that, while everybody is invited by Glasgow SNP list MSPs, Bob Doris, Sandra White, Bashir Ahmad and Bill Kidd, to attend a special coffee morning between 10.30 am and 11.30 am in rooms 329-332, Baltic Chambers, 50 Wellington Street, Glasgow, other members may find it logistically easier to organise an event in their own areas to support this very worthwhile cause.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-425#</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Bog Myrtle (Sweet Gale) Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the potential for the bog myrtle (sweet gale) industry in the Highlands and Scotland; considers that support should be accelerated for the industry, which sees bog myrtle grow wild and be cultivated on plantations across the Highlands, and is soon to be expanded to other regions including Moray, Aberdeenshire and the Borders; notes that immediate support is necessary to establish development, planting and research study which will ensure that the industry develops quickly and that crofters, farmers and landowners involved in the production of bog myrtle see an immediate effect, and believes that support should be given to the commercial planting programme to help mitigate the risk undertaken by initial growers to establish crops in order to see the production of bog myrtle increase in the Highlands and establish the crop in other parts of Scotland in an effort to meet the anticipated global demand for this plant from the healthcare industry and drinks manufacturers and ensure that the subsequent planting by growers continues on a sustained basis.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-424#</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Sale of Freescale Semiconductor Plant at East Kilbride</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement that, after months of public speculation, the US electronics company, Freescale Semiconductor, is to end production at its East Kilbride plant, where it currently employs about 900 skilled staff; regrets this blow to the electronics sector in central Scotland, and hopes that the engagement of an international real estate consultancy by Freescale will result in a buyer being found who can provide continuing employment for this highly-skilled workforce and continuing use of the specialised equipment and processes used in the plant at East Kilbride.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-421</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Antonine Wall World Heritage Site</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes to Scotland UNESCO representatives judging the Antonine Wall&rsquo;s bid to win World Heritage status; notes that Scotland already has four world heritage sites, recognised across the world and of significant importance to Scotland in cultural and economic terms; recognises that tourism is Scotland&rsquo;s biggest industry and that the majority of visitors from overseas visit a historic site during their stay; believes that the inclusion of the Antonine Wall in the list of Scotland&rsquo;s world heritage sites would boost tourism across the central belt, from the Kinneil fortlet at Bo&rsquo;ness on the River Forth, through Callendar Park, Bonnybridge, Castlecary, Croy Hill, Twechar and Bearsden, to the fort site and rampart base at Duntocher, and hopes that the bid is successful to help preserve the most northerly boundary of the Roman Empire for generations to come.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-421.1</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Antonine Wall World Heritage Site</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-421) in the name of Cathie Craigie, insert at end &quot;however, notes that Scotland&rsquo;s Roman heritage also includes the Gask Ridge, first constructed by Agricola in the 80s AD, a Roman frontier system extending from the Antonine Wall at Camelon near Falkirk to Bertha near Perth and comprising a roadway along which were built forts and watchtowers of which the most complete is the Ardoch Fort at Braco, and recommends that this continuation of Roman fortifications in Scotland is also worthy of being included in the application for World Heritage Status.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-420#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Muscular Dystrophy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that there are 3,000 people living in Scotland with inherited neuromuscular disorders and muscular dystrophy; is concerned that families in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and across Scotland still experience lengthy waits for powered wheelchairs and home adaptations a year after the My Life campaign; recognises that means-testing for adaptations for disabled children has been abolished in England and Wales but not in Scotland; notes that England and Wales has a dedicated fund, the Disabled Facilities Grant, that can award up to &pound;25,000 for adaptations; further notes that the equivalent fund in Scotland, the Housing Adaptation Grant, serves other non-disability related adaptations, is not a ring-fenced fund and is capped at &pound;20,000, and considers it imperative that these organisational and financial failures in providing necessary support to enable people to live independently are addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-413</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Scottish Commercial Shipbuilding Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets and deplores the near extinction of the Scottish commercial shipbuilding industry; is acutely aware that this once great industry is represented only by Ferguson of Port Glasgow, a yard currently without orders and with a skeleton workforce; knows that this lamentable state of affairs stands in stark contrast to other European shipbuilding nations where many shipyards are enjoying remarkable levels of demand for all kinds of new vessels, which will take them beyond 2010; notes that in the past year the Northern Lighthouse Board took delivery of a new tender built in a Polish yard, Caledonian MacBrayne acquired a new ferry, also from Poland, and the Craig Group of Aberdeen accepted the latest of nine supply vessels from a yard in Spain; compares these orders for vessels which will operate in Scottish waters with the recent strange decision to defer the awarding of a new contract for a new fisheries protection vessel; believes that successive industrial and political leaders have failed this important maritime sector but is still of the view that commercial shipbuilding can maintain a niche on the Clyde, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive, ship owners, the managers of publicly funded fleets of vessels and other appropriate interested parties to do all that they can to retain this sector of our shipbuilding industry.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-411</strong> <strong>Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Raith Interchange</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the call by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport to designate Raith Interchange a strategic priority given the economic contribution it is forecast to make and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward the start date of work on the interchange.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-410</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>ICL/Stockline Disaster Report: Equity Fines</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the authors of the recently published document, <em>The ICL/Stockline Disaster: An Independent Report on Working Conditions prior to the Explosion</em>; notes, in particular, the mention of the equity fines system developed by lawyers in the United States of America, a system that punishes those who benefit the most from corporate offending, owners and shareholders, and avoids the redistribution of corporate punishments to the most vulnerable groups, such as employees, and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate the feasibility of incorporating this and other aspects of the report into Scottish law.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-273#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>MacMillan Cancer Support&rsquo;s Recovered but not Covered Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the extortionate premiums charged by many travel insurance firms to cancer patients or persons with a history of cancer treatment, which often lead to their travel insurance prices being considerably higher than journey costs; acknowledges that this problem will worsen with growing numbers of people diagnosed with cancer and living longer who want or need to travel; recognises its impact on patients and their families in Aberdeen North and elsewhere in Scotland; furthermore supports MacMillan Cancer Support&rsquo;s Recovered but not Covered campaign which seeks to make it easier for people affected by cancer to get fair travel insurance prices, and welcomes joint research between MacMillan and the Royal Bank of Scotland to investigate how cancer sufferers can obtain fairer travel insurance, but considers that these discriminatory and insensitive charges should be ended by other insurance companies.</p>
