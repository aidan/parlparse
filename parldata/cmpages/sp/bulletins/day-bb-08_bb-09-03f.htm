<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2475</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Hospital Car Parking Charges Abolished</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Scottish Government to abolish car parking charges at NHS hospitals across Scotland; notes that these charges have been criticised by members of all political parties as a tax on the sick and believes that this decision reaffirming the founding principles of the NHS, namely that it should be free at the point of delivery, is one that should be welcomed across the political spectrum.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2474</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Scots Language Centre and Scottish National Dictionaries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the support given to the Scots language by the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture in January 2008 when she stated that it &quot;is part of our identity and our heritage as a nation. We must encourage confidence in the use of Scots in all its forms and create opportunities for it to thrive&quot; and that our national languages &quot;should be as valued as any other language spoken in the world&quot;; welcomes this clear statement of support for the Scots language and all related languages, which reflect the rich and varied linguistic heritage found in Scotland from Shetland to Galloway; recognises the important work carried out by the Scots Language Centre and Scottish National Dictionaries in supporting the Scots language; views with concern the threat to the work of these two important bodies from the proposed cut to their funding by the Scottish Arts Council, and believes that their funding should be maintained so that they can continue to help to deliver the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to the Scots language.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2473</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>East Dunbartonshire&rsquo;s Elite Performers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the 11 local athletes who have been supported by East Dunbartonshire Council&rsquo;s 2008 Elite Performer Support Programme; notes that grants totalling &pound;7,250 this year will assist young athletes in East Dunbartonshire who have a chance of reaching the London Olympics in 2012, and further acknowledges the commitment of East Dunbartonshire Council in awarding &pound;10,000 per year until 2011 to support the best in their sports in East Dunbartonshire.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2472#</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Sailing and Boating Continues to Expand and Contribute to the Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that sailing and boating continues to expand as an industry bringing substantial benefits to the economy and offering people jobs; notes that there are some 250,000 yachts in the United Kingdom, of which 15,000 are currently resident in Scotland and that, of these, approximately 5,000 are based on the River Clyde, with 3,000 in marinas and 2,000 on moorings in the Clyde; further notes that the leisure marine industry turnover in Scotland is &pound;98.9 million per annum, that the industry employs 1,816 full-time equivalents in Scotland and supports 7,900 jobs and that the economic benefit of recreational boating in Scotland is estimated to be in excess of &pound;250 million; acknowledges that further marina development is scheduled throughout Scotland with proposals for marinas in Greenock that would further enhance the reputation of sailing on the west coast; congratulates everyone connected with recreational sailing and boating for this economic success, and looks forward to even more economic delivery in the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2456</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of the Comments of Andrew Lansley and Defence of the NHS in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on Conservative UK Shadow Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley MP, to withdraw his comments suggesting that health spending should be reduced in Glasgow and spent elsewhere in the United Kingdom; believes that Mr Lansley&rsquo;s apparent conclusion that health spending is inverse to health outcomes and should therefore be reduced in areas of poor health is a perverse logic that risks denying people in most need the healthcare that they require and deserve and that this is an alarming indication of the Conservatives&rsquo; intention to cut NHS funding; notes with equal concern that Mr Lansley&rsquo;s wish may already be being granted by the SNP government in light of the recently announced &pound;42 million of cuts to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the fact that health spending in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget fails to match the year-on-year increases of both the UK Government for England and those of the previous Scottish administration; further notes that, if this trend continues, Scotland&rsquo;s historically higher health spending per head of population is at risk of being reversed within the next five years, and calls on members of all parties to defend the NHS in Scotland from further cuts and ensure that all people in Scotland of whatever financial means can access the healthcare that they deserve.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2456.1</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of the Comments of Andrew Lansley and Defence of the NHS in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2456) in the name of Margaret Curran, leave out from first &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;is wearying of the parade of invitations to pay tribute to the former Lib/Lab administration, rejected by the electorate in May 2007; invites the Scottish Government to press on with evidence-based action to assist the people of Scotland to tackle health inequalities and to do so without fear or favour to the record of the Labour party, which having governed the people of Glasgow for decades has singularly failed to improve health inequalities within the city, and calls on members of all parties to measure success less by reference to health spending and more by reference to health outcomes while ensuring that all people in Scotland, of whatever financial means, can access the healthcare they deserve.&quot;</p>
