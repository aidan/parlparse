    and developments in budgetary mechanisms that it contains, and commends this as an example
    of the success of the Partnership Agreement and as an appropriate opportunity to work with
    the UK Government for the betterment of Scotland.</font> </p>

    publication by the Scottish Executive of the report Social Justice &#150; a Scotland where
    everyone matters; believes however that the report lacks definition, range, focus and
    clear achievable targets and agrees that the Executive should re-evaluate the report

    statements not targets; does not provide any proposals for action or details of funding;
    does not set out any meaningful way in which progress on the issues highlighted can be
