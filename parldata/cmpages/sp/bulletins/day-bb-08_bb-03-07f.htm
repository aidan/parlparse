<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1513</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Pensions Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the UK Pensions Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 5 December 2007, which legislate in devolved areas in respect of pension compensation on divorce or dissolution of a marriage or civil partnership, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1512</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Motor Neurone Disease Breakthrough</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the work of Professor Chris Shaw and his team, funded by the Motor Neurone Disease Association; welcomes the news that their work may have uncovered a possible direction for future research into the operation of the TDP-43 protein in some sufferers, and hopes that this work and other efforts like it will lead towards treatments to address the effects of this devastating disease.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1511</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Maternity Services in West Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s decision that antenatal services will be retained in the west end of Glasgow, following the closure of the Queen Mother&rsquo;s Maternity Hospital in 2009, with a temporary service provided on the Western Infirmary campuses and calls on the NHS board to continue looking for a west end location to ensure local provision for mothers-to-be in the long term.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1510</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Brain Awareness Week: 10 to 16 March 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of brain research in increasing understanding, improving treatment and changing lives; applauds the work of researchers working in Scotland and further afield to make a difference to the 1,000,000 people in Scotland who live with neurological conditions; takes pride in Scotland&rsquo;s place as a centre of excellence in neurosciences; welcomes the voluntary sector&rsquo;s role as important funders of this vital work, and the role of the Neurological Alliance of Scotland in building links between groups affected by different conditions, and believes that the Scottish Government and other funders should consider making support for brain research a priority.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Lamont<strong>*</strong>, Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Jackson Carlaw<strong>*</strong>, Cathy Peattie<strong>*</strong>, Joe FitzPatrick<strong>*</strong>, Mary Scanlon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1509</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Denis Law and Stop the Cuts Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the comments by Kittybrewster School former pupil, Denis Law, in support of the campaign against the closure of Kittybrewster School; further welcomes his support for the campaign to save Bon Accord baths in Aberdeen; agrees with Denis Law that the administration of Aberdeen City Council should listen to the views of local people; calls on Aberdeen City Council to abandon its closure plans for Kittybrewster School, Bon Accord baths and many other vital services and facilities in the city, and as a matter of urgency further calls on the council to reconsider its plans to reduce revenue expenditure by &pound;27 million in the forthcoming financial year.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1508</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>No Smoking Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes No Smoking Day on 12 March 2008; celebrates the reduction in heart attacks and other smoking-related diseases that is already becoming apparent in Scotland following the legislative ban on smoking in public places, and regrets that continued progress in this undoubted benefit for the health of the people of Scotland may be hindered by the funding cuts in real terms for smoking cessation programmes introduced by the Scottish Government.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1507</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Clothing is Not an Invitation to Rape</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the comments made by defence lawyer and temporary sheriff, Iain Smith, in a recent sexual assault case&nbsp;in Perth Sheriff Court in which he used the clothing worn by the 15-year-old victim and reports that she may have been sexually active to claim that &quot;she was not vulnerable&quot; as part of a mitigation plea for his client; notes that the use of comments such as this by representatives of the legal profession is unacceptable and contributes to Scotland&rsquo;s low rates of prosecution in cases of rape and sexual assault; recognises the Scottish Government&rsquo;s campaign to change the attitudes toward rape and sexual assault, in particular to challenge the view that rape or sexual assault can be justified by the way a woman or girl behaves, her previous sexual activity or the clothing she is wearing, and urges the Scottish legal profession to take action to ensure&nbsp;that the use of such a defence or mitigation plea is no longer acceptable.</p>
