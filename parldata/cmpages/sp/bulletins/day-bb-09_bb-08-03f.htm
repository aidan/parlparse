<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4652</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Crysis? What Crysis?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the UK government&rsquo;s Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Aldermaston is currently recruiting for an engineering virtual reality specialist to utilise serious gaming for training nuclear weapons scientists; considers that the job advertisement in question indicates that the AWE is particularly looking for someone with modification and level-creation experience of 3D terrain games and provides the example of <em>Crysis</em>, a first-person shooter game in which the player skirmishes with, among others, North Koreans and extraterrestrial enemies, and believes the conflation of the fantasy world of gaming with the realities of nuclear war, in this way, to be representative of the UK Government&rsquo;s scant regard for taking nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament seriously.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4651</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Rag Tag &lsquo;n&rsquo; Textile, Social Enterprise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the work of Rag Tag &lsquo;n&rsquo; Textile, based in Balmacara near Kyle of Lochalsh and Broadford, Isle of Skye, as a social enterprise teaching traditional textile skills to people with mental health issues; notes that Rag Tag produces and makes a wide range of items that are designed in-house and created in their workshops using donated fabric and wool; further notes that all fabrics used are recycled, saving waste and looking after the environment, and welcomes the fact that the enterprise allows for a significant number of people with a disability or other disadvantage to work alongside non-disabled people and that it offers equal work opportunities, employment rights and obligations to all employees.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4650</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Department of Culture, Media and Sport Review of Listed Events</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the BBC Trust submission to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Review of Listed Events, which recommends the inclusion of the 2014 Commonwealth Games and Scotland&rsquo;s football world cup campaign within the BBC&rsquo;s free-to-air events; hopes that the DCMS review will fully implement the recommendations of the BBC Trust, and encourages all those involved in the delivery of these sporting events to work together to achieve this common aim.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4649</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Ruchill&rsquo;s Got Talent</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates SLS, winners of the Ruchill&rsquo;s Got Talent contest run by Ruchill Youth Project and Maryhill Housing Association; commends all the acts that took part in the competition, including the runners up, Jemma McManus and Connor Owens; acknowledges the opportunity provided by Beat Route, the north Glasgow music project for young people, for the winning act to record their song, <em>Hero</em>, and welcomes the fact that this contest has confirmed that Ruchill does indeed have talent.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4648</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Launch of Iraq Inquiry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the launch of the Iraq inquiry, chaired by Sir John Chilcot; believes that the launch will be welcomed by the many individuals and organisations, including the Scottish Parliament, who have been calling for such an inquiry; reiterates its call for as much of the inquiry to be held in public as possible; further believes that the inquiry must cover issues relating to the legality of the decision to go to war in the first place, that any witnesses, including the current and former prime ministers, should positively respond to a call for evidence and that an interim report should be published if at all possible before the UK general election, and hopes that lessons learned by the inquiry will ensure that an illegal and unnecessary conflict like the war in Iraq never happens again.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4647</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Campaign Against Diageo Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, further to motion S3M-4568 lodged on 6 July 2009, notes that a major cross-party campaign has been established to oppose Diageo&rsquo;s restructuring proposals that would see the closure of plants at Kilmarnock, Hurlford and Port Dundas with the loss of hundreds of jobs in the Scotch whisky industry and a devastating impact on local communities; endorses the statement by the First Minister calling these proposals socially unacceptable; welcomes the action of the Scottish Government in commissioning an alternative business plan for consideration by Diageo, and echoes the call of thousands of people who took part in the march and rally in Kilmarnock on 26 July for a rethink of these proposals and a secure and successful future for the workers and their communities and for the company.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4646&diams; </strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Tokyo Beer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the extent of health and criminal justice problems associated with excessive and unhealthy alcohol consumption in Glasgow and other parts of Scotland; notes the production of Tokyo beer by BrewDog brewery; further notes that Tokyo is being cited as Britain&rsquo;s strongest beer; is concerned that, with an alcohol content of 18.2%, each 330ml bottle will contain the equivalent of six units of alcohol, which is twice the recommended daily limit for women set by health professionals; recognises the significant health and social harms associated with irresponsible drinking; further recognises that major cultural change is required if Scotland is to tackle its damaging relationship with alcohol, and therefore believes that promoting drinks of this kind with both a very high alcohol content and unit volume is reprehensible in a society where the medical evidence shows that, across all age groups and socio-economic categories, individuals are drinking too much alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4645</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Scottish Police Board</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision to set up a new Scottish Policing Board to be chaired by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice; further notes that this board is to act as a single collective voice for policing; recognises that local policing has long proved its worth in Scotland and therefore believes that a one-size-fits-all approach to policing is entirely wrong; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s police forces must remain operationally independent of government; asserts that major policy initiatives of this kind are clearly a matter for parliamentary approval; further believes that convening a National Policing Board without debate in Parliament and with no basis in law is a slippery slope towards a single Scottish Police Service, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to defer these proposals until detailed plans can be debated in the Parliament and approved or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4644#</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Votes for Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the new exhibition, <em>Votes for Women: The Women&rsquo;s Suffrage Movement in Edinburgh</em>, at the Museum of Edinburgh from 31 July 2009 to 9 January 2010; notes that the exhibition uses photos and artefacts to chart the long struggle to win the vote, which was eventually granted to all women in 1928; further notes that at the height of the campaign in October 1909 a grand pageant was held in Edinburgh and to honour its 100 year anniversary and history of women&rsquo;s activism a re-enactment march will take place on 10 October 2009; encourages all women to join in the parade in honour of all suffragettes who fought hard for all sisters to have a free vote; congratulates the Gude Cause, based at the Edinburgh Peace and Justice Centre, for organising the march and complementary events, and further notes that more information can be found at <a href="http://www.gudecause.org.uk" target="_blank">www.gudecause.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4643</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Exhibit Untitled 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the number of complaints that have been made with regard to the <em>Untitled 2009</em> exhibit at the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow; considers the exhibit, which encourages the vandalism of a bible, to be of questionable taste and displaying a lack of respect toward those who value the bible as a holy book; further considers it inappropriate that Culture and Sport Glasgow has used public money to promote this particular exhibit, and calls for the immediate withdrawal of the exhibit.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4642</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>Award for Wishaw General Hospital Pharmacy Staff</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Wishaw General Hospital&rsquo;s pharmacy dispensary and its staff who won a national award after slashing the time that it takes to issue prescriptions; notes that the pharmacy was given the award after staff increased the number of prescriptions that it dispensed during a 60 minute period from 42% to 69%; acknowledges the benefits that this improvement provides to patients throughout the area, and wishes the staff continued success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4641#</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Celebrating the Scottish-Polish Connection</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commemorates the 70th anniversary of the arrival of the Polish navy in Leith on 1 September 1939; notes that the three Polish destroyers Burza (Storm), Grom (Thunder) and Blyskawica (Lightning) saw service alongside the Royal Navy during the Second World War, with Grom being sunk with heavy loss of life on 4 May 1940; recognises that the arrival of the destroyers marked the beginning of a strong wartime Scottish-Polish connection with several squadrons of the Polish Air Force serving in the country and Polish ships based at a number of Scottish ports, including Rosyth, Greenock, Port Glasgow, Ardrossan, Gourock, Dundee and Scapa Flow; further recognises that the main influx of Poles during the war occurred following the collapse of France in 1940 when some 30,000 Polish troops were evacuated to the United Kingdom and were stationed in Scotland, many of whom settled here; notes that a Polish house was organised in Edinburgh by the British Council to help the Polish community socially and educationally at this time; celebrates not just the wartime links but the long historical connection between Scotland and Poland, which includes upwards of 40,000 Scots migrating to Poland during the 17th century, and applauds the work of many organisations, including the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, for helping to develop awareness of the historical connections, promote cultural understanding and foster strong relations between modern generations of Scots and Poles.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4640</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Kinross Otters Swimming Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent Stars of the Future swimming gala at Dundee&rsquo;s Olympia pool; congratulates all those who were winners of medals and all those who achieved personal best times; in particular congratulates the many members of the Kinross Otters swimming club, which goes from strength to strength, and calls on the Scottish Government both to honour its free swimming-for-children manifesto pledge and to match England&rsquo;s achievements where 250 local authorities have now delivered free swimming.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4639</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Proposed Closure of Thistle Nursery by Glasgow College of Nautical Studies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the decision by Glasgow College of Nautical Studies (GCNS) to close its longstanding Thistle Nursery by 2010 and to stop taking children under two years of age from September 2009; notes that GCNS takes almost half its 5,786 students from deprived areas, many of whom are dependent on adequate and convenient childcare facilities to enable them to study; is aware that GCNS intends to continue funding childcare from the college fund but believes that the lack of onsite facilities will cause substantial disruption for many students and act as a deterrent to new students; notes that the college is merging with other city centre Glasgow colleges but that the new super college campus of 50,000 students is not expected to house a nursery or childcare facility; urges GCNS to reconsider its decision, and further believes that the Scottish Funding Council should examine the issue more generally with a view to ensuring adequate and convenient childcare and nursery facilities are available to all college students who need them to continue their studies.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4638</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Increase in Hepatitis C Cases in Grampian</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the rise in new confirmed cases of hepatitis C in Grampian to 184 cases in 2008 from 148 the year before; further notes that an estimated 60% of those suspected to be chronically infected with the disease remain undiagnosed; recognises that hepatitis C can have a serious impact on individuals&rsquo; health and can lead to major complications and eventually death; further recognises that those who are infected with the virus often show no initial symptoms and only around half of those infected are ever fully cured of the disease; believes that not enough is being done to educate people about the risks of this disease, and, given that at present there is no vaccine or cure, calls on ministers to strengthen and repeat messages and advice in order to raise further awareness of hepatitis C and how to avoid contracting it.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4637</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) Congress</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes delegates to the 42nd International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) Congress, which will be held between the 2 and 7 August 2009 in the Glasgow SECC and which over 2,000 people will attend; recognises the important role played by the Royal Society of Chemistry in bringing this prestigious event to Scotland with the support of Schering-Plough, and believes that the conference presents an excellent opportunity to showcase the high quality university departments and strong industrial base that Scotland has in the chemical sciences.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4632</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Olympic-sized Swimming Pool for Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the construction of a full Olympic-sized 10-lane 50 metre swimming pool in Aberdeen; notes with disappointment that the Scottish Government is only helping to fund an eight-lane pool, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that appropriate funding is made available to ensure that the 10-lane pool previously promised is delivered.</p>
