<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7331 Bill Butler: Dundee FC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 25-point deduction imposed on Dundee FC by the Scottish Football League for entering administration; notes also the penalty of a player-signing ban and the threat of further sanctions; further notes that this is the highest such deduction imposed in British senior football and places the 117-year-old former League Champions and European Cup semi-finalists in what it considers to be an extremely precarious position; believes that this decision will come as a further blow to Dundee supporters who, for the second time in a decade, are trying to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds to save their club from liquidation and have already raised almost &pound;100,000 since the club entered administration in October 2010; notes the recent <em>Back on the Ball? </em>report by PKF, which warned that many Scottish clubs were paying out too much of their turnover on player wages, thus leaving them overly reliant on external investment from club owners for survival; considers that the situation at Dundee FC highlights the real need for the sport&rsquo;s governing bodies to work with the Scottish Government and supporters&rsquo; trusts to create a more accountable and transparent system of financial governance of clubs in order to ensure that Scottish football is run primarily for the benefit of supporters; wishes the Dee4Life supporter&rsquo;s trust all the best in its campaign to save Dundee FC by funding a supporters&rsquo; buy-out, and calls on the sport&rsquo;s governing bodies to stand up for ordinary football supporters by backing such initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7330 Andy Kerr: Managing Scotland&rsquo;s Finances</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, despite the Scottish Government having the highest ever Scottish budget and &pound;1.5 billion in reserves when it came to power, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth&rsquo;s wrong choices, which include the waste of money on the discredited Scottish Futures Trust, the cancellation of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the cutting of key economic budgets such as enterprise, regeneration and tourism and the dramatic rise in rates for some businesses, have contributed to Scotland&rsquo;s unemployment rate rising above that of the United Kingdom; considers that the loss of more than 40,000 construction workers, almost 3,000 teachers, 1,000 classroom assistants, 1,500 nurses and 2,500 other NHS posts represents real people carrying out real services; notes that the number of young Scots who are not in work or education or training programmes has increased from 31,000 to 36,000 in the last year; condemns the UK Government for cutting back on support for young people when it is most needed; warns that the mistakes of the Thatcher years are being repeated, and calls on members to do everything in their power to prevent another generation of young people from being denied the opportunity of work or training.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7329 Bill Kidd: Indepen-dance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the efforts of professional dance company Indepen-dance in helping over 1,500 individuals annually; further commends the company for its work with disabled people in the art of performing dance; considers the mainstreaming of disabled people with other choreographers and dancers to be significant progress; congratulates the company for all its work, and wishes it and its performers every success in the future.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7327 Bruce Crawford: Housing (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Housing (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7325 Liam McArthur: Orkney Athletics Club, Joint Track and Field Club of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Orkney Athletic Club was named as the joint winner of the Track and Field Club of the Year award at the scottishathletics Annual Awards Dinner, sharing the award with the Edinburgh Athletics Club; recognises the success of the club in developing athletics in Orkney, with what is considered a commendable 80% of its members being under 18 years old; considers that the club has an excellent home base at the Pickaquoy Centre in Kirkwall but faces considerable financial and logistical challenges when competing on the Scottish mainland, and congratulates the club&rsquo;s members, coaches and committee on their success in winning this award, which it considers well earned.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7313 David Whitton: Thomas Muir Heritage Trail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposed new 11-mile heritage trail in East Dunbartonshire, which highlights buildings and features that have a connection to the political reformer considered the founding father of Scottish democracy, Thomas Muir; notes that the trail begins at Clachan of Campsie, traversing through Lennoxtown, Kirkintilloch and other places of importance to Muir before ending at his home at Huntershill House in Bishopbriggs, and hopes that this heritage trail will raise awareness of what it considers this almost forgotten hero and, at the same time, promote outdoor activities, education, local history and tourism.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7312 Anne McLaughlin: In Memory of Zouhair Baya and Ibrahim Benothman</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Jamal Baya to Scotland on his trip to visit the grave of his brother; notes that Mr Baya is the brother of Zouhair Baya, a Tunisian who stowed away, along with Ibrahim Benothman, aboard the cargo ship, the Pascal, which was carrying a cargo of phosphates from Sfax in Tunisia to Scotland; understands that both young men were found dead when the ship docked in Ayr harbour in 2008; expresses its sympathy to Mr Baya and his family; recalls that the Muslim community in Glasgow organised a burial for Zouhair and Ibrahim at Cathcart cemetery and that only after the men were buried were they identified following what it considers the laudable determination of various people across Scotland to do so; thanks the Muslim community in Glasgow and Edinburgh for helping to both identify Zouhair and organise his brother&rsquo;s visit; thanks also the Port Authority in Ayr, the Scots-Tunisian community and others, and hopes that the visit will be of benefit to Jamal Baya and his family, helping them to come to terms with this family tragedy.&#8234;&#8234;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7311 Rob Gibson: Beware GM Salmon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the possibility that the Food and Drug Administration in the United States of America may consent to the farming of genetically modified (GM) salmon; considers that escapees are likely to occur through time and can easily reach the shores of Scotland, altering forever the genetic integrity of wild Atlantic salmon and of quality Scottish farmed salmon, and calls on the Scottish Government to monitor the GM salmon consent process in the USA and express, both directly and via the UK Government and the European Union, Scotland&rsquo;s right to maintain the biodiversity of wild Atlantic salmon and farmed salmon grown in its waters.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7280 Bob Doris: Alasdair Gray Rejects Lib Dem Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges what it considers to be the utter disillusionment felt by many people who voted Liberal Democrat for the first time at the May 2010 UK General Election; understands that one such voter is the acclaimed Scots novelist and artist Alasdair Gray and that, following what it believes are the savage cuts brought to Scotland by the UK Conservative and Liberal Democrat government, Mr Gray has now withdrawn his support for the Liberal Democrats and will once again support the Scottish National Party.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7280.1 Johann Lamont: Alasdair Gray Rejects Lib Dem Cuts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7280) in the name of Bob Doris, leave out from &quot;Mr Gray&quot; to end and insert &quot;it therefore regrets that SNP leader Alex Salmond recommended to voters in England that voting Liberal Democrat in the 2010 general election would be &quot;a legitimate and proper thing to do&quot;, and calls on him to admit his mistake publicly and apologise accordingly.&quot;</p>
