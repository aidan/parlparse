<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2602</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Hamilton College on Reaching its 25-Year Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to congratulate and recognise the achievements of Hamilton College in South Lanarkshire on reaching its 25-year anniversary; further recognises that the private co-educational Christian school, which was opened by the late Charles Oxley in 1983, has achieved major academic success; also congratulates Hamilton College on being the first independent school in Scotland to achieve the Health Promoting Schools gold award status in 2008, and hopes that the success and achievements of the school will continue in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2601</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh&rsquo;s Citizens Advice Bureaux</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of Citizens Advice Edinburgh (CAE) to close four CAB offices across the city, specifically in Pilton, Leith, Fountainbridge and Portobello; appreciates that CAE both regrets this decision and considers it to be a direct consequence of inadequate funding from the City of Edinburgh Council; understands that the funding settlement has always been tight and believes that relevant constituency and regional MSPs have always supported CAE and the invaluable services that it offers to communities across Edinburgh; is deeply concerned about the impact of centralising these services for individuals who have mobility or financial difficulties believing that an expansion of online facilities automatically excludes a significant proportion of users who are neither computer literate nor have ready access to computer facilities; further believes that this development is an unacceptable alternative to frontline advice services, and resolves to work together to reverse this shocking cut to vital local services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2600</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>European Year of Innovation and Creativity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2009 has been designated as European Year of Innovation and Culture by the European Commission and European Parliament; acknowledges the importance that innovation and creativity play in a nation&rsquo;s cultural and economic success; notes the reputation of Scotland as a centre of innovation; further notes the success of Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s Proof of Concept Programme, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to work with the UK Government to ensure that work is undertaken to use the year of innovation and culture as a platform to boost innovation and creativity in Scotland and also to promote and consolidate Scotland&rsquo;s place in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2599#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Summerlee - The Scottish Museum of Industrial Life</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the re-opening in Coatbridge of Summerlee, the Scottish Museum of Industrial Life, on Friday 26 September 2008 following a major &pound;10 million redevelopment; congratulates North Lanarkshire Council, its employees and the Friends of Summerlee Redevelopment Appeal, who have worked tirelessly to ensure the project&rsquo;s completion; welcomes the &pound;5 million contribution made by the Heritage Lottery Fund alongside the contributions from North Lanarkshire Council, the Scottish Museums Council, the European Regional Development Fund and the redevelopment appeal; encourages further donations to that appeal, which can be made up until 31 October 2008; notes that Summerlee was formerly one of Scotland&rsquo;s most important ironworks; recognises the importance of keeping our industrial heritage alive through the preservation of the history of local iron, steel, coal and engineering industries; considers that Summerlee offers an invaluable educational resource providing an opportunity to reflect on the hard work and sacrifice of the working class of Scotland&rsquo;s industrial heartland and to remember the difficult circumstances in which they worked and lived; further considers it appropriate that North Lanarkshire Workers Memorial is situated at the gates of Summerlee, commemorating International Workers Memorial Day, and encourages visitors to come and see first-hand the excellent facilities, which include interactive displays, a kids&rsquo; discovery zone, children&rsquo;s outdoor play area, shop, caf&eacute; and exhibition area, ensuring that Summerlee takes its place as a leading visitor attraction and a landmark heritage facility for the 21st century.</p>
