          <p><strong>*S2M-1277#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Prescription 
            Charges and Penalty Charges</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            that significant numbers of patients are not accessing the health 
            care they need because they cannot afford the £6.40 charged for each 
            prescription item; further notes the Citizens Advice Bureau report, 
            <em>Penalising prescription poverty</em>,<em> </em>in January 2004 
            which suggests that many people on incapacity benefits are confused 
            as to whether or not they qualify for free prescriptions and are falling 
            foul of penalty charges introduced by the Health Act 1999; believes 
            that patients in poor health and on low incomes are being severely 
            penalised by the present system, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should look at outright abolition of prescription charges as one of 
            the options in its forthcoming review.</P>

            town of Falkirk on the recent success of its Big in Falkirk street 
            and community arts festival; acknowledges the hard work of all those 
            people who contributed to the event, and thanks the various sponsors 
            and artists who contributed to its success.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1273</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Daily 
            Newspapers</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the decision of the 
            Royal Mail to cease carrying small circulation newspapers by air, 
            in particular, removing from newsagents supplies of The Morning Star, 
            Britain's sole international socialist daily newspaper, and the Daily 
            Jang, an Urdu daily paper serving, amongst others, Scotland's Muslim 
            population; regards a diverse range of newspapers as being healthy 
            for democracy, and urges the Royal Mail to reconsider its decision.</P>

            of Stirling Ale</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Bridge

            Kingdom breweries to secure Tesco's &quot;Beer Challenge Winner&quot; 
            title and therefore securing a contract to supply all Tesco's UK stores 
            with the speciality City of Stirling ale and believes a similar blind 
            beer-tasting competition should be held for a Parliamentary ale that 
            could be available in the new Parliament Building and on sale in the 
            Parliament shop.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1271</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Kids'

            New Zealand for his efforts in making the Kids' Lit Quiz a global 
            literary challenge event for school students by expanding from New 
            Zealand to the UK in 2003; further congratulates the students, and 
            supporting staff, at Dunblane High School on their tremendous achievement 
            in coming first and second in the Scottish heat and going on to win 
            the UK final, and wishes the team all the best for the international

            adults with autistic spectrum disorders, their families and carers; 
            further recognises the Scottish Executive's announcement of investment 
            in services and support, focusing, in particular, on adults in the 
            Glasgow and Edinburgh areas, and looks forward to an enhancement in 
            services for children and adults affected by autistic spectrum disorders 
            across Scotland.</P>

          <p><strong>*S2M-1269</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Nicola Benedetti</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Nicola 
            Benedetti of West Kilbride in Ayrshire on her well-deserved achievement 
            of becoming the BBC Young Musician of the Year; regards a good musical 
            education as a fundamental right for all Scottish schoolchildren, 
            and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that sufficient funds are 
            made available for all children in state schools who wish to learn 
            to play a musical instrument free of charge.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1268</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Airdrie 
            United Football Club</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 
            players, management, staff and supporters at Airdrie United on gaining 
            promotion to the First Division only two years after the inception 
            of the club and welcomes the club's commitment to working in partnership 
            with the community by including a representative from the Supporters' 
            Trust on the Board of Directors.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1266.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Scotland's 
            Beaches - A National Resource</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1266) 
            in the name of Allan Wilson, insert at end &quot;but notes the importance 
            of continuing improvement in bathing water quality in Scotland to 
            the quality of our beaches and believes that further progress is now 
            dependent on addressing the limitations of Scottish Water and the 
            planning system.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1266.2</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Scotland's 
            Beaches - A National Resource</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1266) 
            in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;, while welcoming the results of the recent 
            Keep Scotland Beautiful survey of resort beaches with the granting 
            of Seaside Awards to 40 Scottish beaches including 14 new recipients, 
            acknowledges the impact of beach litter as highlighted in the recent 
            Marine Conservation Society's Beachwatch 2003 Report; notes that the 
            report's findings include a net increase in beach litter and that 
            sewage-related debris accounts for a higher proportion of beach litter 
            in Scotland than elsewhere in the United Kingdom; further notes that, 
            while encouraging the public to take more responsibility for its own 
            litter, the report also states that determined efforts are required 
            to reduce pollution at source and that local authorities, water authorities 
            and Her Majesty's Government must play their part in reducing and 
            cleaning up litter; further notes that the environmental quality of 
            beaches encompasses much more than litter alone, and calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to display a strong lead following the consultation 
            on the best strategy for protecting and enhancing all of Scotland's 
            coastline as pledged in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em>, 
            including consideration of an integrated Marine Act.&quot;</P>

            in the name of Allan Wilson, insert at end &quot;and calls on the 
            Executive to step up pressure against illegal disposal of waste at 
            sea including discharges by the nuclear industry.&quot;</P>
