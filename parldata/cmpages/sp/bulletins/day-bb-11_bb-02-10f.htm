<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7930 Helen Eadie: First Female Premier of Tasmania</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its warmest congratulations to Lara Giddings who, in the first session, worked as a parliamentary research officer for the member for Dunfermline East, Helen Eadie, and who was last month elected as the first female Premier of Tasmania, having previously been the youngest woman elected to an Australian parliament at the age of 23 years; notes that Giddings was elected as Australian Labor Party deputy leader and sworn in as deputy premier, prior to which she worked for the Tasmanian premier as a speech writer and media assistant, and also notes that, from 2004 to 2006, Giddings was Minister for Economic Development and Minister for the Arts and, following the 2006 election, she was assigned the role of Minister for Health and Human Services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7929 Patricia Ferguson: Local Tenants Say Yes to Maryhill Housing Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the achievement of Maryhill Housing Association in securing a yes vote in its recent second stage transfer ballot; congratulates the association on securing the support of 72% of Glasgow Housing Association tenants voting in the ballot; believes that this result reflects the hard work of the association over many years, with tenants voting for a local landlord making local decisions, and wishes the association and its new tenants well as they continue the work of building a better Maryhill and Ruchill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7928 Ken Macintosh: The Life and Works of the Rev Ernest Levy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh&rsquo;s library service for its work in preserving and exhibiting the archives of the Rev Ernest Levy; recognises the warmth and humanity of what it considers this remarkable individual, qualities that endured despite his ordeal at the hands of the Nazis in the concentration camps of the Second World War; praises the work of Ernest Levy in sharing his experience as a Holocaust survivor with successive generations through his writing, interviews and particularly his talks with school pupils; appreciates the generosity of Ernest&rsquo;s family, including his daughter, Judithm, in gifting his manuscripts, pictures, music and memoirs to Edinburgh City Libraries in his adopted homeland of Scotland, and welcomes the legacy that Ernest has left, not of bitterness and suffering but of life and hope.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7927 Jackie Baillie: URTV Helensburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the founders of a new local online television channel for Helensburgh, URTV Helensburgh; notes that the channel was launched on the 85th anniversary of John Logie Baird&rsquo;s first transmission; understands that the channel will provide daily news bulletins, features and local information for the community; believes that the enterprise will be a force for good in the local area, and wishes the channel every success.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7926 Jackie Baillie: Save Three Village Libraries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Argyll and Bute Council is proposing to close the village libraries of Cardross, Rosneath and Tarbert; considers that these facilities have an important educational and recreational role in their communities, providing valuable access to books, magazines and newspapers to people of all ages; believes that these local facilities actively encourage literacy and the uptake of reading among children and young people; considers these community and educational services important, and urges Argyll and Bute Council to find savings elsewhere to protect them.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7925 Jackie Baillie: Reverse Unfair Cuts to Argyll and Bute</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers the scale of the reduction in the 2011-12 budget of Argyll and Bute Council as the greatest of any local authority in Scotland, a reduction of 4.94% on 2010-11; notes that this is double the average cuts in the settlement for other local authorities; understands that the COSLA leaders meeting on 19 November 2010 had agreed to update the indicators and maintain the existing distribution for Supporting People funding but, due to a miscalculation, the Scottish Government has allocated less funding to Argyll and Bute than it should have received; understands that West Dunbartonshire has been similarly affected, and urges the Scottish Government to reverse cuts to this funding in Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire to protect vital local services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7924 Bill Kidd: UK Government Cuts to Nuclear Safety Apparatus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern comments made by officials from the Propsect trade union that nuclear safety is being jeopardised at Her Majesty&rsquo;s Naval Base (HMNB) Clyde by privatisation plans and job cuts by the UK Government; further notes the poor safety record at Faslane recorded by an internal Ministry of Defence (MoD) report from 2008, with failure to abide by safety procedures described as a recurring theme; considers that the number of MoD officials working to ensure safety of nuclear submarine operations has been reduced significantly from 42 to four in recent years; believes defence decisions being taken by the UK Government to be wrong for Scotland, and calls on the UK Government to scrap plans for both further cutbacks and privatisation of nuclear safety.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7923.1 Ross Finnie: Early Intervention in Health and Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7923) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;agrees with the conclusions of the Finance Committee&rsquo;s recent inquiry into preventative spending that the current balance of government spending is skewed too much in favour of reactive, rather than preventative, spending; recognises that early intervention has proven benefits not only in health and education but also in other areas such as crime reduction measures, support for carers and services for older people, and supports a long-term shift to sustained investment in a high-quality, preventative approach to the growing social and economic challenges faced by public services.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7923.2 Des McNulty: Early Intervention in Health and Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7923) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that NHS boards and local authorities working with third sector organisations and volunteers must give children&rsquo;s community services more integrated resources; recognises the valuable role being played by Sure Start and Family Centres and expresses concern regarding the impact of funding reductions on low-income families; further believes that health visitors linked with a GP practice and social workers have a key role to play in assessing, advising and supporting the parents of babies and very young children, especially young mums; welcomes the nurse family partnership pilots but proposes that Health for All Children 4 guidance should now be reviewed; considers that families should be partners in determining how services, including parenting support, should be provided; believes that early education and care is vital in providing a positive start for every child as well as in identifying and overcoming barriers to learning such as poor language and communication skills; believes that, where a child is at risk of neglect or abuse, a strict timeline for intervention is required, and welcomes the pilot being undertaken by Glasgow City Council, ensuring that giving every child the best chance in life as well as the protection of the child are the overriding considerations.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7923.3 Shona Robison: Early Intervention in Health and Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7923) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;the establishment of the Modernising Nursing in the Community Board, which is working with NHS boards to ensure that community nursing services in Scotland are fit for the 21st century, and further notes the increase in public health nurses/health visitors during the current parliamentary session; supports the current flexible use and mix of state, partnership and private provision of nursery school places in line with local needs and circumstances; welcomes the fact that the vast majority of Scottish local authorities and their partners have local parenting strategies in place, and endorses the current financial support to the leading third sector organisations that provide information and support to parents, including family mediation organisations that provide assistance to families in difficulty.&quot;</p>
