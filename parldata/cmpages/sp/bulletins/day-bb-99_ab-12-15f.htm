    Trials</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the huge distress that can be caused to the
    victims of rape and other sexual crimes if accused persons are allowed to conduct their

    an amendment to motion (S1M-378) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from
    &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the increased pressure being placed on
    the Scottish budget through the effects of the &quot;Barnett Squeeze&quot;, which means
    that spending is increased two and a half times quicker in England than in Scotland
    despite the fact that there is no evidence of a reduction in relative need; calls upon the
    Scottish Executive to prepare a detailed assessment of the impact of the &quot;Barnett
    Squeeze&quot; in consultation with the Finance Committee; regrets the fact that the
    Parliament is not responsible for raising the revenue it allocates, and notes that normal
    fiscal autonomy would secure maximum fiscal responsibility and accountability and would
    allow the Scottish Parliament to allocate the required resources for Scottish public
    services&quot;.</p>
