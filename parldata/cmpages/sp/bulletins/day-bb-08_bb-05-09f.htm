<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1872</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Scots Music Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is extremely disappointed that the Scottish Arts Council has withdrawn funding from the award-winning Edinburgh Scots Music Group (SMG); notes that the group was formed in 1990 out of Edinburgh Adult Learning Project&rsquo;s education and community development process and that the SMG has taught traditional music song and dance to literally thousands of adults over almost two decades, making a vital contribution to bringing the tradition back into the heart of community and cultural life in Scotland; further notes that SMG was voted Community Project of the Year at the BBC Radio Scotland Traditional Music Awards in November 2007; believes that the Scottish Arts Council should fund the maintenance of traditional forms, continuing successful and popular initiatives and voluntary organisations that are delivering all this and creating and maintaining participative traditional arts in communities, and further believes that the Scottish Government should ensure that Scottish cultural policy explicitly states the importance of such funding.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1871</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>A School of Ambition - Kirkland High</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kirkland High School in Methil, Fife, for making good progress in its latest HM Inspectorate of Education report; welcomes Kirkland High pupils to the Parliament for the Europe Day Conference; congratulates the headteacher, Ronnie Ross, and his team of staff for bringing improvements in pupil attainment; notes that the report highlights areas where improvements could be made and that the school is continuing to work hard to bring about the required improvements; highlights that Kirkland High was part of the schools of ambition programme which allowed the school to invest heavily including in its drama facilities; notes that the report highlights that pupil attainment was strongest in art, music and computing, and strongly condemns the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision to axe the schools of ambition programme and its failure to provide any replacement funding programme and fears that future opportunities for similar investment by Kirkland High and other schools of ambition will not be possible, reducing opportunities for many pupils from deprived areas across Scotland to fulfil their true potential.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1870</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Baroness Michie of Gallanach</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sorrow the death of Ray Michie, who had a long and distinguished career in Scottish politics, serving as the Liberal Democrat MP for Argyll and Bute from 1987 to 2001 and then as Baroness Michie of Gallanach in the House of Lords until her passing, and pays tribute to her lifelong commitment to the Gaelic language, Highland culture and, most of all, her unswerving campaigning for the establishment of a Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1869</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Stroke Awareness Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Stroke Awareness Day on Tuesday 13 May 2008, which is an annual health campaign that aims to increase public knowledge of strokes and the need for urgent diagnosis because of its devastating effects; recognises that a stroke is one of the top three causes of death in the United Kingdom and the leading cause of severe disability; commends the hard work of the Stroke Association in campaigning for improved health and social care for stroke survivors and their families; further recognises that each year 150,000 people suffer a stroke in the UK; acknowledges the role of frontline staff in delivering and developing services for the thousands of people affected each year; welcomes the significant improvements in prevention and rehabilitation over the last nine years; supports health improvement initiatives to reduce the incidence of stroke, and looks forward to the development of more integrated services that are backed up by significant and dedicated resources.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1868</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>International Nurses Day 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates International Nurses Day on 12 May, which marks Florence Nightingale&rsquo;s birthday; recognises the invaluable role that nurses have played throughout the 60-year history of the NHS in Scotland, one that has changed beyond recognition since the days of Florence Nightingale and is now even more important, and believes that it is more important than ever that the Scottish Government undertakes effective workforce planning to meet probable future shortages, especially in mental health nursing.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1867</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>World Hepatitis Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports World Hepatitis Day on 19 May 2008 as a means of increasing awareness of hepatitis worldwide; recognises the significance of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s estimates that there could be as many as 500 million people chronically infected with Hepatitis B and C; welcomes the completion of phase one of the previous Scottish Administration&rsquo;s Hepatitis C action plan and the impending launch of phase two of the plan, and further recognises that with early diagnosis and dramatic improvements in treatment hepatitis is, in the majority of cases, now curable.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1866</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Flying the Rainbow Flag at Holyrood on International Day Against Homophobia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that International Day Against Homophobia takes place on 17 May; expresses dismay that there are still 77 countries in the world today where it is a criminal offence to be gay and that these countries punish women, men and children because of their sexuality and that in seven countries the punishment is death; supports actions being taken by the Scottish Government as well as local authorities, the voluntary sector and others to combat homophobic prejudice, discrimination and violence, and considers that it would also be highly appropriate for the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to arrange for the flying of a rainbow flag from one of the flagpoles at the main entrance to Holyrood on 17 May 2008 and on International Day Against Homophobia each year thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1865&diams; </strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>A Tenancy Deposit Protection Scheme for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the withholding of deposits unreasonably continues to be a problem for tenants in the private rented sector; notes that the private rented sector provides over 230,000 homes to households in Scotland, some 8% of all households, including families, students, migrant workers and young professionals; further notes that many tenants, on leaving a tenancy, rely on the return of their deposit to pay the upfront deposit and rent for their new property and that withholding a deposit unfairly can lead to hardship, debt and ultimately homelessness; highlights recent research by St Andrew&rsquo;s University Student Union that found that 24% of students there have had unjustified deductions made from their deposits and 28% have faced unreasonable delays of more than 28 days in returning their deposits; acknowledges the successful introduction of the tenancy deposit protection scheme in operation in England and Wales which ensures protection for both landlords and tenants, and believes that powers already on statute in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 could be used to further a deposit protection scheme for Scotland, building on landlord registration and accreditation initiatives already in place.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1864</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Keep INTO Out</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed introduction of private company, INTO, to deliver core education provision at Glasgow Caledonian University; considers that privatisation of this provision would undoubtedly be detrimental to the quality of service delivery as it is unlikely to be of the same quality as mainstream provision; acknowledges the impact on terms and conditions of staff employed by private companies like INTO which is likely to reduce their morale and ultimately impact on the quality of the learning experience of students; notes that Glasgow Caledonian University is a publicly funded institution and is therefore accountable for how it uses its public funds; recognises the obligation of Scottish universities to remain active in the recruitment of international students unable to access appropriate education in their native countries and therefore accepts the need to provide a consistently superior service that is not subject to market demands; notes that education is far too important to be trusted to market forces, and believes that the introduction of the private sector in such a sensitive area of educational provision is clearly dangerous and must be resisted.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1863</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Preston Lodge Rugby Football Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Preston Lodge RFC on winning the Scottish Hydro Electric National Bowl final held at Murrayfield Stadium on 3 May 2008 by 18 points to 10; commends its performance and that of its opponents, Dalziel RFC; applauds both sets of fans for their vociferous and passionate support of their teams; regrets that the future of the Scottish Hydro Electric Cup, Plate, Bowl and Shield competitions are in doubt, and hopes that these competitions will be retained in the Scottish rugby calendar for the benefit of rugby clubs, their players and supporters around the country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1862</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Cove Rangers, Champions of the Scottish Highland Football League</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Cove Rangers FC for winning this season&rsquo;s Scottish Highland Football League; notes that the club can achieve the league and cup double when it competes in the Scottish Highland League Cup final on 10 May 2008, and hopes that Scottish football will make progress in developing a pyramid system to allow Cove Rangers FC and other clubs the opportunity to compete in the Scottish Football League.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1861#</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Support for Veterans in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that ex-service personnel in Ochil and throughout Scotland often suffer particular problems in areas such as health, employment, housing and pensions; welcomes the recent Scottish Government announcements of support for the Houses for Heroes Campaign, run by the Scottish Veterans&rsquo; Garden City Association, and the Scottish Veterans&rsquo; Fund, run in association with Veterans Scotland; believes that the commitment to assistance from a Scottish perspective is particularly important; further believes that the Parliament should be at the centre of the developing debate about how best to provide appropriate support to ex-service personnel, and welcomes any initiatives by the Scottish Government to continue to engage with the range of organisations involved in supporting ex-service personnel and addressing the challenges that they face.</p>
