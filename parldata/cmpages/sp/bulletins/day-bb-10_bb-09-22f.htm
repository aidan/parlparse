<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7047 Stewart Stevenson: A Low Carbon Economy for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that Scotland is developing a national consensus and determination to play a full role in developing the technologies skills and expertise to build a low carbon economy; welcomes the job opportunities associated with the further development of low carbon technologies, and notes that the net effect of these and other initiatives has been to position Scotland as a preferred international destination for low carbon investment.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7046 Ian McKee: European Day of Languages 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the European Day of Languages 2010; notes that this is a Europe-wide celebration that promotes linguistic diversity and language learning across Europe; further notes that the event, which this year is scheduled to take place on 26th September, was set up by the Council of Europe and was first celebrated in 2001; considers that the event is increasing in popularity each year, with 45 countries now participating; congratulates the many schools and institutes organising activities to celebrate it, including St. George&rsquo;s School for Girls in Edinburgh, which will hold a teach a friend a language week, and Sciennes Primary School which will teach a special Study of Europe followed by its own Eurovision song contest; further congratulates the Institut Fran&ccedil;ais d&rsquo;Ecosse which has developed a quiz and resource pack for teachers; encourages all schools in Scotland to take part in the celebrations, and to recognise the importance of language learning in school and experience the benefits that it can bring.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7045 Richard Baker: The Future of Forensics Services in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of a national forensic service which is able to serve the needs of the whole country; acknowledges the key role of forensic services and speedy access to evidence for the detection of those responsible for crimes and the prevention of further offences; notes the consultation by the Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA) on a number of options for the future of forensic services in Scotland; believes that the recommendation for the future structure of the service which has now been made by the SPSA Board to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice should be made public immediately; further believes that Option 3, which would result in the closure of the laboratories in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, and that Option 4, which would see their services very significantly reduced, would be detrimental to very many communities in Scotland, and accordingly believes that Option 2 should be the basis on which services are developed.</p>
