<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5536</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Impact of Pfizer&rsquo;s Change of Wholesale Practice on Scottish Pharmacies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals&rsquo; (PGP) proposal to distribute its medicines through a single distribution channel in the United Kingdom; believes that this will damage the pharmaceutical wholesale network in Scotland and will have cost implications for the NHS in Scotland; further believes that this will reduce service levels and be detrimental to patient care in Scotland; is concerned that, if other pharmaceutical manufacturers follow suit, this will further compound the problem by reducing service levels and increasing administrative burdens which will adversely affect the ability of community pharmacists to deliver pharmaceutical care to the people of Scotland, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should seek to persuade PGP to review its decision.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5534</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Howe of Fife Under-18s</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Howe of Fife under-18s on winning the Scottish Rugby Union Youth League Cup, beating Musselburgh 27-14 at Murrayfield; notes that, taken together with the Royal Navy Scottish Schools Sevens in September and the success of Bell Baxter High School in the Scottish Schools Cup, this squad of players has achieved a triple crown in Scottish under-18s rugby; recognises the tremendous achievement of the players, and believes that the contribution to under-18s rugby of the coaching staff of Garry Horne and John Lathangie deserves recognition at the highest level.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christine May<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Tricia Marwick<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5533</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>IPCC - Fourth Assessment Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the first part of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); congratulates the IPCC on its most careful and painstaking examination of the scientific evidence available on climate change; notes the findings of AR4 that by the end of this century average global temperatures are likely to be 1.8&deg;C to 4&deg;C higher than today, with possible rises of up to almost 6&deg;C, leading to rising sea levels and more, and more severe, extreme weather events, including heatwaves, floods, storms and droughts; is reminded that the consensual working practices of the IPCC mean that its reports are extremely conservative and that a more realistic prognosis for the earth&rsquo;s climate is likely to be worse than that set out in the IPCC reports; believes that the publication of the report categorically removes any remaining doubt that climate change is the greatest and most pressing threat facing our planet; echoes the sentiments of Rajendra Pachauri, Chairman of the IPCC, in hoping that &quot;this report will shock people, governments into taking more serious action, as you really can&rsquo;t get a more authentic and a more credible piece of scientific work&quot;, and calls, therefore, for the Scottish Executive to ensure that each and every one of its policies is &quot;climate proofed&quot;, to introduce binding annual greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of at least 3% per annum and to abandon without delay schemes such as the M74 Northern Extension, the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and the Air Route Development Fund which can only contribute to man-made climate change.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5532</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Shadow Round for European Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that over 50 small voluntary sector organisations are being excluded from applying to the recently announced shadow round for European funding in the current year because an arbitrary &pound;200,000 minimum project size has been introduced by ministers; believes that this decision is contrary to the stated policies of the Scottish Executive to encourage and develop the voluntary sector, and asks the Executive to reconsider the decision.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5531</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Save the Simclar Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Simclar Group, based in Irvine, to withdraw from hard-tooling manufacturing, resulting in the effective sacking of 200 permanent and 40 temporary workers; recognises that the Simclar Group is one of Scotland&rsquo;s largest family-owned manufacturing concerns and has operations in Dunfermline in Fife and Kilwinning in North Ayrshire, as well as in Mexico, China and the United States of America, with a worldwide workforce of about 2,200; believes that the decision to sack 240 Scottish workers has been taken, as stated by a Simclar spokesperson, due to the &quot;rising cost of production and relentless market pressure&quot; and is a direct result of the failure of New Labour&rsquo;s economic policies; notes that unemployment in this part of Ayrshire is the highest in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to demand top-level talks with the Simclar Group to convince it to reverse its unacceptable decision, to lobby New Labour in Westminster to bring redundancy payments and other legislation designed to protect workers&rsquo; rights up to at least European-wide standards, to ensure that Simclar uses the statutory 90-day consultation period to try to find suitable alternative employment for its workers in the local area and to do everything in its power to minimise compulsory redundancies and to establish a task force in the local area to support the Simclar workers and regenerate the Ayrshire economy with sustainable long-term manufacturing jobs.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5519#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Time to Act</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that, despite the many advances made in ending discrimination, removing barriers and creating opportunities for people with disabilities and learning difficulties, the recent tragic accident in Glasgow, where a girl with learning difficulties threw herself in front of a train after reportedly being bullied and treated without due regard to her condition by staff and management at her work, highlights the need to initiate a parliamentary debate into the need for support systems, such as buddy systems which have been highly effective elsewhere, to be introduced in the workplace and for companies to be required to implement specific policies and training to ensure that tragic accidents like this are avoided.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5500</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Action on Positional Plagiocephaly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the growth in the number of reported cases of positional plagiocephaly in babies in Scotland since 1995; acknowledges that this cranial disorder, which makes the back or side of a baby&rsquo;s head appear flattened, is mainly caused by outside pressure placed on the skull and is generally associated with the prolonged periods of time that babies can spend with their heads resting in one position; accepts that the increasing incidence of the disorder has been linked to the success of parental guidance on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), urging parents to place babies on their backs to sleep; recognises that early interventions are possible to prevent or correct plagiocephaly which, most importantly, do not negate the significance of the SIDS advice; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s action to develop, with NHS Health Scotland, a leaflet to advise new parents of these interventions, and believes, however, that this action should be supplemented with properly constituted research into the treatment of this condition, including the potential use of cranial remoulding orthoses, and more detailed guidance for NHS staff, particularly at primary care level, to allow for more timely diagnosis and treatment of positional plagiocephaly.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5425#</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>School Transport Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that current legislation regarding the provision of seatbelts on school transport does not require all school buses to be fitted with seatbelt facilities; further notes that the mandatory fitting of seatbelts on school buses only applies to those vehicles first used on or after 1 October 2001 or those manufactured six months before that date; recognises that this loophole can result in children&rsquo;s safety being jeopardised, as was experienced at a recent accident in Aberdeenshire, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Department for Transport in order to have legislation amended so that all school buses, regardless of age and size, are fitted with adequate seatbelt facilities.</p>
