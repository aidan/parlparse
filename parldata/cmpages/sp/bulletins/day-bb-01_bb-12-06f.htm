          <p><strong>*S1M-2525#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil: Railtrack 
            and the Gourock Project</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with dismay 
            the decision by Railtrack plc not to support four Scottish Executive 
            funded enhancement projects, including the project at Gourock train 
            station; recognises that this decision has a particular impact on 
            the Gourock project as it jeopardises the future of the joint capital 
            project between Railtrack, the Scottish Executive, Inverclyde Council 
            and private companies to redevelop the Gourock waterfront; further 
            notes that this project, which would include an integrated transport 
            hub, offers substantial benefits to the Inverclyde economy, and asks 
            Railtrack, as a matter of urgency, to reconsider this short-sighted 
            decision before the project is lost and the people of Inverclyde are 
            robbed of a major economic opportunity. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2524</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Scottish Local 
            Government (Elections) Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">agrees 
            that the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill be passed.</a></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2520.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Improving Scotland's 
            Youth Justice System to Build Safer Communities</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
            to motion (S1M-2520) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from 
            &quot;the importance&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the children&#146;s 
            hearing system with the limited disposals currently available is impotent 
            to deal with persistent and serious offenders; recognises the importance 
            of early intervention measures, of youth work and of increased sports, 
            leisure and educational opportunities in enabling all young people 
            to fulfil their potential and to steering many young people at risk 
            of offending away from a life of crime; welcomes the proposals to 
            achieve these objectives including (a) mapping the coverage and effectiveness 
            of community-based programmes to tackle persistent offending, (b) 
            using the partnership opportunities provided by the multi-agency youth 
            justice teams to develop more systematic early intervention measures 
            and to improve the quality of information provided to the children&#146;s 
            hearing about the offending behaviour and how re-offending could be 
            prevented and (c) identifying how restorative justice approaches can 
            prevent the offender re-offending and build the confidence of victims 
            in our youth justice system and increase the safety of communities, 
            and further calls upon the Scottish Executive to review the powers 
            of the children&#146;s hearing system.&quot; </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2520.2</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Improving Scotland's 
            Youth Justice System to Build Safer Communities</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
            to motion (S1M-2520) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end 
            &quot;; calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement in full the 
            recommendations of the Advisory Group Report on Youth Crime Review, 
            focussing particularly on the proposed national strategy and the review 
            of the age of criminal responsibility; notes the crisis in the recruitment 
            of social workers for children and family services, and, given that 
            the problem of youth crime needs to be seen in the wider context of 
            social justice and in order to measure progress, further calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to bring forward an annual report to the Parliament 
            on the status of all of Scotland&#146;s vulnerable children. </p>
