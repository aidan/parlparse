<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&#117;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-697</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Support for Democracy and Freedom in Burma</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes representatives of the opposition movement in Burma to the Scottish Parliament; expresses its support for their campaign for freedom, justice and democracy in Burma; believes that all countries that share those values should put maximum pressure on the army generals at the head of the Burmese regime; notes that Burma has been heavily criticised by the United Nations for its crackdown on anti-government protests last month and the deaths and suffering caused to unarmed civilians; is therefore outraged that the First Minister of Scotland&rsquo;s most recent communication with the Burmese junta has been to ask for its help and support for his campaign for observer status at the United Nations; further believes that the First Minister could have avoided this shocking situation if he had followed the agreed concordat with the Foreign Office and had discussed his letter to Burma with it before the letter was sent, and furthermore places itself firmly on the side of the protestors in Burma and condemns the junta, all that it stands for and any attempts from the First Minister to seek favour with it.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-696</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Chemistry Week 2007: 3 to 11 November</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the initiative of the Royal Society of Chemistry in organising Chemistry Week 2007, including an event at the Glasgow Science Centre on the theme of Fuelling the Future; recognises the importance of the chemical sciences in tackling many of the challenges that face us, such as developing alternative fuels for transport, and hopes that initiatives such as Chemistry Week will encourage more young people to study chemistry at schools, colleges and universities and will inform the public in general of some of the exciting research that is currently being developed through the chemical sciences.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-695</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Changing Lives</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Robert Keys, from Glasgow, on his award as winner of the ProjectScotland Volunteer of the Year award in the arts and culture category; notes that Robert has overcome a number of difficulties and challenges in his life to become a great example and positive role model for other disadvantaged youngsters, and acknowledges the positive work done by ProjectScotland and other voluntary service organisations in helping those previously excluded from participating fully in society to realise their true potential and aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-694</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>BLISS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the report into neonatal services in Scotland, <em>Small babies, short changed?</em> by BLISS, the premature baby charity, at the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday 31 October 2007; agrees that babies born too sick or too soon to cope on their own should receive the best start; notes the report&rsquo;s findings that 200 extra neonatal nurses are needed to meet standards recommended by the British Association for Perinatal Medicine, and urges the Scottish Government to support the NHS in achieving the best possible care for sick and premature babies.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-693</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Government Rejection of New Station for Plains</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of transport minister, Stewart Stevenson MSP, not to fulfil the commitment of the previous administration to enable the construction of a new train station at Plains, as part of the Airdrie to Bathgate rail link; notes that, during the previous session, the proposals received the backing of the Local Government and Transport Committee and the endorsement of the Scottish Executive; recognises that there is overwhelming support from the people of Plains for a new station to be built and that a direct link into the Airdrie-Bathgate line would make a real difference to local people, allowing them access to educational, employment, recreational and cultural opportunities that are presently out of reach, and believes that the will of the Parliament should prevail and that this decision not to proceed should be reconsidered as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-692</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Human Papilloma Virus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to introduce a vaccination programme against the most dangerous strains of human papilloma virus (HPV); understands that sexually transmitted HPV is extremely common among men and women in the United Kingdom and has been found to cause 75% of cervical cancers and 90% of the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection in clinics in Scotland, genital warts; supports the assurances given on the future vaccination of girls aged between 12 and 13 years and recognises that there are discussions surrounding a catch-up programme for young women up to the age of 16; further recognises that trials are ongoing on the vaccine&rsquo;s efficacy in protecting men from a range of cancers; acknowledges the potential benefits which the vaccination of young men could bring in terms of both improving men&rsquo;s health in Scotland and of cost savings for the NHS in genito-urinary medicine and cancer treatment, and urges ministers to consider fully these factors when determining the shape of Scotland&rsquo;s vaccination programme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-691</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-690</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>East Fife Male Voice Choir</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the East Fife Male Voice Choir which celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2007; recognises the contribution it makes in raising funds for local charities, and looks forward to welcoming the choir to the Parliament on Wednesday 31 October 2007 for a concert in the Garden Lobby.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-689</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Highest Ever FIFA Ranking</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish football team in achieving its highest ever FIFA ranking of 13th place; is delighted that if the team retains its current position it will be in the second group of seeds for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, and joins the rest of the country in wishing the team every success for its final Euro 2008 qualifier on 17 November 2007 against Italy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-688</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Drink Drive Limit Reduction</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the needless loss of life on Scotland&rsquo;s roads each year due to drink driving; notes that the United Kingdom is now one of only four EU member states that have an 80mg per 100ml of blood drink driving limit; believes that a reduction in the legal drink drive limit to 50mg per 100ml of blood would save many lives; acknowledges that reducing the limit is not currently a devolved power and that implementation would require either legislation at Westminster or devolution of power to the Scottish Parliament; recognises that, in order for the reduction to have maximum impact, a considerable media and enforcement campaign would be required, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to take appropriate measures to reduce the drink driving limit for Scotland, in line with the majority of our European counterparts.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-687</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Not for Sale</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conference entitled Challenging Demand, organised by the Women&rsquo;s Support Project, that explores the issue of commercial sexual exploitation; welcomes to Scotland Professor Gail Dines and Dr Rebecca Whisnant, two visiting American academics, who are addressing the conference; believes that prostitution and pornography are part of the continuum of violence against women and are predicated on gender inequality and a perception of women&rsquo;s subordination; further believes that the Parliament should take whatever action is necessary to challenge the demand for women&rsquo;s bodies to be traded for men&rsquo;s sexual gratification; urges the Scottish Government to provide better funding to allow exploited women to have their voices heard, and sends out a clear message that women in Scotland are &quot;Not for Sale.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-642</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore for the work they have done to increase global understanding of climate change and to promote an urgent political response; welcomes the decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Nobel Peace Prize jointly to the IPCC and Mr Gore; recognises that climate change poses an immediate and urgent threat to billions of human beings, to the earth&rsquo;s biodiversity and to the world economy; commits to redoubling the effort in Scotland on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and recognises that this will not happen by targets alone but by fundamental and lasting change in the values of our society, the operation of our economy and the nature of our politics.</p>
<p>Supported by: Rhoda Grant<strong>*</strong>, Jack McConnell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-642.1</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-642) in the name of Patrick Harvie, insert at end &quot;believes, however, that the public is becoming increasingly scunnered at being lectured on the need to make personal sacrifices for the sake of the planet by actors, singers and former US presidential hopefuls who are seen to minimise their own tax contributions towards global warming by the expedient of having offshore accounts and highly skilled tax advisors, fly across the world on private jets, own a number of large properties in different parts of the globe, are driven around in gas-guzzling limousines and who have a correspondingly large carbon footprint; believes that cynicism on the need to make lifestyle choices would be tempered if the public saw celebrities and high-profile former politicians actually lead from the front on this issue rather than preach to everyone else; recognises that green politics can be seen as a way of extorting higher taxation from the public, rather than for improving the environment, and urges greater transparency in ensuring that revenues raised are actually invested in projects that directly counter global warming.&quot;</p>
