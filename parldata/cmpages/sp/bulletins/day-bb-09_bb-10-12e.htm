<p><strong>S3W-28149</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many licences it issued for the control of ravens in each six month period from 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2009, broken down by (a) local authority area and (b) number of ravens covered by each licence.</p>

<p><strong>S3W-28153</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the Chief Constable of Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary&rsquo;s comments to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 that it may not be possible to maintain police officer numbers at current levels through 2010-11 (<em>Official Report</em> c. 2265)<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>S3W-28154</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the comment of the Chief Constable of Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 in relation to maintaining officer numbers through 2010-11 that &quot;every force will have looked at profiles of what it might mean if budgets are not at the level that is hoped for&quot; (<em>Official Report </em>c. 2265)<em>,</em> whether it considers that this may mean a reduction in officer numbers in some forces.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28155</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the comment of the Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 that maintaining police officer numbers at current levels would result in support staff redundancies (<em>Official Report</em> c. 2270)<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>S3W-28156</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the comments of the Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 in relation to possible staff redundancies that &quot;I am afraid that I take a fairly clear position on that. The public want to see police officers; therefore, we would turn first to the police support staff for voluntary redundancies&quot; (<em>Official Report</em> c. 2271)<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>S3W-28157</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the comments of the Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 in relation to possible staff redundancies that &quot;at some point, if we could not balance the books, we would have to consider compulsory redundancies. I would look to shrink the police staff numbers before I shrunk police officer numbers&quot; (<em>Official </em>Report c. 2271) and those of Dave Watson of Unison that the focus on police numbers is the wrong one (<em>Official Report</em> c. 2283)<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>S3W-28158</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that any reduction in police staff numbers as described by the Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 would impact on the roles carried out by police officers and is likely to negatively impact on the length of time that officers can dedicate to frontline policing (<em>Official Report</em> c. 2271) .</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28159</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the comments of Calum Steele of the Scottish Police Federation to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 that &quot;the fundamental duty of any Government must be the safety and security of the public. My fairly simple position is that cuts in funding are simply wrong&quot; (<em>Official Report</em> c. 2284)<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>S3W-28160</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the comments of John Speed of the Prison Officers Association to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 concerning a reduction in frontline prison staff that he stated has a massive impact on the health and safety of prison officers; whether it intends to take action and, if so, what action (<em>Official Report</em> c. 2285).</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28161</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the impact that (a) overcrowding and (b) reduced prison officer numbers is having on the safety of prison officers.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28162</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the comments of Ken Ross of the Fire Brigades Union to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 that the effect of removing ringfencing for the fire service has led to the fire service having to &quot;horse trade with other services to get the necessary funding, which is compromising the security of front-line services&quot; <em>(Official Report </em>c. 2286)<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>S3W-28163</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is concerned at the comments of Ken Ross of the Fire Brigades Union to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 that the COSLA was unable to tell the fire service &quot;what formula or criteria it was using to determine the allocation that the fire service was going to get&quot; and that &quot;it seems that there is no longer a clear and transparent set of criteria for setting fire and rescue service budgets&quot; <em>(Official Report</em> c. 2286) and, if so, what action it will take<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>S3W-28164</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the comments of Ken Ross of the Fire Brigades Union to the Justice Committee on 6 October 2009 that &quot;our priority is to ensure that at the very least the number of firefighters on the front line is maintained if not increased. That can be done by redirecting funding to the front line from other areas where we see duplication and waste&quot; (<em>Official Report</em> c. 2295).</p>
<p><strong>S3W-28165</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will commit to (a) maintaining or (b) increasing the number of firefighters on the front line in the future years.</p>
