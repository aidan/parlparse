That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an "R".</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-3173</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Fair Trade for Scottish Dairy Farmers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports farmers who have been driven to the point where they feel that their only chance of getting a fair price for milk is to engage in direct action protest; notes the loss of 700 dairy farms in the last five years in Scotland; further notes that the profit levels of the big four supermarkets, who control 80% of grocery trade, now amount to Tesco - &pound;2.03 billion, Morrisons - &pound;281 million, Sainsburys - &pound;254 million and Asda/Wal-mart - $10.3 billion worldwide; recognises the failure of the Office of Fair Trading to intervene to ensure fair trade; repeats its call for a stronger code of practice or regulation throughout the food supply chain to control unfair trading practices, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make a statement as a matter of urgency on what it intends to do to help the remaining dairy farmers and protect rural Scotland from further decline.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3172</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Support for an Independent Inquiry Into the Killing of Jean Charles de Menezes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is extremely concerned to note the contents of the leaked documents relating to the Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation into the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes by persons under the command of the Metropolitan Police; is alarmed at the gross disparity between those details and those circulated by police in the immediate aftermath of the shooting; considers that there is such disparity that the veracity of the command structures of the police is in serious doubt and that confidence in the police to assume innocence until guilt is proven and to treat people accordingly has been seriously undermined; supports the de Menezes family in their pursuit for truth and justice and call for a full, open, independent inquiry, and believes that a criminal investigation must take place, as it would in any other case where a person is shot down in cold blood by individuals who are not employed by the state.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3171#</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Victims Rights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes recent court decisions which put the human rights of prisoners before those of their victims by ignoring the rights of victims to pursue their assailant for damages when compensation is awarded and believes that the Scottish Executive should pursue all avenues to ensure that no convicted criminal has the opportunity to gain financially from their crimes or imprisonment and that victims should be advised of awards of compensation, inheritance or other financial gain.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3170</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to "Best Company"</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Livingston-based company, W L Gore &amp; Associates, for coming top of the 2005 <em>Sunday Times </em>&quot;Best Companies to Work For&quot; list; notes that this is the second year in a row that it has been top of this list and that this is the first time that a company has achieved this; commends the company as an example of what can be achieved by good working practices and innovative thinking, and believes that more companies should follow its example.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3169#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Welcome to Glasgow&rsquo;s 2014 Commonwealth Games Bid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes and supports Glasgow&rsquo;s bid to bring the 2014 Commonwealth Games to the city; believes that it can only be beneficial to Scots of all ages, and our youth in particular, to have access to new and enhanced sporting facilities; expects that an upgraded Hampden Park will be utilised as the focal point for the athletics and showcasing of the games; believes that the Scottish Executive should provide the significant bulk of funding for the built infrastructure required for the games, and considers that a successful Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games will further the growing national confidence of the Scottish people.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3168</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Sculpture for Women of Suffrage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s decision to commission a sculpture in recognition of the achievements of women of suffrage and other women in Scotland who have contributed to votes for women and the advancement of democracy generally, particularly in this Parliament with some 40% representation of women as MSPs, and considers that this recognition is long overdue and may give inspiration to women elsewhere who still struggle for these rights.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3167</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Prestwick Airport&rsquo;s 70th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2005 marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Prestwick Airport by the Scottish aviation pioneers David McIntyre and the Duke of Hamilton; recognises that throughout its history the airport has played a leading role in civil and military aviation and in the Scottish aircraft manufacturing industry, and notes the vital role that Prestwick Airport currently plays in the Ayrshire economy, both as a thriving passenger and freight airport and as a base for engineering industries.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3166</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>A Commonwealth Games Lottery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament conveys its best wishes to the team put in place to secure the 2014 Commonwealth Games for Glasgow and lends the weight of its full support behind the bid; believes that a successful bid would be in the interests of Scotland in terms of tourism, economy and the boost to Scottish sport and national self-confidence that hosting such a major event would bring, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government either for the creation of a new Commonwealth Games lottery game or to make the newly created Olympic lottery game a joint Olympics and Commonwealth lottery game, to assist with funding the creation of the necessary infrastructure for the 2014 games in the event that Glasgow&rsquo;s bid is successful.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3165</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Investing Scotland&rsquo;s Oil Revenues</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that after 30 years when &pound;200 billion of revenues from North Sea oil have gone to the Treasury in London, it is now high time that revenues from oil and gas in the Scottish sector of the North Sea came under the control of the Scottish Parliament and further believes that, with world oil prices now over $60 a barrel, the monthly revenues of &pound;1 billion could be better used to invest in Scotland&rsquo;s people, economy and infrastructure, rather than being wasted by the British government to fill the black hole in UK public finances.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3164</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Solidarity With Gate Gourmet Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled at the actions of Gate Gourmet, who summarily sacked 800 people, mostly women and all low paid; believes that the company displayed the worst example of big business putting profit before people; condemns its callous treatment of its workers; further believes that all the sacked workers should be reinstated immediately without loss of pay and that the company should conduct meaningful discussions with the trade unions; sends solidarity to all the sacked workers, their families, supporters and trade union colleagues; congratulates the workers based at Heathrow airport for their solidarity action; believes that the subsequent disruption was a direct result of the actions of Gate Gourmet and that that is where the blame should be placed; regrets that such solidarity action is illegal only because Thatcher&rsquo;s anti-union laws are still on the statute book eight years after Labour came into power, and considers that these laws give a stacked deck of cards to already powerful corporate bullies and should be abolished.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3163</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Glasgow&rsquo;s Bid for Commonwealth Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s decision to back Glasgow&rsquo;s bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games; notes the research into the feasibility of the bid which suggests there are significant regeneration opportunities for Glasgow, including 1,000 jobs, 4% growth in tourism and the development of new and upgraded sports facilities; further notes that the 6,000 athletes who compete would be housed in 1,500 residential units which would be used for social rented and private housing after the games; believes that a successful bid will also bring social change across the city and opportunities to promote sporting excellence across Glasgow, particularly to our young people to engage them in sports and activities they might otherwise never enjoy; further believes that it will also help us tackle ill-health across the city by encouraging everyone to participate in regular exercise and take other healthy lifestyle actions, and considers that a successful bid will also bring benefit to the wider Scottish economy, Scottish sport and the population of Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3162#</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Role of Firefighters in Remote and Rural Areas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the excellent work and invaluable role carried out by those firefighters in remote and rural parts of Scotland on the retained duty system but acknowledges the chronic shortage of such firefighters in some Scottish towns; notes that figures published by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Chief Inspector of Fire Services in Scotland in 2003-04 show levels of retained staff in Scotland running at some 30% below the authorised establishment; considers that these staffing shortages place considerable strain on existing retained staff to support their local communities, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider innovative ways in which businesses could support recruitment into the retained sector and undertake to examine new mechanisms to encourage businesses and the self-employed to understand the benefits of releasing staff to perform the role of retained firefighters in their communities.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3161</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the decision of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to defer its final assessment on the recommendation to not use donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine in the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; acknowledges the continued uncertainty and concern that this position is causing the families of Alzheimer&rsquo;s sufferers in Scotland; is aware that there are 62,000 sufferers of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in Scotland and that a significant proportion of these people are currently being prescribed these drugs; accepts that the drugs are widely available in the United States of America and across the rest of Europe to successfully treat Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; recognises that devolution offers the opportunity to act differently in Scotland; is aware that the final decision on whether to continue prescribing these drugs in Scotland rests with NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS), and therefore urges NHS QIS to reject the NICE proposals and allow Alzheimer&rsquo;s sufferers in Scotland to continue to benefit from the positive, proven effects of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine on the treatment of their condition.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3160#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Keep Studio 24 Open</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the success of Franz Ferdinand and many other Scottish indie bands, highlighted in a Members&rsquo; Business debate last year; notes the importance of music venues in providing a platform for bands to establish themselves; is concerned at the decline in the numbers of such venues in Scotland; compliments Glasgow on its success in supporting a variety of different venues; notes with concern the recent announcement that The Venue on Calton Road in Edinburgh is to be closed and converted to flats and that La Belle Angele and other venues in Edinburgh&rsquo;s Cowgate have yet to be replaced, despite the fact that the fire which devastated them took place almost three years ago; believes that the future of Studio 24, also on Calton Road, must be secured to ensure the future of live music in Edinburgh, and believes that all local authorities in Scotland should consider how they can help support live music through support for new and existing venues, in particular by resisting planning applications that will affect live music venues.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3159</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Gilmerton Field Archery Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the members of Gilmerton Field Archery Club of South Edinburgh on their magnificent performance at the European Field Archery Championship in Estonia where they won seven gold medals, three silver and one bronze and set two European records; recognises that their participation in major events such as this is dependent on the club&rsquo;s own fundraising; supports their attempts to find sponsorship for defence of their titles in Finland next year and to compete in the World Field Archery Championship in Australia, and wishes them well at the Scottish Field Archery Championship in Innerleithen later this month where archers from throughout Scotland will compete.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3158</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Quincentenary of Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Christ&rsquo;s College, University of Cambridge, the college of John Milton and Charles Darwin, on the quincentenary of its foundation; notes the close links that have existed for many years between the college and Scotland; celebrates the contributions made to the college by eminent Scots as exemplified by Lord Todd of Trumpington, who was simultaneously Master of Christ&rsquo;s and Founding Chancellor of the University of Strathclyde; celebrates the contributions made to scholarship, teaching and research in Scotland by members of Christ&rsquo;s, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that all young people in Scotland are afforded the opportunity to study at the institution most suited to their skills and talents, regardless of where in the United Kingdom it might be.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3157</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle:</strong> <strong>Green Power Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament backs recent moves to create a major biomass development at the Tullis Russell paper mill in Fife which could use up to 700,000 tonnes of fuel crops, including willow chippings, for a heat and electricity generating plant; further supports the fact that this could be a major boost for local farmers who may be able to grow willow coppice to support the plant; notes that renewable energy in Scotland will take a big leap forward with this major project and that it widens the range of renewable energy projects in Scotland, and recognises that farming is going through tough times with many enterprises not recovering their costs of production and that Scottish agriculture will benefit greatly from this development.</p>
