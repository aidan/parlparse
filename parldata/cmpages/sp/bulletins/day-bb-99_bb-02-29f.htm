    the Parliament agrees to abandon the Holyrood project and properly reappraise all
    alternative options for our new Parliament complex, including Glasgow, and that the budget

    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><a name="601"></a>*S1M-601#</b> <strong>Bill Aitken: Bus Corridors in Glasgow</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the concerns of businesses in Glasgow about the effects of bus
    corridors on the main arterial routes in and out of the city on local businesses, and
    believes that the local authority should give the fullest possible consideration to the
    views of small businesses prior to the imposition of these schemes, in view of the
    potential adverse consequences on employment.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><a name="600"></a>*S1M-600</b> <strong>Christine Grahame: Scottish Borders
    Economy</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with regret that the lowest level of wages in
    Scotland is in the Scottish Borders, an area hit by a series of mass redundancies;
    recognises that action is needed at a Scottish and UK level to bring more investment into
    the area; further notes the fragile nature of the textiles and farming industries and,
    recognising that low wages leads to low morale, invites the Scottish Executive to redouble
    its efforts to bring new, sustainable and quality jobs to the Scottish Borders.</p>
