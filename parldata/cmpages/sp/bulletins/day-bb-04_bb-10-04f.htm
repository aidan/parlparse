          <P><strong>*S2M-1820</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Waste Recycling at Holyrood</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the lack of recycling facilities available within the new Holyrood complex; is further concerned that a new building which accommodates an Executive dedicated to addressing Scotland&rsquo;s waste problems had no recycling facilities installed as a matter of course, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to install proper recycling facilities for all paper, plastic, tin and glass waste as a matter of urgency.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1819</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill - Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure or increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in Rule 9.12.3(b)(ii) or (iii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</P>

Since his appointment there has been no increase in capacity in Lothian &hellip; [and that] In the last 18 months we have been forced to send 50 urology patients to the private sector for surgery&quot;; notes that these conditions alone have cost the BGH &pound;200,000; notes that Mr O&rsquo;Neill goes on to state that &quot;in a recent review of SCAN, GPs&rsquo; views of cancer services urology received the lowest rating of all cancer services with the Borders service receiving particular criticism, particularly in relation to waiting times&quot;; further notes that Mr Mitchell has now resigned because of the lack of progress being made and that NHS Borders has been told that it will have no access to any lists or clinics in Lothian and that &quot;We (BGH) are therefore facing a crisis in provision of urological services for the Borders region&quot;; notes that there are currently 121 in-patients awaiting admission for surgery, 30 of whom have waited between six and nine months, that 28 patients are awaiting prostatic biopsies for suspected cancer and that some of those have been waiting more than seven months and that 92 out-patients are awaiting appointments, and asserts that this is wholly unacceptable and that the Scottish Executive should intervene on all these matters so that an acceptable service can be accessed by Borders patients.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1785</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Declaration on the Occasion of the Royal Opening of the Scottish Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls for an independent Scottish republic built on the principles of liberty, equality, diversity and solidarity; believes that these principles can never be put into practice while Scotland remains subordinate to the hierarchical and anti-democratic institutions of the British state; believes that these principles can be brought about by a freely-elected Scottish government with full control of Scotland&rsquo;s revenues; believes that the right to self-determination is an inherent right, and not a favour to be granted, whether by the Crown or the British state; believes that sovereignty rests with the people and vows to fight for the right of the people to govern themselves for the benefit of all those living in Scotland today, tomorrow and in future times; further believes that the government of a country is the servant to the people, not master of the people; believes that a written constitution would guarantee, under law, everyone&rsquo;s right to freely vote, speak and assemble and would guarantee the people&rsquo;s right to privacy and protection and access to information on all of the government&rsquo;s actions; vows to fight for the power to refuse to send our sons and daughters to kill and die in unjust wars in foreign lands and to fight for the power to banish nuclear weapons of mass destruction from our land; vows to fight for the power to acquire and restrict the use of property or lands controlled by individuals, corporations or governments beyond Scotland&rsquo;s borders; vows to fight for the power to build a more equal society, free of poverty, through the redistribution of our vast wealth; vows to fight for the power to protect our soil, seas and rivers for our children and for the generations to come; swears to oppose all forms of national chauvinism, imperialism and racism, to oppose all forms of discrimination on the grounds of gender, ethnic origin, religion, place of birth, age, disability, sexuality or language; aims to fight for an independent Scottish republic in which people may live with dignity and with self-respect, free from exploitation and assuming the responsibilities of free women and men, and which will negotiate freely and as an equal with governments of other lands; affirms that its aim is not to erect walls of separation, but to build an outward-looking Scotland that will extend the hand of friendship to all the peoples of the world, and vows to continue the struggle for a free, democratic Scottish republic for as long as it may take as our fight is for freedom.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1761</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>World Alzheimer&rsquo;s Day 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 21 September 2004 was World Alzheimer&rsquo;s Day; notes that some 62,000 people in Scotland have dementia and that the number grows as the population ages; notes that, according to Alzheimer&rsquo;s Scotland, the status quo is not an option and that changes need to be made to health and community care services to ensure that both sufferers and their families, who are often unpaid carers, are properly supported; notes that the direct costs of this disease are substantially greater than strokes, heart disease and cancer but that expenditure on research does not reflect this, and believes that the Scottish Executive should therefore increase research funding into the causes, and possible treatments, of dementia and should ensure that proper systems are in place to identify, fund and support carers.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1759</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Meals on Wheels: A Vital Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the withdrawal of the meals on wheels service in the Scottish Borders, replacing it with a fortnightly delivery of frozen food; notes that carers, elderly people, consultants and other nursing staff at the Borders General Hospital Medical Services Directorate&rsquo;s Department of Medicine for the Elderly have stated that stopping the service will result in a deterioration in elderly care in the Borders; deplores the fact that this practice has been adopted elsewhere in Scotland; notes that, although microwaves and freezers are provided where necessary, there are many frail and elderly who cannot cope with these gadgets, which may result in food being undercooked, running the risk of food poisoning; further notes that vital, often daily, human contact with the volunteers delivering the meals, sometimes the only human contact elderly people have in the day and a contact that at times has been life-saving, will be lost, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to require local authorities who have adopted this procedure to reinstate the meals on wheels service to those frail and elderly people who request it, giving them the dignity of choice which all Scottish citizens deserve.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-1706#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Closure of Public Telephone Boxes by BT</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the value of public telephone boxes as an important public service throughout Scotland in terms of social need and access to emergency services; is concerned about the plans by British Telecom (BT) to close 165 call boxes in towns and villages throughout mid-Scotland and Fife and around 1,000 around Scotland; supports the many community councils who have expressed grave concern at the planned closure of public call boxes in their communities; considers the consultation process conducted by BT to be inadequate, and therefore believes that BT should consult directly with the communities affected and reconsider its plans.</P>

          <P><strong>*S2M-1706.1#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Closure of Public Telephone Boxes by BT</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1706) in the name of Bruce Crawford, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;takes cognisance of the current BT Scotland review of public payphones and its consultation process with local communities and customers over plans to remove little-used phone boxes; recognises that, with the huge increase in mobile phone take-up, there has been a consequent reduction in payphone usage; is concerned that the consultation process should be as robust as possible, taking into account local community views on the social need of such public telephone boxes, particularly where arguments are made for their retention and that the needs of those customers in deprived areas whose only access to a telephone is via a payphone is an important criterion in the consideration to remove a box; considers that those payphones in remote rural areas, such as parts of the Stirling constituency, where boxes may provide an emergency lifeline for groups like drivers and walkers during the winter period, or where there is poor mobile phone reception, should be given special consideration; shares concerns about communication problems over the consultation process, and believes that BT Scotland should not remove any public telephone box where there is a social need or safety aspect in doing so.&quot;</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1406#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Reserved Contracts to Support Remploy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the work of Remploy in Scotland in supporting 700 people with special needs in employment and congratulates the organisation on its training and development programme which has seen the creation of dedicated learning rooms at all 10 of its employment sites, with 275 employees currently undertaking skills training in language and mathematics and a further 135 involved in other learning activity, and a commitment of at least 5% of working time over a year to be dedicated to personal development; notes that this programme has been implemented in just over two years, and believes that the Scottish Executive and all publicly-funded organisations should examine their procurement policies with a view to reserving contracts for supported employment organisations such as those working with Remploy.</P>
