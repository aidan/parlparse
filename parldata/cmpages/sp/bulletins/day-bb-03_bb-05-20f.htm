          <p><strong>*S2M-41</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Chernobyl Children 
            Life Line</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the invaluable 
            work of Chernobyl Children Life Line, formed to help the children 
            of Belarus after the Chernobyl nuclear power station disaster of April 
            1986 when 70% of the fall-out from the station landed in Belarus; 
            notes that the aim of the charity, through Britain-wide links, the 
            first being formed in 1992, is to bring children from Belarus in small 
            groups and with an interpreter to the United Kingdom for one month 
            to live with host families and that, simply by having this one month 
            away, their immune systems are boosted extending their period of good 
            health; further notes that this year 10 children will be in Scotland 
            from 18 June to 16 July with 12 host families from Haddington, Romanno 
            Bridge, West Linton and Penicuik, as well as Linlithgow, Bonnyrigg, 
            Pencaitland, Kirkliston and Edinburgh; wishes the host families and 
            the children a happy experience, and commends the work of this charity 
            and its volunteers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-40#</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell: Unfair Milk Prices</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament condemns the Lidl supermarket chain for not signing 
            up to the voluntary supermarket code of conduct in the United Kingdom 
            and considers that Lidl should discontinue actions that drive down 
            the price paid to farms for milk to lower than the cost of production.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-39</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: Advertising in Schools</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament expresses deep concern at the increasing trend for 
            private companies to advertise their brands in schools, hoping for 
            a captive target market of young people who will stay true to their 
            products in later life, often to the detriment of the young people&#146;s 
            nutritional health; believes that Scotland&#146;s schools should be 
            brand-free zones and should not have to rely on the franchises, vouchers 
            or other marketing deals offered by such companies to provide computers 
            or other teaching materials, and calls on the Scottish Executive to 
            engage with local authorities across Scotland to ensure that all advertising 
            and branding is removed from schools and to provide local authorities 
            with sufficient funds to cover all the educational and nutritional 
            needs of Scotland&#146;s schoolchildren.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-38#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Scottish Water Charges</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the dramatic increases in Scottish 
            Water charges to small businesses in the current financial year, which 
            in some cases amount to nearly 500% over the amount charged last year; 
            believes that these increased charges bear no relation to the services 
            provided by Scottish Water to small businesses; is concerned that 
            these dramatic increases represent an unfair burden on many small 
            businesses throughout Scotland and in some cases may threaten their 
            future viability, and further believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should direct Scottish Water to review urgently its charging structure 
            with a view to reducing the costs to business.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-37</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: Support for Scotch 
            Whisky Industry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament considers that all 
            Parliament-related functions where alcohol is available should offer 
            Scotch whisky as an option and notes that by doing so cost advantages 
            can be obtained compared with the current practice of serving foreign 
            wines.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-36</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Reza Garikani</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament condemns the abhorrent treatment of Reza Garikani who 
            is currently detained at Dungavel House immigration removal centre; 
            notes that Mr Garikani was denied private access to his legal representative 
            by Premier Security and, whilst a patient in Hairmyres Hospital, remained 
            handcuffed and chained despite being ill; believes that this is a 
            breach of Mr Garikani's human rights; seeks a full inquiry into the 
            conduct of Premier Security, and agrees that steps should be taken 
            to ensure that such conduct never happens again.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-35</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Scottish Premier 
            League Rules</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            Juventus and AC Milan on reaching the final of Europe's premier club 
            competition, the UEFA Champions League Cup; notes that three of the 
            four competing semi-finalists in the competition share their playing 
            grounds with other clubs; further notes that under current Scottish 
            Premier League (SPL) rules these clubs would not, like Falkirk Football 
            Club, be allowed to play in Scotland's premier league because of the 
            ground sharing rules, and calls on the SPL to review its rules and 
            admit Falkirk Football Club to the premier league with effect from 
            next season as its winning of the Scottish Football League First Division 
            title merits.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-30 Broomhill Day Centre, Penicuik</strong> (lodged on 
            14 May 2003) Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-30.1</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Broomhill 
            Day Centre, Penicuik</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-30) 
            in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out 
            from "and calls" to end and insert "further notes that Midlothian 
            Council only awards annual funding when, for the purposes of forward 
            planning, it is essential that funding is secured on a triennial basis; 
            is aware that the funding comes from the council, the NHS and from 
            grant-making bodies including the Community Fund and the Lloyds TSB 
            Foundation; is concerned that the Lloyds TSB Foundation funding expires 
            in September 2003, thereby reducing financial support by £40,000 and 
            that, if this is not replaced, then the service provided at the centre 
            may have to be reduced from provision for 94 frail elderly people 
            to 40 and staffing cuts will be made; believes that it is essential 
            that day centres such as Broomhill are 100% funded by a partnership 
            of the local authorities and NHS boards which is where Broomhill receives 
            100% of its referrals from, and further believes that, without these 
            changes, Broomhill, an award-winning centre, cannot continue to deliver 
            its invaluable services to frail and elderly people in Penicuik."</p>
