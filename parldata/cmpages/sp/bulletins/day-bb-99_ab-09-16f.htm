            is only one aspect of homelessness and that any initiative designed 
            to tackle it can only deal with the reality of rough sleeping not 
            the causes behind it; calls upon the Scottish Executive to make the 
            newly established Homelessness Taskforce a priority and to bring forward 
            early measures to deal with the causes of homelessness, new regulations 
            to help homeless people and new legislative proposals to bring homelessness

            degradation, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to continue to 
            work to deliver a sustainable, effective and integrated transport 
            system through in particular the Programme of Government commitments 
            on investing in public transport, promoting an national transport 
            timetable and bringing forward a Transport Bill in early 2000 whilst
