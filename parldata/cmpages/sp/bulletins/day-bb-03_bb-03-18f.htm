          <p><strong>*S1M-4030</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Double Ear Tagging 
            of Sheep</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with extreme concern 
            the European Commission&#146;s proposals that Scottish flockmasters 
            should &quot;double ear tag&quot; and record the individual identification 
            numbers of every sheep in the country; further notes that such proposals 
            are impractical, unworkable and unpoliceable on Scotland&#146;s extensive 
            upland and mountain sheep farms and that they would add nothing to 
            the effectiveness of either meat or disease traceability that is not 
            already achieved by current systems of flock identification, and urges 
            the Scottish Executive to work with Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to resist these proposals vigorously as being against the interests 
            of Scotland&#146;s flockmasters.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4029#</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: Community 
            Buyout of the North Harris Estate</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes the historic purchase by the local community of the 55,000 acre 
            North Harris Estate on which the community lives and works; congratulates 
            the community and all involved in this community buy-out; notes that 
            this purchase would not have been possible without the invaluable 
            support from the Land Unit of the Scottish Executive, Her Majesty's 
            Government and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, and wishes both the community 
            and Mr Ian Scarr-Hall, the owner of Amhuinnsuidhe Castle, the very 
            best for the future, as they set about the task of social, economic, 
            cultural and environmental renewal.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4028</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Compensation for 
            Mesothelioma Sufferers</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the urgency of mesothelioma cases and the need to review court procedures 
            and powers in order to identify the real issues in such cases at the 
            earliest possible stage, to minimise delays in order to progress cases, 
            to encourage the use of jury trials and to facilitate interim payments 
            pending the resolution of cases.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4027</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Rights of Trade 
            Unions During War</strong>&#151;That the Parliament defends the right 
            of free trade unions to engage democratically in legitimate industrial 
            action in pursuit of their members' interests and therefore resolves 
            to oppose any move by the Lord Advocate to ban strike action by Scotland's 
            firefighters on Thursday 20 March 2003 or on any other day.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4026</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: The Antonine 
            Wall</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the decision of Historic 
            Scotland to apply for World Heritage Status for the Antonine Wall 
            as part of a joint bid with Austria, Germany and Slovakia that seeks 
            to secure recognition of, and protection for, the remaining sites 
            that mark the boundaries of the Roman Empire; applauds all those who 
            have worked, often against the indifference of Historic Scotland and 
            other bodies, to preserve the signs of, and evidence about, the Roman 
            invasion and occupation of Scotland, and, in particular, salutes the 
            efforts of Ronnie Guild for his Herculean efforts on behalf of the 
            ruins at Cramond and the members of the Antonine Guard for their active 
            concern, in and out of uniform, for the Antonine Wall and other sites.
