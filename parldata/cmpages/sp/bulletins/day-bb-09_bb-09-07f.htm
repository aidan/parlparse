<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4787</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Gaelic School Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of funding for the Glasgow Gaelic School, Sgoil Gh&agrave;idhlig Ghlaschu, which will help to further the progress that has been made in Gaelic-medium education in Glasgow; further congratulates the staff and parents for their dedication in bringing about that success, and also acknowledges the efforts of Glasgow City Council education department in helping to create the largest school in Scotland covering Gaelic nursery, primary and secondary teaching.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4786</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Welcome to Lothian Buses&rsquo; Pink Top</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the responsiveness of Lothian Buses to the needs of its passengers; notes that since 2000 the company has provided easy access buses culminating in an entire fleet of low-floor easy access vehicles, and welcomes the trialling of the pink top service 22, which provides a dedicated unfolded buggy space in addition to wheelchair space thus increasing the travel capacity for disabled passengers and those with young children and folded or unfolded buggies.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4785</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Princes Scottish Youth Business Trust Western Isles Regional Awards 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Sarah Morrison of Stornoway jewellery and accessories business, Rock N&rsquo; Retro, for winning the regional awards of the Princes Scottish Youth Business Trust in the Western Isles; notes that these awards aim to recognise excellence among young businesses; notes also the success and achievements of finalist and runner-up Anna Donachie of Barraheads Salon on the Isle of Barra; looks forward to the future success of Sarah&rsquo;s and Anna&rsquo;s businesses, and wishes Sarah all the best in going on to the national final of the Princes Scottish Youth Business Trust Awards.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4784</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Edinburgh&rsquo;s Climate Challenge Fund Beneficiaries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament heartily congratulates all of the Edinburgh projects that recently received an award from the Climate Challenge Fund, Care and Repair Edinburgh Ltd, Drylaw Neighbourhood Centre, Edinburgh University People and Planet Society and the Grange Association and LifeCare; appreciates that they are among a growing number of community projects across Scotland that are proving to be this country&rsquo;s best source of innovation in tackling climate change; considers that the people behind these projects are true climate pioneers doing work that Scotland can be proud of; acknowledges that, if Scotland is to meet the 42% carbon reduction targets set out by the Parliament last month, it will need to scale up projects like these and learn from their experiences, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue to meet the demand from community groups for this invaluable assistance.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4783</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Waste Aware Scotland-wide</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the reported &pound;1 billion worth of food thrown away in Scotland each year, equating to an average of &pound;550 per year thrown out by each household; notes that over two thirds of what is binned could have been used if it had been stored properly and if meals had been better planned; highlights the work of Golspie Recycling and Environmental Action Network, a community-based social enterprise recycling firm in Sutherland, and other good examples around Scotland that set a benchmark to promote positive community awareness on waste minimisation, and encourages Scottish families and households to be wiser with their waste, one of the many simple ways to reduce their carbon footprints and save money.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4780#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Concessionary Travel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recommendation of the <em>Review of the Scotland Wide Free Bus Travel Scheme for Older and Disabled People </em>to include seriously injured armed forces veterans in the scheme but notes with disappointment and concern the review&rsquo;s recommendation that appears to disenfranchise disabled people who receive the lower rate of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) from the scheme; further notes that the review paints a worst-case scenario of the costs of including disabled people who receive the lower rate of DLA, that the methods used to arrive at these projected costs is questionable and that the review also played down the positive social impact that the scheme has on people&rsquo;s lives; considers that denying disabled people on the lower rate of DLA access to the scheme will damage the main aims and ethos of the scheme, namely to allow disabled people improved access to services, facilities and social networks by free scheduled bus services and so promote social inclusion and improve health by promoting a more active lifestyle for disabled people; notes that previous local schemes operated in Strathclyde and West Lothian provided people on the lower rate of DLA access to concessionary travel schemes and that they supported the national scheme, mirroring its eligibility criteria instead of the stringent criteria that are now adopted; supports disability organisations Leonard Cheshire Disability, Learning Disability Alliance Scotland (LDAS), Inclusion Scotland and many more in challenging the review&rsquo;s negative recommendation; considers that disabled people&rsquo;s views and those of the organisations that represent them should be taken into account, and believes that the recommendation on eligibility contained in the review is unfair and that that the national concessionary travel scheme should include those in receipt of the lower rate of DLA.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4779</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Newly-released Ministry of Defence Documents Indicate Nuclear Risk at Faslane</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern Ministry of Defence internal safety reports regarding the risk of a major nuclear accident at Faslane Naval base, newly released following a freedom of information request by the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament; considers that these reports state that plutonium from up to 48 nuclear warheads could potentially escape and cause widespread contamination and cancers if there was to be an accident while a Trident submarine was being moved by the on-base shiplift facility; further notes with particular concern that in the released reports the numbers regarding how far the contamination could potentially spread, how many cancers it might cause and how probable such an accident may be have been redacted; believes that the content of these reports reveals the gravity of the risk that Trident poses to the Scottish public, and calls on the UK Government to abandon plans to renew what is widely believed to be the irrelevant Trident weapons system and remove all nuclear submarines from Scottish waters.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4748</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Decision on Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decisions by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to reject the application by the Libyan Government to transfer Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi under the prisoner transfer agreement between the United Kingdom and Libya and to release Mr Al Megrahi on compassionate grounds;&nbsp;notes that the decision on compassionate release is in accordance with the recommendations from the Scottish Prison Service and the Parole Board for Scotland, and endorses the decision as being consistent with the principles of Scottish justice.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4748.1</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Decision on Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4748) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from second &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the process of making this crucial decision was mishandled by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice; believes that it was wrong for the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to meet Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi in prison while considering his application for compassionate release to Libya and that this potentially sets an inappropriate precedent; also believes that it was unacceptable that the media was made aware of the decision a week before it was formally announced; does not accept that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice received or sought sufficient medical advice to make his judgement on Megrahi&rsquo;s prognosis; further believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice did not sufficiently explore options to take account of Megrahi&rsquo;s illness other than compassionate release to Libya; recognises that Scotland&rsquo;s international reputation has been damaged not simply by the decision to release Megrahi on compassionate grounds to Libya but also because of the way that taking the decision was mishandled, and, given the mishandling of this process by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, does not agree with his decision to return Megrahi to Libya on compassionate release.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Paul Martin</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4748.1.2</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Decision on Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-4748.1) in the name of Richard Baker, after second &quot;Libya&quot; insert &quot;, in particular the opportunities for compassionate release within Scotland; believes that the announcement should have been made to the Parliament rather than to a press conference; considers that justice and compassion for the victims&rsquo; families have not been served by this process;&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-4748.2</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Decision on Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4748) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, insert at end &quot;further notes that the public concerns that continue to exist about Mr Al Megrahi&rsquo;s case extend to international discussions prior to release, as well as the original conviction, and calls on the UK Government to initiate, as a matter of urgency, a full and wide-ranging public inquiry into all aspects of the case.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4743</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Vale of Leven Community Maternity Unit 24/7</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern regarding the news that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is proposing the mothballing of the Community Maternity Unit at the Vale of Leven Hospital at night; understands that the maternity unit will run normally during the day but be replaced by an on-call service in the evening; considers that this decision effectively downgrades the service and is a blow to a vital resource that midwives have fought so hard to build up and that expectant mothers need available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; further notes that this decision may have an adverse effect on the choices of future expectant mothers who may decide to go to another hospital, and calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to abandon this daft proposal, which appears to be based on the premise that babies are born between the hours of 9 am and 5 pm.</p>
