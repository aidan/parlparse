<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Green Party Business - Young People and Families&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-4999</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Young People and Families</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that children and young people are shaped by their relationships and experiences at home, in their schools and communities, by the physical space they find themselves in and by their economic circumstances; understands the absolute importance of these factors at the centre of healthy development; acknowledges that families and young people need support from time to time and that communities, public services, local authorities and the Scottish Executive share a responsibility to meet this need; regrets, however, that public debate in Scotland has increasingly reduced children and young people to simplistic stereotypes, either as innocents to be protected or as problems to be contained; in particular regrets that the tone of debate on antisocial behaviour has distracted attention and resources from the need to address the wider issues in young people&rsquo;s lives; believes that where problems such as youth disorder have arisen local communities are best placed to decide on the appropriate response; therefore rejects the idea of forcing local authorities to use specific antisocial behaviour measures against their better judgement, and calls on the Executive to develop a comprehensive strategy for supporting families and young people. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-4999.2</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Young People and Families</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4999) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;that children and young people&quot; to end and insert &quot;the vital importance of all young people being able to fulfil their potential; pays tribute to the contribution young people across Scotland make to their families and communities; knows the importance of the family in providing support and guidance for young people; welcomes the fact that child poverty has been reduced by over a quarter in Scotland, that the Scottish Executive has introduced universal nursery education for all three to four-year-olds, that the Executive has seen record levels of investment in schools and teachers, that more of our young people are going on to higher and further education, that youth unemployment is at a record low and that more parents are in work and have access to support and childcare; recognises further that some parents require extra support to bring up children, that decent families and young people need to be safe and protected in their homes and communities, that young people supported by and having access to good quality youth work opportunities have an important role to play in improving their communities, and reiterates the determination of this Parliament to stand up to anti-social behaviour, to end child poverty and to provide every child and young person with the best possible start in life.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-4999.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee: Young People and Families</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4999) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from first &quot;regrets&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the most important duties of the Executive towards young people are to provide them with better opportunities for education and employment, a safe environment with affordable housing in which to live and public services which are efficient and effective, and calls for a greater focus from the Executive on delivering improvements in public services and providing opportunities for young people, families, and everyone else in Scotland.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by </em>Scottish Green Party Business - Climate Change and Road Transport&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-5005</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Climate Change and Road Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes growing public and parliamentary recognition of the threat posed by climate change; notes that cuts in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions of 60% to 90% are necessary to stabilise climate change within a generation; notes that transport, excluding aviation, accounts for 19% of Scotland&rsquo;s climate change emissions, over 97% of which comes from road transport, and that road traffic is predicted to grow a further 27% by 2021; recognises that without reducing traffic levels it will be impossible to reduce Scottish greenhouse gas emissions to a level consistent with the need to address climate change; further recognises the need for urgent political action within the next four years to achieve year-on-year reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to set year-on-year overall greenhouse gas reduction targets and interim targets to reduce road traffic levels. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5005.3</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Climate Change and Road Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5005) in the name of Mark Ballard, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s record investment of 70% of the transport budget in public transport; notes the significant investment in Scotland&rsquo;s bus services, which rely upon a modern road infrastructure, and in the rail network, where the Executive has already opened the Larkhall to Milngavie line, all with the aim of improving the environment; further supports the Executive&rsquo;s investment to reduce road deaths and casualties, improve safety on roads outside schools, and provide attractive, integrated and affordable public transport alternatives, and welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s climate change programme and sustainable development campaign.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5005.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Climate Change and Road Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5005) in the name of Mark Ballard, leave out from &quot;within a generation&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that a range of measures are required to reduce transport emissions, including a clean transport fuels strategy and provision of sustainable alternatives to road transport, and further recognises that the energy sector accounts for the greatest proportion of emissions and that Scotland has enormous potential to develop cleaner and renewable energy to reduce our carbon footprint.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5005.1</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank: Climate Change and Road Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5005) in the name of Mark Ballard, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that, along with global poverty and terrorism, climate change is one of the three greatest challenges facing mankind today and therefore supports David Cameron MP&rsquo;s call for a Climate Change Bill to be included in this year&rsquo;s Queen&rsquo;s Speech to establish year-on-year targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 60% by 2050 and to establish an independent monitor to report to the UK Parliament on Britain&rsquo;s progress in meeting those annual targets and to audit government policy to assess whether we remain on track to hit future targets; acknowledges, however, that ongoing investment in the Scottish road network remains vital for public safety, cutting congestion and to protect both small businesses and remote rural communities in particular; further acknowledges that more must be done to encourage modal shift from road to rail for both passenger and freight traffic, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that those road and rail projects of greatest importance be prioritised for investment, specifically a new Forth crossing, the refurbishment of Waverley Station, the completion of the central belt motorway network and the upgrading of many important trunk routes alongside increased efforts to move more freight from road to rail.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-5008</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Coastal and Marine National Parks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to manage Scotland&rsquo;s coastline and seas in a sustainable way; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s public consultation on proposals to establish Scotland&rsquo;s first Coastal and Marine National Park, and notes that the Executive will take account of the views expressed in response to the consultation before taking decisions on how to progress the proposals. </p>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5008.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Coastal and Marine National Parks</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5008) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that coastal and marine national parks may have a role to play in the future but that at the present time there are many other more pressing priorities facing our coastal communities; further notes that, according to Scottish Environment Link, there are already over 85 Acts of Parliament that apply to Scotland&rsquo;s waters and yet a further layer of bureaucracy would not be helpful or popular and would only add to the existing complexity of marine and coastal management in Scotland; calls for a review of the governance of the marine environment before additional legislation is considered; believes that the creation of coastal and marine national parks should not be considered until other priorities are addressed and there is evidence that there is sufficient demand within local communities, and calls for the Scottish Parliament to have additional powers to help protect and promote our marine environment.&quot; </p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p><strong>S2M-4904</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen&rsquo;s Bid for the National Energy Technologies Institute</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the current and future importance of the energy sector to the north east&rsquo;s economy; recognises that Aberdeen and the north east are home to a unique cluster of skills and expertise in energy exploration and development; notes the success of the Intermediary Technology Institute for Energy which is based in Aberdeen and works closely with the network of intermediary technology institutes throughout Scotland and also sources academic research across the United Kingdom and worldwide; believes that this successful model based in Aberdeen shows that the city has a unique potential to be the hub for a Scottish bid for the UK Energy Technologies Institute; notes both the location of leading oil and gas operators and contractors in Aberdeen and the work of the Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group, and welcomes the efforts to ensure that the UK Energy Technologies Institute is located in Aberdeen so that the north east remains a global leader in the energy industry. </p>
