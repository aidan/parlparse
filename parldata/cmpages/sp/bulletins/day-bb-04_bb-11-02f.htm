          <!-- #BeginEditable "Body text" -->
          <p><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1926</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Last Post</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the threat by the Post Office to close up to half of its main post offices; notes that, in the wake of the closure of large numbers of sub-post offices, this can only compound the damage to communities and to the many individuals, often vulnerable, who rely on the post office service, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government before these key services are lost.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1925</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s agenda for the most comprehensive modernisation programme in Scottish schools for a generation, as described in <em>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</em>, which builds on the investment and success in education over recent years and sets out plans to bring a transformation in ambition and achievement through higher expectations for schools and school leadership, greater freedom for teachers and schools, more choice for pupils and better support for learning so that the individual needs of young people can be better met, and tough, intelligent accountabilities to drive improvement.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1924</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Eco-friendly Architecture</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the entrants and finalists in the annual architectural prize competition organised by the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS); welcomes a secure future for the competition; notes that the judges chose the new school campus at St Aloysius&rsquo; College in Glasgow as a well-deserved winner, but commends the public&rsquo;s choice in an on-line poll of a house constructed of wood for Danish artist Lotte Glob which is sited near Loch Eriboll in Sutherland; commends its design by Aberdeen architect G&ouml;kay Deveci, who lectures in architectural design at the Scott Sutherland School at The Robert Gordon University, and encourages clients throughout Scotland to commission many more eco-friendly designs for homes and workplaces that are made from local materials, in particular from locally-sourced wood from Scottish forests.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1923</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Clean-Up of Contaminated Land</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to initiate an immediate survey of all land surrounding Scotland&rsquo;s nuclear facilities, to make an announcement to the Parliament regarding how the land surrounding Hunterston is to be cleaned up and, in light of the contamination at Hunterston, to demand the immediate closure of all nuclear facilities in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1922</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Yasser Arafat</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its best wishes to Yasser Arafat, the elected leader of the Palestinian people, who is receiving medical treatment in France and condemns the disgraceful and shameful comments of the Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, that he will never allow Mr Arafat to be buried in Jerusalem.</p>
