            Chartered Society of Physiotherapy's Physiotherapy Week from 5 to 
            9 July 2004; notes that 850,000 working days were lost due to musculoskeletal

            physiotherapy in the fight against work-related ill health, and agrees

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1555</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> 
            <strong>New York Introduces Self-Extinguishing Cigarettes</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates New York State on the ban of sales of 
            non-self-extinguishing cigarettes within New York State; appreciates 
            that this measure will help in saving the lives of some of the 900 
            Americans who die each year by fires started by cigarettes left unattended, 
            and, given that smoking-related fires are the most common reason for 
            preventable deaths reported by the Fire Service in Scotland and that 
            under the Scotland Act 1998 this issue is reserved to Westminster, 
            urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's 
            Government to introduce similar legislation in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1554</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Protection 
            of Scotland's Coasts</strong>-That the Parliament notes the first 
            anniversary of the sinking of the <em>MV Jambo</em> in the Minch; 
            regrets the failure to protect one of Scotland's most important and 
            fragile marine areas and regards the overall protection of Scotland's 
            coasts as inadequate; calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce 
            further measures to ensure the conservation and protection of Scotland's 
            marine environment and to that all the recommendations of the Donaldson 
            report which followed the Braer disaster are fully implemented, and 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to give further consideration to the 
            appointment of a dedicated minister for the marine environment to 
            deliver coherent government action on the seas.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1553</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Iraq 
            Remains Occupied</strong>-That the Parliament regards the alleged 
            handover of sovereignty from coalition occupying forces in Iraq as 
            completely fictitious; views the new Iraqi government as an unelected 
            puppet of the US regime, its sovereignty guaranteed by an army of 
            160,000 foreign fighters and 3,000 US diplomats; notes that the Iraqi 
            Prime Minister is a former CIA agent; notes that the new US embassy 
            in Baghdad will be the largest in the world and bigger than the Iraqi 
            government headquarters; notes that the US State Department has taken 
            $184m earmarked for drinking water projects and moved it to the budget 
            for the embassy; notes that the United States will continue to control 
            all aspects of Iraqi life through &quot;inspectors&quot; appointed 
            by the US; is outraged that 80,000 Western private mercenaries operating 
            on behalf of Western companies in Iraq have been given immunity from 
            prosecution for any crimes that they may commit including murder; 
            notes that the US will continue to detain some 5,000 Iraqis without 
            trial, and reaffirms its call for the immediate withdrawal of all 
            coalition troops from Iraq and the ending of the privatisation of 
            Iraq's infrastructure.</P>
