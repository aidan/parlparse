<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7273 Jeremy Purvis: Support for Business</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that there has been a stark increase in appeals to valuation boards over non-domestic rates following the 2010 revaluation, with approximately 30% of businesses appealing the new rates; believes that the increase in appeals reflects the fact that a lack of transitional relief has caused serious cash-flow problems for businesses and concerns that jobs will be lost; shares the view of the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce that small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) support is not a substitute for transitional relief for the hardest hit; notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s net income from non-domestic rates has increased by &pound;150 million following the revaluation, despite Scottish ministers&rsquo; claims that the revaluation is revenue neutral, and calls on the Scottish Government to work constructively with Scotland&rsquo;s business community to agree and deliver a transitional rates relief scheme and to identify ways in which to improve the revaluation process for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7272 Shona Robison: Carers and Young Carers Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication, in July 2010, of the carers and young carers strategy for Scotland for 2010 to 2015, Caring Together and Getting It Right For Young Carers; notes that this strategy has been produced jointly with COSLA and informed by a wide range of stakeholders; recognises the importance of providing effective and timely support to Scotland&rsquo;s estimated 657,000 unpaid carers in order to sustain them in their vital role in caring for relatives or friends affected by disability, illness or substance misuse, a role that benefits their families, local communities, Scottish society and the economy, and agrees that young carers should be relieved of inappropriate caring roles and supported to be children and young people first and foremost.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7270 Jamie Stone: Banning Bisphenol A</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that numerous studies and evaluations published in peer-reviewed medical journals have raised consistent and compelling concerns about the potential health risks of exposure to bisphenol A (BPA); understands that BPA has been found to leak from the plastic used in many baby feeding bottles, especially when the bottles are heated or are scratched through continual usage; notes that baby bottles containing the chemical can still be sold in the United Kingdom despite being withdrawn in Canada, Denmark and some American states; further notes Japan&rsquo;s canning and bottling industry&rsquo;s successful voluntary use-reduction of BPA and Canada&rsquo;s recent decision to classify BPA as a toxic substance; expresses support for the No More BPA campaign led by Breast Cancer UK, and urges the Scottish Government to introduce regulations to end the use of BPA, particularly in baby bottles.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7269 Liam McArthur: Renewable Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the commitment of the UK Government to allow the Fossil Fuel Levy surplus to be deployed for its purpose of supporting renewables in Scotland by delivering &pound;250 million of additional funding for Scotland through the green investment bank; recognises that this offer will provide substantial additional resources for Scotland, in excess of the accumulated &pound;180 million Fossil Fuel Levy surplus, and represents significant progress in releasing these funds to Scotland; supports the early establishment of the Green Investment Bank, and calls on the Scottish Government to signal its agreement in principle to this offer and agree to draw down the existing and future surpluses to fund spending on renewables.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7268 Kenny MacAskill: Criminal Procedure (Legal Assistance, Detention and Appeals) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Criminal Procedure (Legal Assistance, Detention and Appeals) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7259&diams;   Johann Lamont: Support for Children in Family and Friends Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that there is estimated to be a minimum of 13,400 children in kinship (family and friends) care in Glasgow and throughout Scotland; understands that three out of four of these families are living in poverty and that kinship care is frequently the best form of early intervention as well as a longer-term option for children requiring non-parental care, particularly for those who have experienced multiple traumas; notes that kinship care is estimated to save the Scottish Government and local authorities &pound;536 million per year in reduced care costs; considers with regret that the Scottish Government, the UK Government and Scottish local authorities have not yet been able to ensure provision of adequate financial, educational and other supports for children looked after by kinship carers; considers that there is currently insufficient joint working across all levels of government, and believes that kinship care provision is best developed with the involvement of kinship carers themselves as part of the decision-making process and that this would ensure that all policies are based on the needs of the child and that there is no discrimination of kinship carers based on their legal status or postcode.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7257 George Foulkes: Congratulations to the SPSA Staff at Howdenhall, Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the staff at the Edinburgh Forensic Laboratory at Howdenhall are to receive an award at the Scottish Policing Awards on 1 November 2010 in recognition of their response to a firebomb attack on the facility in February 2010; further notes that the staff were recipients of a Scottish Policing Award last year in relation to the conviction of Peter Tobin for the murder of Vicki Hamilton; believes that this is further evidence of the top quality service that the staff at Howdenhall provide; urges the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to give equal consideration to option 2 in the Scottish Police Service Authority&rsquo;s (SPSA) <em>Forensic Services Modernisation Options Paper</em>; asks the cabinet secretary to publish the option recommended by SPSA as soon as possible in order to allow what it considers proper scrutiny to be made before a decision is reached; considers that the SPSA consultation process was a sham, and is of the view that a withdrawal in key services at the forensics lab at Howdenhall would succeed where a firebomb failed.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-07212 Gil Paterson (West of Scotland) (Scottish National Party): Report on Draft Revised Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies in Scotland</strong>&mdash; That the Parliament agrees that the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&rsquo;s 6th Report, 2010 (Session 3): <em>Draft Revised Code of Practice for Ministerial Appointments to Public Bodies in Scotland</em> (SP Paper 491), together with the <em>Official Report</em> of the Parliament&rsquo;s debate on the report, should form the Parliament&rsquo;s response to the consultation by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland.</p>
