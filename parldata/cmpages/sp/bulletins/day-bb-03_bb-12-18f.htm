          <p><strong>*S2M-747</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of 
            the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&#8212;That 
            the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Primary Medical 
            Services (Scotland) Bill, debate on each part of the procedings shall 
            be brought to a conclusion by the time limits indicated (each time 
            limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any

          <p> Motion to pass the Bill &#8211; no later than 3 hours and 50 minutes</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-746#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Maternity 
            Services in Caithness</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes the 
            current review of maternity services in rural and remote communities 
            of Caithness and north Sutherland; believes that no &quot;one size 
            fits all&quot; model will deliver satisfactory solutions across the 
            country; considers that staff shortages and widely differing geographical 
            circumstances have to be accommodated, and further considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should instruct NHS Scotland to draw up consultant 
            contracts so that medical staff gain competencies in both large and 
            small hospitals and therefore fulfil the Executive&#8217;s pledge 
            that every child in Scotland be given the best possible start in life.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-745</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Keep 
            Smiling No One&#8217;s Going to Die</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            condemns the cynical tactics of the tobacco industry and the advertising 
            agencies that they employ in their attempts to recruit young people 
            to smoking; congratulates the Centre for Tobacco Control Research 
            at Strathclyde University for exposing the activities and attitudes 
            of the tobacco and advertising industries through the publication 
            of their documents on the internet at www.tobaccopapers.com; considers 
            that the use by these industries of language such as &quot;keep smiling 
            no one&#8217;s going to die&quot; to be totally inappropriate and 
            shows what the industries think of their customers, and notes that 
            once again the tobacco industry has been caught attempting to promote 
            a product that is responsible for the death of 13,000 Scots every 
            year, despite denials.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-744#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Fife 
            Health Board Cuts</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes with alarm 
            the proposals by NHS Fife to cut 37 nursing posts and other posts 
            in diatetics, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language 
            therapy to meet its financial overspend; believes that these cuts 
            will result in a poorer level of health care for the people of Fife; 
            considers that NHS Fife has lost the confidence of the people of Fife, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should conduct a full investigation 
            into NHS Fife.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-698.1</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Primary 
            Medical Services (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#8212;As an amendment to 
            motion (S2M-698) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;but, 
            in so doing, is concerned that rural practices unable to opt out of 
            out-of-hours services will have serious difficulty in recruiting new 
            doctors and therefore believes that it is imperative that the Scottish 
            Executive ensures that NHS boards honour the principles of the Patient 
            Services Guarantee in all areas, in particular in securing assistance 
            for single-handed GP practices in the provision of out-of-hours services 
            to remote and rural Scotland.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-698.2</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Primary

            motion (S2M-698) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;but, 
            in so doing, expresses concern that the delivery of the objectives 
            of the Bill requires scrutiny of all draft regulations by the Health 
            Committee before they are laid before the Parliament.&quot;</p>
