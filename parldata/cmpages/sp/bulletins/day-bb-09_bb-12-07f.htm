<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5362</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Toward a Royal Bank of Sustainability</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, for more than a year, the British taxpayer via UK Financial Investments Limited (UKFI) has been the largest shareholder in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS); welcomes the <em>Royal Bank of Sustainability</em> report, published by Friends of the Earth Scotland, Platform, World Development Movement, People and Planet and BankTrack, as an important contribution to the debate on the future of RBS and other bailed-out banks; believes that HM Treasury could play a key role in guiding RBS and the other bailed-out banks away from investments considered environmentally damaging and socially destructive, such as tar-sands, and toward more ethical investments urgently needed by Scotland and the United Kingdom; considers the business case for reorienting RBS&rsquo;s strategy to be strong and sound; believes that, by acting as responsible owners, HM Treasury and UKFI can begin turning the bank into a powerhouse for renewables and decarbonisation, which would be good for the economy as well as the climate; encourages the Chancellor of the Exchequer to require UKFI to incorporate the highest social and environmental standards into its investment mandate, ownership policies and practices, and calls on the UKFI to demand full disclosure by publicly supported banks on the impacts of their investments on communities, workers and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5361</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>11 December 2009, Day of Action on Student Hardship</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the National Union of Students in its efforts to highlight student hardship through a national day of action on the 11 December 2009; notes the events and action organised by student associations at universities and colleges across Scotland, including associations at Edinburgh Napier University, the University of Edinburgh, Inverness UHI College, James Watt College, Glasgow Metropolitan College, the Univeristy of Aberdeen and Aberdeen College, undertaking such activities as writing letters and petitions at the University of Stirling and a petition to Alex Salmond MSP from Banff and Buchan College; believes that this action signals that hardship remains a significant issue for students in Scotland; considers that the Scottish Government has broken its promise to dump the debt; believes that student hardship is a key factor in forcing students from lower-income backgrounds into commercial debt, to spend more than the guideline number of hours in part-time work recommended by the Cubie report or to drop out of their studies altogether; considers that opposition parties have been successful in directing the &pound;30 million made available by the Scottish Government for student support toward putting more pounds in student pockets; remains concerned that, despite these efforts, poorer students still receive less financial support than those in the rest of the UK, and urges the Scottish Government to address this inequality.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5360</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Berlusconi Ignores Political Reality in Belarus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the remarks of the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, during an official visit to Belarus on 30 November 2009 during which he stated that President Alyaksandr Lukashenka was loved by his own people, as outlined by his clear successive electoral victories; believes that such statements contradict reality in a country branded the last dictatorship in Europe; notes that the political situation in Belarus has been condemned by the European Union for its poor record on human rights and respect for minorities, lack of freedom of the press and for failing to organise transparent elections; further notes that Silvio Berlusconi is the first EU leader in over a decade to visit Belarus, and believes that the Italian leader has failed to promote EU values of democracy, liberty and freedom in a country suppressed by dictatorship.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5343</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Landowners Forcing Unreasonable Rent Demands on Tenant Farmers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the high cost of the legal process that has to be followed to challenge large rent increases imposed by landowners and land agents is forcing agricultural tenants to accept intolerable rent increases that they can ill afford and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate changing the law to provide an affordable and practical system that allows rent disputes to be handled without excessive legal costs.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5306</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Support the Cross Out Child Poverty in Scotland Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Cross Out Child Poverty in Scotland campaign organised by Glasgow the Caring City; notes the campaign event at Cathcart Conversations on 29 November 2009, which secured support across parties, across faiths and from across Glasgow&rsquo;s communities; welcomes the Cathcart Statement on Child Poverty, which reads &quot;We, the undersigned believe that Scotland&rsquo;s children deserve better. We believe that no society can be truly at ease with itself while significant numbers of children live in poverty. We believe that the elimination of child poverty must be a priority for us all - for politicians, community leaders and every member of society. We believe that poverty should be defined more widely than lack of money, that it encompasses a lack of education, of health, of welfare, of self-esteem and of love. We believe that poverty corrodes children&rsquo;s health, their happiness, their safety and their aspirations. We recognise that children whose lives are blighted by poverty are at higher risk of educational failure. We recognise that a life lived in poverty can lead to a life of drug abuse and exploitation. We believe that only through the elimination of child poverty can we expect the children of Scotland to live their lives to the full, and to be able to enjoy the opportunities that the rest of society take for granted. We, the undersigned, believe the time for change is here.&quot;; supports the aim of the campaign, to end child poverty; believes that this campaign highlights the critical importance at all levels of government of tackling child poverty, which denies too many children the right to a safe and happy childhood and the opportunity to achieve their potential; recognises that a key strength of this campaign is its understanding of the need to reach out beyond government to individuals and families and communities; believes that such unity of purpose can challenge poverty, and believes that signing this statement will show a commitment to the future of all Scotland&rsquo;s children and a determination to act on their behalf.</p>
