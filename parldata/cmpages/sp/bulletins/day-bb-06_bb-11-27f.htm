<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5229</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Stone of Destiny&rsquo;s Return to Scone Palace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 700th anniversary of the inauguration of King Robert the Bruce to the Scottish throne, which took place at Scone Palace in 1306; congratulates Scone Palace for holding a series of events throughout 2006 to commemorate the 700th anniversary; notes that 30 November 2006, St Andrew&rsquo;s Day, is the 10th anniversary of the Stone of Destiny being returned to Scotland, and believes that it is now time for the Stone of Destiny to be brought back to Scone Palace, its rightful home.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5228</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Fire and Rescue Services Youth Development Plan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish fire and rescue services&rsquo; youth development plan; recognises that the plan represents a blueprint for the improvement of communication and engagement between the Scottish fire and rescue services and Scotland&rsquo;s young people; welcomes the plan&rsquo;s recognition of the positive contribution made by young people in our society and the determination to work with communities, services, agencies and youth organisations to ensure the health, safety and welfare of young people; notes the plan&rsquo;s positive and practical approach to reducing antisocial behaviour directed against the fire services, and applauds the collaborative efforts of the Scottish Commissioner for Children and Young People, YouthLink Scotland, the Scottish Youth Parliament, the Prince&rsquo;s Trust, Young Scot and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in inputting to the plan.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5227</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>St Andrew&rsquo;s Day Anti-Racism Event</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its full support for the STUC&rsquo;s St Andrew&rsquo;s Day anti-racism event taking place on Saturday 25 November 2006 in Glasgow; encourages all MSPs and workers to support, publicise and attend the anti-racism march, which will set off from Blythswood Square at 11 am and culminate in a celebration of equality and diversity at the ABC in Sauchiehall Street, and believes that, in the present climate of violent attacks on members of minority ethnic communities and dawn raids on the families of those fleeing repression and torture, it is more important than ever to give a clear demonstration that Scotland stands together against racism.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5219</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with Solectron Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of Solectron Corporation, based in California, to announce the closure of the Solectron manufacturing plant in Dunfermline and the effective sacking of 440 workers; recognises that Solectron, Dunfermline, has grown in terms of sales and profits for seven consecutive quarters and is one of the most profitable sites in Europe, its quality of work is second to none and it has successfully made the transition to an unleaded manufacturing process more than four months before required by legislation; further condemns the fact that employees at Solectron were told in a webcast by bosses in California that their jobs were safe only to be told the next day that they would be affected by the announcement that Solectron is to shed 1,400 workers in Europe and North America but to employ 800 employees in Romania in order to pursue greater profits for the company; believes that the decision to sack 440 Scottish workers was taken primarily because under current legislation governing employment law in Scotland it is easier and cheaper to close a Scottish factory than one in France or Germany, not least because in the rest of Europe, where employment legislation is fairer, a worker can expect four weeks&rsquo; wages in redundancy payments for every year they have worked for a company compared with only one week&rsquo;s wages for every year in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to demand top-level talks with Solectron Corporation to convince it to reverse its unacceptable decision and to lobby New Labour in Westminster to bring redundancy payments and other legislation designed to protect worker&rsquo;s rights up to at least European-wide standards and to support the Trade Union Freedom Bill at Westminster, and supports the Solectron workers in whatever action they decide to take in defence of their jobs, factory and living conditions.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5206#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>School Inspections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policy, announced in 2002, that every Scottish school should have a full inspection by HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) within the lifetime journey of a pupil at a school, namely every seven years for a primary school and every six years for a secondary school, is the minimum standard which parents, pupils and teaching staff should expect for the maintenance of high quality national standards of teaching and learning and is, therefore, extremely disappointed and concerned that, following research by the Scottish Parent Teacher Council and the Times Educational Supplement Scotland, it has been established that there are 32 Scottish schools that have not had a full inspection by HMIE for at least 17 years and that, while nearly 300 schools are still waiting for their first full inspection report since 1995 or before, some schools have already had two, and believes that the Executive and HMIE should give urgent priority to inspections of those schools that have not yet had full inspection reports since as far back as the 1980s, namely, since 1983: Merkland Special School, East Dunbartonshire, Hillhead Primary School, Highland and Pinewood Special School, West Lothian, since 1984: Kelbourne Special School, Glasgow, since 1985: Mountfleurie Primary School, Fife, Stoneybridge Primary School, Western Isles and Hyndland Primary School, Glasgow, since 1986: Murrayfield Primary School, West Lothian and Tarbat Old Primary School, Highland, since 1987: St Teresa&rsquo;s Primary School, Dumfries, since 1988: Lismore Primary School, Edinburgh, Canisbay Primary School, Highland, Victoria Park Special School, South Lanarkshire, Crown Primary School, Highland, Coulhill Primary School, Highland, Balloch Primary School, Highland, Roybridge Primary School, Highland, Greenhill Primary School, North Lanarkshire, St Timothy&rsquo;s Primary School, Glasgow, Hilton Primary School, Highland, Carinish Primary School, Western Isles and St Margaret&rsquo;s Primary School, Dundee, since 1989: Sciennes Primary School, Edinburgh, Crombie Primary School, Fife, Battlefield Primary School, Glasgow, Cluny Primary School, Moray, Rosehall High School, North Lanarkshire, Barmulloch Primary School, Glasgow, Rosslyn Special School, Fife, Fordbank Primary School, Renfrewshire, Drumoyne Primary School, Glasgow and Carloway Primary School, Western Isles, that following completion of these inspections priority should then be given to the 270 schools that have not had inspections since between 1990 and 1995, by oldest inspection first, that no school that has been inspected since 1995 should, without exceptional circumstances agreed between the Executive and HMIE, be inspected again until this backlog has been cleared, an organised rota that reflects the Executive&rsquo;s policy is established and a full list of all Scottish schools and the date of their most recent full inspection, and any subsequent follow-up inspection, is posted on the HMIE website.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5195</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Scottish Football Association Hall of Fame</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the inclusion to the Scottish Football Association (SFA) Hall of Fame of players from other countries who have made an outstanding contribution to Scottish football but regrets the exclusion of some outstanding Scottish players such as Eric Caldow, who captained both Scotland and Rangers, and who, while captaining Scotland for his 40th cap at Wembley, tragically suffered a leg fracture which effectively ended his Scotland career; recognises that Eric Caldow also won 12 Scottish League caps, 5 Scottish League Championship Medals, 2 Scottish Cup Medals and 3 Scottish League Cup Medals; notes his exemplary record of fair play by being one of the few long-serving players who played in the tough atmosphere of Scottish football at that time but was never booked by a referee, and believes, therefore, that Eric Caldow should be included in the SFA Hall of Fame.</p>
