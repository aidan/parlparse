          <p><strong>*S2M-293</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Closing 
            the Opportunity Gap</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the 
            Executive's continuing commitment to breaking down the social, educational 
            and economic barriers that create inequality and the commitment to 
            working to end poverty by tackling deprivation and social needs, and 
            notes that to close the opportunity gap the Executive will deliver 
            community regeneration to build strong, safe and attractive communities; 
            measures to increase financial inclusion to reduce debt, measures 
            to improve standards of housing and to tackle homelessness and measures 
            to overcome barriers to training and employment to increase participation 
            in the labour market.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-292</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Investment 
            and Change in Cancer Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges 
            the progress made and the remaining challenges in implementing the 
            cancer strategy; recognises that the £60 million investment is leading 
            to many improvements to patient care; welcomes the development of 
            managed clinical networks and the redesign of cancer services under 
            way across the three regional cancer networks; supports an increased 
            focus on patient experience and patient involvement, and looks forward 
            to continuing change and innovation in order to reduce waiting times 
            and improve the quality of care.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-291#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Auxilliary 
            Fire Units in the Highlands</strong>&#151; That the Parliament notes 
            that auxiliary fire units play a vital role in many rural communities 
            in fighting fires and do so in conjunction with the retained fire 
            brigades; notes with concern that, following a report from Her Majesty's 
            Inspectorate of Fire Services (HMI), 32 auxiliary units face possible 
            closure; further notes that the new approach of integrated risk assessment 
            should permit the preservation of as many as possible of these auxiliary 
            units; considers that the Scottish Executive should explicitly endorse 
            the need for such units and acknowledge the essential role that they 
            play in protecting human life and property; believes that, if the 
            recommendations of the HMI report are not carefully considered and 
            auxiliary units are forced to close because of the proposed introduction 
            of compulsory access to breathing apparatus within a short timescale, 
            then human life and property may be placed at risk; believes that 
            all involved, including Highland Council, the Firemaster, HMI and 
            the Health and Safety Executive, should continue to discuss the implications 
            of the HMI report in the context of integrated risk assessment and 
            find an outcome that prevents the closure of so many of the auxiliary 
            units.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-290</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for the International Whaling Commission Moratorium on Commercial 
            Whaling</strong>&#151;That the Parliament pledges its support for 
            the moratorium on commercial whaling agreed by the International Whaling 
            Commission meeting in Berlin; is deeply concerned that Iceland has 
            resumed whaling and proposes to slaughter 500 sei, fin and minke whales 
            over the next two years; deplores Iceland's killing of minke whales 
            in 2003; notes the growing importance of whale watching and eco-tourism 
            to the future of both the Scottish and Icelandic tourist industry, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to highlight these concerns to 
            the Her Majesty's Government and add its opposition to commercial 
            whaling to that of the Her Majesty's Government and the wider international 
            community.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-289#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Nurse 
            Recruitment and Retention</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned 
            about the 52% rise in nurse vacancies since 1999 and the increase 
            in spend on agency nurses to £28 million per year; notes that nurse 
            recruitment and retention problems are not diminishing; understands 
            that nurses&#146; pay is an important part of the solution to the 
            recruitment and retention problem and pays tribute to the role played 
            by both the Royal College of Nursing and Unison campaigns in raising 
            awareness of this; recognises that the Agenda for Change has made 
            some progress on pay and conditions, but believes that there needs 
            to be a Scottish recruitment and retention premium, as allowed by 
            the Agenda for Change deal, in order to fully address the problem 
            of nurse recruitment and retention by attracting more nurses to come 
            and work in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-288</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of

          <p> <strong>*S2M-287.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>The 
            Scottish Economy</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-287) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;notes, however, the poor performance of the 
            economy with levels of growth lower than the rest of the United Kingdom, 
            falling levels of business start-ups, rising levels of business failure 
            and job losses in the private sector; recognises that the objective 
            of long-term, sustainable growth is currently being hindered by high 
            non-domestic rates, increased business water charges and a heavy burden 
            of corporate regulation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use 
            its existing powers to reduce the business rate poundage to levels 
            at least equal to those in England, to ease the burden of increased 
            water charges that are stifling business growth and to work proactively 
            to free businesses from undue regulation, thereby eliminating the 
            competitive disadvantage at which many Scottish businesses find themselves 
            relative to their English counterparts and allowing the Scottish economy 
            to grow to its full potential.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-287.2</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>The 
            Scottish Economy</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-287) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;recognises the enormous potential of the Scottish 
            people; accepts that Westminster control of Scotland&#146;s economic 
            policy has been disastrous for Scottish living standards, population 
            and national self-esteem; notes that, to reverse that trend, the Scottish 
            government must create the maximum competitive advantage for the Scottish 
            economy, and therefore calls on all parties to work together to win 
            for the Parliament the full powers that all independent countries 
            enjoy, in order to create a competitive advantage and the conditions 
            for a prosperous and just Scotland.&quot;</p>

            definition of &quot;meeting the needs of the present without compromising 
            the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&quot;; endorses 
            the Scottish Executive&#146;s establishment of a Sustainable Development 
            Forum and Sustainable Development Indicators as initial steps in the 
            direction of sustainability; recognises the need to create a spirit 
            of entrepreneurship, promote innovations and encourage sensible risk 
            taking; believes that this can be achieved by building on the strength 
            of our education system and research and development capability and 
            through development of specific initiatives such as a green jobs strategy; 
            welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s commitment to be responsive 
            to ways in which its current strategy can be enhanced and refined, 
            and affirms that long-term prosperity, first-class services and social
