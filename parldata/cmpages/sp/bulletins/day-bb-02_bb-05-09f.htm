          <p><strong>*S1M-3090</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Timber Industry 
            in the Scottish Borders</strong>-That the Parliament notes the terms 
            of S1M-2953 in the name of Alex Fergusson; further notes that the 
            largest timber growing area in the UK is the Kielder forest in the 
            Scottish Borders and that the most effective manner of removing dangerous 
            and destructive lorries hauling timber through the small towns and 
            villages of the Southern Borders is to reinstate not just the northern 
            but also the southern half of the Waverley line, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should undertake a fresh and full study into 
            the environmental impact of removing this freight from road to rail.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3089 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary

            in consideration of the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) 
            Bill and that the Justice 1 and 2 Committees and the Local Government 
            Committee be secondary committees. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3088#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Distribution 
            of Grants to Local Authorities</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            that the current system of distributing government grants to local 
            authorities needs to be radically overhauled in order to take account 
            more accurately of poverty and deprivation in each local authority 
            area; believes that the city of Glasgow in particular has been neglected 
            by the Scottish Executive in relation to local government financial 
            settlements because the current system fails to take greater account 
            of the real poverty and deprivation that exists in Glasgow; further 
            believes that, in a number of areas, the current distribution system 
            could be greatly improved in order to recognise the additional needs 
            and costs that arise from providing local government services in an 
            area suffering from high levels of poverty and deprivation; notes 
            that only 1.5% of the total grant available for education services 
            is set aside to provide additional services to &quot;deprived pupils&quot;, 
            despite the fact that there is a huge difference between the attainment 
            levels of children from deprived backgrounds compared to those from 
            more affluent backgrounds and that the levels of pupils staying on 
            to S5 and the levels of pupils who enter full-time education are heavily 
            influenced by the pupils' socio-economic background; believes that, 
            in order to address this imbalance, a greater proportion of available 
            grants needs to be made available to provide the additional support 
            required by pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds; further notes that 
            too little recognition is given to the fact that social work is one 
            of the main services greatly affected by levels of deprivation in 
            the Glasgow City Council area and that, while some attempt is made 
            to take account of deprivation, the current distribution system is 
            totally inadequate; recognises that, while it is widely accepted that 
            the vast majority of children who require social work support are 
            from deprived and disadvantaged backgrounds, only 14.5% of the funding 
            for community and residential care services for children is allocated 
            on the basis of indicators that take account of deprivation, the remainder 
            of the resources being allocated on the basis of the total number 
            of children under the age of 16 in each council area; further believes, 
            however, that given that the vast majority of children do not require 
            the support of social work services, it is absolutely perverse and 
            unacceptable that over 85% of the resources are distributed on the 
            basis of the size of this &quot;non-using population&quot; and that 
            it is therefore imperative that the distribution of resources in accordance 
            with the number of children living in poverty, rather than the child 
            population at large, is implemented; further recognises that the system 
            has failed in relation to social work services for disabled people 
            where the only indicator used in the current system to allocate resources 
            to local authorities is the size of the total population aged between 
            16 and 64 years of age, despite the fact that it is widely accepted 
            that poverty has an impact on the health of individuals and also on 
            their ability to fund service provision, i.e. that, while more affluent 
            persons may be able to afford care from a private provider, this option 
            is not available to persons from a deprived background who are wholly 
            reliant on the services provided by local authorities; further notes 
            that this treatment contrasts sharply with the distribution mechanism 
            introduced by Arbuthnott for distributing resources to health boards 
            for persons with a disability; notes that the above examples, only 
            covering three areas of service provision, clearly illustrate that 
            the grant distribution system is seriously deficient in respect of 
            taking account of the impact that deprivation has on the need for 
            and cost of providing local authority services, and recognises the 
            need for a radical overhaul of the distribution system in order to 
            reflect much more accurately social deprivation in each local authority 
            area.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3087</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: University of St Andrews 
            (Postgraduate Medical Degrees) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees

          <p><strong>*S1M-3086</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: American Society

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3081#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Transport Infrastructure 
            in the North East</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges that Aberdeen 
            is the only city of its size in the UK that does not have a by-pass; 
            notes that, according to the Aberdeen branch of the Institute of Directors, 
            the cost to the community of Aberdeen's inadequate transport infrastructure 
            is in the region of £20 million per year and that others estimate 
            the cost to be nearer £100 million; recognises that Aberdonians living 
            near the current trunk roads suffer from the effects of air and noise 
            pollution from heavy traffic and have their safety put at risk; further 
            notes that the Grandholm Bridge will close from 10 July 2002, which 
            will cause additional traffic chaos in the city, and further recognises 
            that Aberdeen and the north east are an economic powerhouse whose 
            future well-being is vital to Scotland and that there is an urgent 
            need to allocate the resources necessary to construct a western peripheral 
            route, with a third bridge over the River Don, as part of an integrated 
            transport system as proposed by NESTRANS.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3078.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Action to

            notes that a newly registered nurse's salary, at £16,005, is 9.7% 
            less than that of a newly qualified police constable and 11% less 
            than that of a qualified teacher; believes that addressing low pay 
            levels is central to addressing the problem of recruiting and retaining 
            nurses; further welcomes the work of the Scottish Integrated Workforce 
            Planning Group, and notes that the development of an adequately resourced 
            workforce planning strategy is essential if NHS employers are to offer 
            nurses the flexible working patterns and meaningful career paths that 
            they are entitled to expect from a 21st<sup> </sup>century employer 
            and that will enable them to continue working in the NHS.&quot; </p>
