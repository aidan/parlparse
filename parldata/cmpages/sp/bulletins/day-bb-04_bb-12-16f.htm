          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2166.1</strong> <STRONG>Colin Fox:</STRONG> <STRONG>Tourism - Ambitions for Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2166) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, insert at end &quot;; recognises that the tourism and hospitality sectors benefit from highly-motivated staff who feel valued in the jobs that they do and are fully rewarded and enjoy good conditions of employment, levels of pay and high job satisfaction, and believes that VisitScotland and the Executive should highlight those attractions and destinations that have attained good working relations and set the highest standard which other establishments should aim to emulate.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2166.2</strong> <STRONG>Brian Adam:</STRONG> <STRONG>Tourism - Ambitions for Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2166) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, leave out from &quot;approves&quot; to end and insert &quot;further recognises that tourism requires good access and good tourism experiences as well as marketing strategies; expresses concern over the uncertainties introduced by the Tourism Network Scotland (TNS) project, including potential compulsory redundancies, the financial shortfall and lack of a detailed business plan; commends the development of niche marketing strategies and the extension of the seasonal events to ensure that all Scotland benefits from a growing industry; seeks continued commitment to improving access through the Route Development Fund and a strategy for dealing with the consequences of changes to structural funds, and calls on the Scottish Executive, contingent upon production of the TNS business plan, to consider making available transitional funding to address any shortfall due to potential loss of membership income, local authority funding, redundancy costs and the ongoing structural deficit.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2166.3</strong> <STRONG>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</STRONG> <STRONG>Tourism - Ambitions for Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2166) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, leave out from &quot;approves&quot; to end and insert: &quot;urges the Scottish Executive to pursue a more ambitious target for growth in light of the aggressive policies being pursued by competitor countries; appreciates that long-term growth can only be achieved by ensuring that the marketing of Scotland in UK and overseas tourism markets is further strengthened and that the businesses that comprise the tourism and hospitality sectors are freed from the Executive&rsquo;s policies which are hampering business growth and enterprise throughout Scotland; regrets the uncertainty and consequent damage caused to the industry by the Executive&rsquo;s handling of the tourism network restructuring process; further regrets the potential loss of local knowledge and expertise that may result from the centralisation of the tourism network, and calls on the Executive to ensure that both the local tourist information centres and funding for the new tourism hubs are adequately protected once the new network commences in April.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2165.1</strong> <STRONG>Mike Rumbles:</STRONG> <STRONG>Proposed Defence Reviews from a Scottish Perspective</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2165) in the name of Murdo Fraser, insert at end &quot;as the best way to maintain the operational effectiveness of the Scottish infantry.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2165.2</strong> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan:</STRONG> <STRONG>Proposed Defence Reviews from a Scottish Perspective</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2165) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;considers that it is unacceptable for young men and women from Scotland to be committed to an illegal war based on lies and deceits; considers therefore that the votes of UK Parliaments on Iraq were tarnished; notes the sad reality that soldiers from Scotland have always suffered higher than proportional losses across the UK Army in all major conflicts, including the First and Second World Wars; believes in an independent Scotland and the unification of all Scottish soldiers into one Scottish Army unit committed to civil defence and humanitarian causes only; believes that the organisation of such a newly-unified Scottish Army should be based on the principles of accountability, earned respect and discipline and not on an out-moded hierarchical structure; believes that such a Scottish Army would be committed to civil defence and disallowed from involvement in illegal wars; further believes that the Scottish people should campaign for control of our own oil and gas resources and not allow blood to be spilled in pursuit of one country&rsquo;s desire to control another country&rsquo;s oil resources, and resolves to prevent the current British Army from using public labour exchanges and benefits offices, schools, colleges and training centres to mount recruitment campaigns.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2165.3</strong> <STRONG>Roseanna Cunningham:</STRONG> <STRONG>Proposed Defence Reviews from a Scottish Perspective</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2165) in the name of Murdo Fraser, insert at end &quot;and condemns the fact that these proposals have been developed while Black Watch soldiers and other members of the armed forces are involved in a dangerous conflict in Iraq.&quot;</p>

          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2158.1</strong> <STRONG>Colin Fox:</STRONG> <STRONG>Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffending</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2158) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;the way&quot; to end and insert &quot;, since 80% of male and female prisoners represent no danger to the public, non-custodial sentences should be given much greater consideration and support; calls on the Scottish Executive to provide more specially-trained community police officers accountable to the communities that they serve in order to increase public confidence in the justice system, and reaffirms that, in cases where serious crimes have been committed, remission should be earned and fully recognised by both the wider community and the prison population itself.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2158.2</strong> <STRONG>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</STRONG> <STRONG>Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffending</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2158) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;accepts&quot; to end and insert &quot;further notes that the causes of crime are manifold, involving social and economic dislocation and family and community fragmentation with drink, drugs and deprivation remaining at the root of much crime and antisocial behaviour; notes with concern that Scotland is heading towards having the highest per capita prison population in western Europe; calls, therefore, for a visible police presence in our communities and for prison to be reserved for serious and dangerous offenders; calls for action to be taken to ensure that community-based disposals are available for minor offences to ensure rehabilitation and best use of public funds; calls, therefore, on the Executive to ensure that it is not only tough on crime but tough on the causes of crime, and recognises that the solutions are multifaceted and require individuals to take responsibility for their own actions and for society to take responsibility for all its communities.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2158.3</strong> <STRONG>Hugh Henry:</STRONG> <STRONG>Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffending</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2158) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;unacceptable&quot; to end and insert &quot;Criminal Justice Plan&rsquo;s acknowledgement that the rate of reoffending occurring in Scotland today is unacceptable; agrees that prison should be used where prison is the appropriate punishment but notes that prison is also intended to rehabilitate the offender, deter the prospective offender and protect the public; agrees that prison must sit within a range of different sentencing options to address reoffending, and therefore notes the increase in police numbers compared to the numbers delivered by the Conservatives, the establishment of the Sentencing Commission to consider a number of issues including early release, and that the recently published Criminal Justice Plan includes measures to tackle Scotland&rsquo;s high reoffending rates, reduce crime and the fear of crime and strengthen confidence in the country&rsquo;s criminal justice services.&quot;</p>
