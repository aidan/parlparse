            College, Auchincruive</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the 
            important contribution that the Scottish Agricultural College, Auchincruive, 
            formerly the West of Scotland Agricultural College, has made and continues 
            to make to the rural economy of Scotland; deplores the plans by the 
            Scottish Agricultural College to downgrade Auchincruive to a mere 
            delivery vehicle for education courses in association with Paisley 
            University; views with concern the prospective closure of Auchincruive 
            as a research and teaching facility if and when it amalgamates with 
            the University's Ayr campus, and considers that such a closure would 
            be detrimental to the economic development of Ayrshire and the south 
            of Scotland.</p>

            efficient, bringing considerable benefits to all customers; recognises 
            the Executive's continuing commitment to a public water industry; 
            recognises that the best way to fund the Scottish water industry is 
            through charges on domestic and non-domestic customers utilising the 
            services provided; recognises that the current system for charging 
            domestic customers already provides a degree of protection for lower 
            income households and the most vulnerable through the link to council 
            tax banding, and finally recognises that the reduction scheme provides 
            help to those low income households facing the biggest charge increases.&quot;

            of local government finance which, under Labour's stewardship, has 
            resulted in an increase of £103 to the average householder's yearly 
            tax bill while local services have deteriorated, and calls for a full 
            review of local government finance which includes the replacement 
            of unfair property based taxation with a system of local income tax, 
            which takes account of ability to pay.&quot;</p>

            including the stability for three year council tax figures and welcomes 
            the Executive's commitment to pursue further reforms; further welcomes 
            the fact that councils are now collecting a higher proportion of council 
            tax than ever before and the continuing work by the Executive and 
            local authorities to better target and further improve collection 
            arrangements, and notes that the Local Government Committee of the

            insert &quot;that £6 billion has been made available to Scotland since 
            1975 through European Union (EU) structural funding; further recognises 
            that, because of EU enlargement, the level of support offered to Scotland 
            in future years is likely to diminish, and urges the Scottish Executive 
            to ensure that the full benefits of EU structural funds still available 
            are used for sustainable, strategic and infrastructure improvements 
            and to involve itself fully in the ongoing debate about the future
