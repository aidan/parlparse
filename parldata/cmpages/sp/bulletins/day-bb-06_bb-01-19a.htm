<p align="center"><strong>Section A &ndash; Today&rsquo;s Business</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary  Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed  by</em> Executive  Debate: Economic Benefits of the Air Routes Development Fund&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-3837 Tavish Scott: Air Route Development Fund&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament endorses the success  of the Air Route Development Fund (ARDF) in bringing direct Scottish air links  to Europe, North America and within the UK; notes the economic advantages that  have flowed to the Scottish economy and the reduced need for short haul flights  through hub airports; supports the development of a European regime that  tackles the environmental impact of aviation emissions; further supports work  to improve rail journey times between Scotland and London in order to reduce  the reliance on domestic short haul flights, and looks to the further use of  the ARDF in developing Scotland&rsquo;s international connections. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-3837.2 Fergus Ewing: Air Route Development Fund&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3837)  in the name of Tavish Scott, insert at end &ldquo;further acknowledges the importance  of aviation in the prime aim of growing the Scottish economy; urges the  Executive to seek to remove barriers to further success in aviation policy;  calls on the Executive to audit and review the ARDF and its efficacy thus far,  with a view to refining and widening its terms, and to consider, for example,  its extension to air freight traffic and to less frequent and seasonal  services, and urges the Executive to work with Scotland&rsquo;s airports and carriers  to deliver a competitive economic environment, which should include the provision  of appropriate and sufficient infrastructure for our airports.&rdquo; </p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3837.1 Murdo Fraser: Air Route Development Fund&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3837)  in the name of Tavish Scott, insert at end &ldquo;notes, however, that the ARDF  represents a comparatively modest contribution to the massive expansion of air  services over recent decades, which is chiefly due to the substantial  deregulation of the industry achieved by the liberalising policies of the last  Conservative administration, such as the privatisation of the British Airports  Authority (BAA), the privatisation of British Airways (BA), the Airports Act  1986, the Civil Aviation Act 1980 and the pursuit of a European single market  in aviation.&rdquo; </p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3837.3 Mr Mark Ruskell: Air Route Development Fund&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3837)  in the name of Tavish Scott, leave out from &ldquo;endorses&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;questions  the success of the Air Route Development Fund (ARDF) in bringing sustainable  development benefits to Scotland; further questions whether economic advantages  have flowed to the Scottish economy from the ARDF; supports the development of  an international regime that reduces overall aviation emissions; notes that  promoting expansion of aviation undermines existing emissions targets and that projected  growth in aviation would necessitate cessation of economic activity in other  sectors in order to achieve targets; notes that the net cost of aviation to the  Scottish economy was &pound;1.4 billion in 2004 and that the United Kingdom accounts  for 87% of tourist visits to Scotland; supports work to improve rail journey  times between Scotland and London in order to reduce the reliance on domestic  short-haul flights but notes the lack of progress in this respect, and condemns  the further use of public funds for the ARDF.&rdquo; </p>
