    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-209#</b> <strong>Alex Fergusson: South West Transport Links</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament welcomes Stena Sealink&#146;s recent decision to create 20 new jobs by
    substantially increasing its investment in the Loch Ryan to Northern Ireland ferry route,
    and calls upon the Executive to match that commitment by announcing significant road
    improvement schemes for the A75 and A77 trunk routes to Stranraer.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-208#</b> <strong>Michael Russell: Unemployment in North Ayrshire</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that the September unemployment figures for North Ayrshire confirm
    its position as the second worst unemployment blackspot in Scotland and seeks the urgent
    attention of the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Parliament, and North Ayrshire Council
    to address the human and economic crisis that exists in this part of Scotland.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Mr Murray Tosh</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-207</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Pensions Increase</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament expresses its disgust at the pension increase of seventy-five pence a week to
    be paid out by Her Majesty&#146;s Government; believes that this increase is a good reason
    for the Scottish Parliament to have powers over social security, and calls upon Her
    Majesty&#146;s Government to give a substantial increase to pensioners and to restore the
    link to average earnings.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Alex Neil</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-206</b> <strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: Respect Campaign</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament welcomes the Respect campaign as piloted by Zero Tolerance and wishes to place
    primary prevention at the heart of its strategy to target male violence.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-205#</b> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Helicopter Crash on Mull of Kintyre</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with concern the distress of the relatives of the pilots killed in
    the crash of Chinook ZD576 on the Mull of Kintyre on 2 June 1994, the cause of which was
    attributed by the Ministry of Defence to pilot error; notes further that information
    regarding the FADEC system used in the flight was not available to the fatal accident
    inquiry held in Paisley, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to consider further
    inquiries into the events relating to the crash and its investigation.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Phil Gallie</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-204#</b> <strong>Ms Irene Oldfather: Removal of Patients from GP Lists</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the Scottish Executive&#146;s commitment to a patient centred
    health service, but notes with concern the threat to public confidence posed by the
    perceived unfairness of the removal of a patient from a General Practitioner&#146;s list
    and, while defending the right of doctors to terminate a relationship which is not
    working, calls upon the Executive to draw up plans to require General Practitioners to
    provide reasons when removing patients from their lists.</p>
