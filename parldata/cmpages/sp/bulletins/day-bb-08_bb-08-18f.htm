<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2401</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Highlands and Islands-Friendly Quality Mark</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports a proposal from Sanday Community Council in Orkney for the Scottish Government to award a Highlands and Islands-friendly quality mark for those mail order companies and couriers that do not charge extra for delivering goods to postcodes in the Highlands and Islands; considers that the extra charges that some firms impose for customers in remote and rural areas are unfair, unjust and effectively treat those residents as second-class citizens; welcomes the idea of promoting firms that practise a &quot;one price for all&quot; policy, and calls on those firms that impose extra costs for deliveries to rural areas and islands to follow best practice examples such as Amazon and the Royal Mail.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2400</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Farming Concerns</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the effects of&nbsp;the&nbsp;rising input costs of feed, fuel and fertiliser on Scottish farmers; recognises that the return many farmers make does not cover the costs of production; further recognises the role that farmers play in feeding Scotland&rsquo;s population, maintaining Scotland&rsquo;s famous countryside and underpinning rural communities and that they contributed &pound;2.1&nbsp;billion directly to the Scottish economy&nbsp;in 2007, and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s undertaking to meet supermarket bosses to discuss how government and retailers can work together to ensure a sustainable and profitable future for Scottish farming.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2399</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Sail Clyde Strategy Launch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Enterprise Sail Clyde Steering Group on the launch of its new strategy, which is to take place on Friday 29 August 2008 in Largs; notes that Sail Clyde is a business development strategy to stimulate expansion of the marine leisure industry and improve facilities for recreational boating in the Firth of Clyde; further notes that Sail Clyde aims to double the number of yachts and motor cruisers on the Clyde in the next decade and to increase significantly marine tourism and marine business of all kinds, and acknowledges that implementing this strategy will help provide more money and jobs in the local economy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2398</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>National Allotments Week 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes National Allotments Week 2008, being held from 11 to 17 August 2008; believes that allotments can make a big contribution to healthier living and knowledge of the environment and the seasonality of food; notes the potential for positive links with local schools, and urges all local authorities to identify more high quality sites to satisfy the growing demand for allotments in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2397</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Helping Cambuslang Allotments Forum Grow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the Cambuslang Allotment Forum and the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society; welcomes National Allotment Week as an opportunity to highlight the immense physical and mental health benefits tending allotments can bring; believes that by growing fresh produce people can play an important part in improving the nutrition of Scots and help tackle serious issues such as obesity; supports, in particular, the efforts of the Cambuslang Allotment Forum in its attempt to identify suitable land to deal with the list of local residents currently waiting to secure allotments; calls on South Lanarkshire Council to acknowledge that allotments make a significant contribution to 14 of the 45 National Outcomes as detailed in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s historic concordat with local authorities and therefore strongly encourages South Lanarkshire Council to work constructively with the forum to ensure suitable sites are located, and calls on all budding green-fingered allotment enthusiasts in Rutherglen and Cambuslang to get in contact with the Cambuslang Allotment Forum to find out how they can help the campaign and hopefully have their own allotments in the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2396</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Students Hit by Credit Crunch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the rising cost of rent for students studying in Scotland and that the &pound;71.06 spent on average on rent in Edinburgh has risen by 20% in the last four years alone; recognises that the scrapping of the graduate endowment does nothing to directly help those students most in need of financial help while at university; supports those Labour MSPs calling for student support funding to be boosted to bring it into line with England and Wales; believes that the SNP grandstands about its achievements in higher education while backroom cuts and efficiency savings leave Scotland&rsquo;s poorest students worse off than their English and Welsh counterparts, and recognises that rent is the single biggest expense for students and that the Scottish Government must do more to alleviate the strains on the student housing market by ruling out HMO quotas, incentivising universities to build more publicly-owned student housing and helping first-time buyers so that there is less competitive pressure on the housing market.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2389</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Baby Ban on Buses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern reports that Lothian Buses has introduced what appears to be a ban on prams on its buses; considers the bus company&rsquo;s apparent decision to ensure that the dedicated space provided on its newer vehicles should not be used for prams but should be left vacant for wheelchair users, even where no one requires it, to be discriminatory towards young families and infants; recognises the vital importance of making public transport more accessible to disabled users, but feels strongly that it would be inappropriate for a service provider to exclude other service users when the space is available; suggests that it is not acceptable that a large number of parents, the vast majority of whom are women, may be deprived of the ability to use their local bus service because Lothian Buses does not seem to be taking a common-sense approach to the use of space on its buses; notes that any exclusion of prams from Lothian Buses&rsquo; services is likely to impact worst on poor families and single parents with no access to other forms of transport, resulting in the further exclusion of an already severely marginalised group, and, therefore, urges the Scottish Government to ensure that Lothian Buses, or any other bus service provider, is required to revisit any decision to implement unnecessary and potentially discriminatory access restrictions on its services.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2388</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Councillor Dornan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Councillor James Dornan on his election to the post of leader of the SNP group on Glasgow City Council; notes that the vacancy was created by the stunning success of the SNP in having former group leader, John Mason, elected as Scotland&rsquo;s newest Member of the UK Parliament; wishes Councillor Dornan and his team well; is confident that he can lead the group to victory in Glasgow at the next council elections; calls on all council groups in Glasgow City Council to work with the Scottish Government to deliver on the joint concordat commitments; hopes that the ruling Labour group in Glasgow City Council will make a genuine attempt to implement the historic concordat with the Scottish Government, and is confident that the SNP opposition group will keep the pressure on Labour in Glasgow to deliver on a range of commitments including reducing class sizes and kinship care payments, two areas where Glasgow Labour has been too slow and SNP MSPs and councillors have been pushing for action.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2387</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that herbal remedies and food supplements are widely used by many people in the United Kingdom; further notes that since the adoption of the traditional herbal medicinal products directive (THMPD) by the European Parliament only 14 products have so far been approved for use; expresses grave concern that the THMPD will lead to thousands of safe and popular herbal remedies and food supplements becoming unavailable, and calls on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to urge the European Union to review this legislation to remove the threat it poses to the herbal remedies sector.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2385</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Fighting in South Ossetia and Georgia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament strongly condemns the fighting in South Ossetia and Georgia which has led to over 2,000 reported civilian deaths; calls on both sides involved in the conflict to take up an immediate ceasefire to allow negotiations to begin; views the actions of the Russian Federation as unacceptable and wholly disproportionate; notes with extreme concern the escalation in violence which has spread beyond South Ossetia, and calls upon the United Nations, European Union and other influential partners to intervene in the region to prevent further unnecessary deaths.</p>
