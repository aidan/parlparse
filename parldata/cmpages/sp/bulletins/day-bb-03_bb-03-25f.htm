            including her long battle for 500,000 people in Scotland with chronic 
            pain, her pioneering win in Europe of a landmark pollution case to 
            protect Glasgow, her example in turning out to help constituents during 
            every crisis, from East End flooding to protecting Govanhill pool 
            protesters against a police horse charge, her exposure of injustice 
            to the villagers of Blairingone in a scholarly parliamentary report 
            and her tenacity in always putting the public first, together with 
            her warm-hearted helpfulness to many MSPs.</p>
