          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2132</strong> <STRONG>Carolyn Leckie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Iraq</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern that Iraqi civilians have reported the use of napalm and/or phosphorous cluster bombs by US forces in their attack on the city of Fallujah, that the use of such weapons is banned by United Nations international treaty to which the United Kingdom is a signatory and therefore utterly condemns any failure of the United States to abide by international treaties and the use of such weapons of mass destruction; notes the International Committee of the Red Cross&rsquo;s recent call to both parties to the conflict in Iraq which stated that it is prohibited to torture participants or to subject them to any form of inhuman, humiliating or degrading treatment and that both sides must do everything possible to help civilians caught up in the fighting obtain the basics of survival such as food, water and health care, notes that there were reliable reports of US forces cutting off water supplies to Fallujah prior to the assault and therefore, along with the Red Cross, believes that &quot;for the parties to this conflict, complying with international humanitarian law is an obligation, not an option&quot;; believes that the war in Iraq was based on deceit and lies and that far from ending terrorism &quot;American actions have instead elevated the authority of the jihadi insurgents and tended to ratify their legitimacy among Muslims&quot; and that most Muslims think that &quot;the occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq has not led to democracy there, but only more chaos and suffering&quot;, as stated by the Defence Science Board, notes that the war has resulted in a humanitarian disaster with as many as 100,000 Iraqis having lost their lives and malnutrition amongst Iraqi children having almost doubled and that British and US troops are seen by most Iraqis as occupiers rather than liberators and therefore believes that it is in the best interests of all for all troops to be brought home for Christmas.</p>

          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2131</strong> <STRONG>Bristow Muldoon:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fire Safety</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the unacceptably high level of fire deaths and injuries within Scotland, 84 fatal casualties and 1,718 non-fatal casualties, as reported in <EM>HM Chief Inspector of Fire Services for Scotland &ndash; Annual Report 2002-03</EM>; believes that the most effective way to reduce this unacceptable level of human suffering is to ensure that the fire and rescue services develop more effective community safety initiatives; recognises the excellent work carried out within West Lothian where Lothian and Borders Fire Brigade carried out a home safety fire risk assessment in every home within the area; further recognises the quality of the success of this initiative, where over 94% of respondents were very satisfied with the home safety check, 92% stated that they now felt safer from fire in their home, 95% of the firefighters involved in the project agreed that the community welcomed their efforts to reduce the number of fire fatalities occurring within the home and 85% agreed that it should be the fire brigade&rsquo;s responsibility to give home fire safety advice to the community; confirms that fire safety is high on the agenda of the Parliament, and encourages the Scottish Executive in its determination to make community fire safety a statutory duty for fire authorities.</p>

          <p> <STRONG><a name="2129"></a>*S2M-2129</strong> <STRONG>Ross Finnie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fisheries</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scottish Executive in its efforts to negotiate the best possible outcome from the EU Fisheries Council in December 2004, an outcome that delivers sustainable fisheries, sustainable fishing businesses and sustainable fishing communities based on Total Allowable Catches and management controls that are both fair and effective.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2128#</strong> <STRONG>Roseanna Cunningham:</STRONG> <STRONG>Westminster Energy Bill and EC State Aid Rules</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the European Commission to launch an investigation into whether the UK Government will contravene EU competition rules in establishing a nuclear decommissioning authority which could provide subsidies of &pound;48 billion to the nuclear industry; notes that legal opinion obtained by Greenpeace makes a case that the Westminster Energy Bill involves the establishment of a state aid scheme which enables the proposed nuclear decommissioning authority to carry out decommissioning for private, as well as state, operators from public funds and that it provides the legislative infrastructure to enable further aid to be granted to British Energy over and above that proposed by the restructuring package; recognises that the nuclear industry has, for decades, depended on direct state support while leaving a legacy of nuclear waste and vast stocks of weapons-usable plutonium, and believes that the new commission now has the opportunity to demonstrate its independence from the nuclear lobby by reaching a decision which could bring an end to the massive state subsidies enjoyed by the nuclear industry.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2127</strong> <STRONG>Margaret Smith:</STRONG> <STRONG>Public Liability Insurance and Community Organisations</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the massive increase in the cost of public liability insurance over the last three years and the negative impact that this is having on traditional community events throughout the country; notes that, in one case in Edinburgh, an insurance quote of &pound;14,500 was given to the Corstorphine Fair from the same company that quoted just &pound;1,000 two years ago; recognises that the cost of insurance is now jeopardising the future of a number of fundraising and community events, including Christmas events, and rejects the main excuse put forward by insurance companies that the increased premiums are required because of the rise of international terrorism, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to look into this issue as a matter of urgency to ensure that these events, which are so important to local communities, are able to continue.</p>

          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2126</strong> <STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</STRONG> <STRONG>Business Motion</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Justice 2 Committee reports to the Justice 1 Committee by 7 January 2005 on the draft Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2004 (Incidental, Supplemental and Consequential Provisions) Order 2005.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2125</strong> <STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</STRONG> <STRONG>Designation of Lead Committee</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Justice 1 Committee be designated as lead committee in consideration of the draft Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2004 (Incidental, Supplemental and Consequential Provisions) Order 2005.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2124</strong> <STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</STRONG> <STRONG>Approval of SSI</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2004 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2123</strong> <STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</STRONG> <STRONG>Approval of SSI</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (No. 2) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/500) be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-2122</strong> <STRONG>Mr Adam Ingram:</STRONG> <STRONG>Prescribing Anti-Depressants</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the warnings from the medical profession, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence regarding the rise in the prescribing of anti-depressants and, in particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and their safety; notes that, whilst medication has a role to play for some patients, other non-pharmacological therapies must be made widely available to offer both patients and GPs alternative methods of treatment, and calls on the Scottish Executive to commit itself to increase both the standard and availability of non-pharmacological treatment.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2121</strong> <STRONG>Colin Fox:</STRONG> <STRONG>Scotland&rsquo;s Private Prisons</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the remarks of Tony Blair MP in April 1994, in condemning government proposals to privatise Scottish prisons, that &quot;these proposals are wrong in principle and is committed to opposing them at every opportunity. &hellip; those who are sentenced to imprisonment by the state should be deprived of their liberty by those who are accountable to the state and not to private shareholders. &hellip; A Labour Government would bring the prisons back within the proper public prison system at the earliest opportunity&quot;; further notes plans by the Scottish Executive for two further prisons that may be privately owned in addition to the one at Kilmarnock owned by Premier Prisons Ltd; believes that imprisonment remains the responsibility of the state and that profiteering from the incarceration of others is immoral, and therefore believes that all Scotland&rsquo;s privately-owned prisons ought to be &quot;back within the proper public prison system at the earliest opportunity&quot;.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2120#</strong> <STRONG>Christine Grahame:</STRONG> <STRONG>Scottish Borders Children&rsquo;s Panel</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the terms of the letter of 3 December 2004 from the Chairman of Scottish Borders Children&rsquo;s Panel Advisory Committee, as instructed by the Committee, to the Minister for Education and Young People which states, <EM>inter alia</EM>, serious concern that increasing demands on panel members in terms of number and complexity of cases and additional training are having a detrimental effect on the welfare of those members, that this has led to an increasing turnover in members, causing hearings to be cancelled, that some panel members are experiencing training and hearing commitments &quot;overload&quot; and that &quot;what is being asked is beyond the voluntary nature of the appointment&quot;; notes that there are &quot;grave concerns that the current review may not happen soon enough&quot;; further notes that, because of resignations, the panel is operating with 30% fewer members and that approaches have now had to be made to East Lothian and Midlothian panel areas to establish whether those panel members could be made available; notes that this undermines the ethos of the panel system, that cases should be heard before representatives of the local community; further notes that phase 2 of the review, due to commence in November, has now been postponed, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency in the above circumstances and recognising the sterling work of panel members and the distinctive and crucial function of the children&rsquo;s hearing system, intervene to assist panel members in the Scottish Borders and further should accelerate the review.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2117.1</strong> <STRONG>Fergus Ewing:</STRONG> <STRONG>Executive-Supported Lifeline Ferry Services in the Clyde and Hebrides</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2117) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that lifeline ferry services must be provided and an element of public subsidy will be required for that aim; further believes that the proposed national concessionary travel scheme should be extended to ferry travel; calls on the Scottish Executive to provide documented evidence showing that EU law requires that the tendering process which the Executive proposes must be undertaken; is concerned about the potential impact that this process may have upon the employment conditions of staff working on ferries, and notes that many passengers have voiced serious concerns about both the efficiency and effectiveness of the current ferry services provided by Caledonian MacBrayne which require a thorough and independent investigation.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2117.2</strong> <STRONG>David Mundell:</STRONG> <STRONG>Executive-Supported Lifeline Ferry Services in the Clyde and Hebrides</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2117) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the continued uncertainty inflicted upon Caledonian MacBrayne, its employees and customers as a result of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s handling of the tendering process; regrets that Clyde and Hebridean ferry services are going out to tender purely to satisfy the wishes of the European Commission, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put the interests of our island communities before those of the European Commission.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-2117.3</strong> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan:</STRONG> <STRONG>Executive-Supported Lifeline Ferry Services in the Clyde and Hebrides</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2117) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that such commitment is not in contravention of EU competition rules and should therefore be continued and extended without the danger and increased costs that tendering such services would bring, and considers that the Executive should be prepared to mount a legal challenge should such lifeline service support be threatened by EU competition rules.&quot;</p>
