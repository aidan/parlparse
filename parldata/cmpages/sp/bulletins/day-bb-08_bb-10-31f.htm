<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2803</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>National Stress Awareness Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament marks National Stress Awareness Day on 5 November 2008; notes that an estimated one in four workers will experience depression, anxiety or stress-related problems during their lifetime; further notes that excessive stress can often lead to long-term mental health problems; recognises that sickness absence due to mental health problems costs Scotland&rsquo;s employers around &pound;360 million each year; welcomes the launch of Work Positive, a free online resource to help employers tackle stress in Scotland&rsquo;s workplaces, and encourages businesses to take advantage of the range of free services offered by the Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives to help them create healthier and more productive workplaces.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2802</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Helensburgh Heroes - Changing the World for the Better</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Helensburgh Heroes; notes that this non-profit-making organisation will be run and managed by people who share a passion for the Helensburgh area and actively want to contribute to its regeneration; considers that some of the finest scientific, creative and business people that have ever lived have very strong links with the Helensburgh and Lomond area, including the inventors of television and the board game Cranium, Hollywood stars and directors, steam ship pioneers, mathematicians, novelists, the leading lights of the Glasgow Arts and Crafts Movement, gold winning Olympians, war heroes, opera singers, recording stars and even a UK Prime Minister; believes that Helensburgh Heroes will be the catalyst that blends the area&rsquo;s rich cultural heritage with a range of arts, leisure and tourist facilities that will educate, entertain and inspire future generations to become tomorrow&rsquo;s heroes, and congratulates all those involved with the launch on Saturday 1 November 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2801</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Time to Enshrine Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Law</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its disappointment and frustration at the failure of the UK Government to begin ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, designed as the first treaty in history to give the millions of disabled people across the globe comprehensive human rights, despite having signed the convention in March 2007; acknowledges the petition available at http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/noreservations/ calling on the Prime Minister to ratify the convention in full by December 2008, and urges the UK Government to do so.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2800</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Fireworks Don&rsquo;t Work for Animals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concerns of the SSPCA, Scotland&rsquo;s animal welfare charity, regarding the danger to domestic and wild animals as a result of the widespread use of fireworks well in advance of 5 November and in the days and sometimes weeks after; further notes that while powers in relation to the sale of fireworks remain reserved to Westminster, powers in relation to their use are devolved, and therefore considers that the Scottish Government should embark on a national consultation with a view to bringing forward legislation to regulate further the use and discharge of fireworks, whether for public or personal displays, in order that the welfare of animals is more greatly safeguarded.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2799</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Welcome New Rights for Disabled and Elderly People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006, which came into force throughout Europe in the summer of 2008 and is designed specifically to give disabled and elderly people access to air transport comparable to that enjoyed by all other passengers flying to or from, or passing in transit through, airports in the European Union, with no discrimination and at no additional cost; believes that, as a result, no traveller with reduced mobility should experience any form of discrimination, and urges anyone who does to inform the national enforcement body, which in Scotland is the Equality and Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2798</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Post Office Closures in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply disappointed at Post Office Ltd&rsquo;s decision to close 11 Post Office branches in Edinburgh as part of the UK Government&rsquo;s Post Office Network Change Programme, which is set to close 2,500 post offices across the United Kingdom; is concerned at the damage that the closures will do to communities in Edinburgh that rely on their local post office; recognises the problems that the closures will cause for elderly residents and those with mobility problems, who could now face a daunting journey to their nearest post office; regrets that once Post Office Ltd has decided on closing a post office branch only Postwatch, now part of Consumer Focus, can review the decision before it is announced, following which there is no appeal process, and notes the questions that this raises as to the credibility of the branch closure consultation process.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2797</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure of a kind referred to in Rule 9.12.3(b)(ii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2796</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill (SP Bill 12)</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2795</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>Support the PCS Pay Strike on 10 November 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its solidarity with the members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) in Scottish and UK government departments in their national industrial action over a 2% pay cap; notes that, amid spiralling food, fuel and transport prices, financial insecurity and Retail Price Index and Consumer Price Index inflation rates at 5% and 5.2% respectively, low-paid public sector workers should not be condemned to below-inflation effective pay cuts; commends Scotland&rsquo;s civil servants for the sterling work that they do in providing vital services to the public, and urges Scottish and UK ministers to review pay policies that are penalising their own workforces at this time of unprecedented significant developments in the economic climate.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2794#</strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Seabirds</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern recent data from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) Scotland highlighting another terrible season for Scotland&rsquo;s breeding seabirds, notably Arctic skuas, Arctic terns and kittiwakes; is alarmed that many of our internationally important species have now suffered successive poor breeding seasons over a period of years, with evidence suggesting that the Scottish populations of these species are experiencing substantial declines; notes that Scotland is an internationally important breeding ground for seabirds, with spectacular coastal seabird colonies in areas such as north-east Scotland and the Northern Isles containing 45% of the European Union&rsquo;s breeding populations; further notes that seabird populations are a key health indicator for the marine environment as a whole, and considers that the forthcoming Scottish marine bill offers an opportunity to examine what can be done to address the catastrophic decline of our seabird populations.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2793</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Safety Anomaly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that Health and Safety Executive statistics published on 29 October 2008 show that in 2007-08 there were 32 fatal injuries and 2,721 major injuries to workers in Scotland, compared to 229 and 27,976 in the United Kingdom as a whole, and that the rate of fatal and major injuries in Scottish was 115.1 per hundred thousand, compared to 105.8 for the UK as a whole; further notes that only 52% of related prosecutions were successful in Scotland, compared to 89% in the rest of the UK; believes that, despite improvements across the UK, there is a persistent anomaly in the figures for Scotland that needs to be addressed, and further believes that serious consideration should be given to steps that can be taken within devolved powers to address this anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2792</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Fundraising for Uganda</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St George&rsquo;s Church, together with the wider community of Tillydrone in Aberdeen, for their fundraising efforts and active support for the community in Bezallel in Uganda during the last five years; applauds the community spirit shown by local people in Tillydrone and the solidarity that has grown between the two communities as a result; welcomes the shipment from St George&rsquo;s Church on 31 October 2008 providing much needed equipment, toys, clothes and basic supplies for schools and community facilities in Bezallel, and looks forward to other such milestones in the years ahead.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2787</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>The Costs of Child Poverty in the UK</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the report published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on 23 October 2008 that estimated that child poverty costs the United Kingdom at least &pound;25 billion a year; notes the unacceptable costs of poverty, both to the UK Exchequer and to the victims of poverty; asserts that poverty, especially child poverty, is a pressing and pertinent issue in the UK and Scotland; considers that the only way to tackle poverty is to redistribute wealth; commends the Scottish Government for attempting to modernise local taxation and relate said taxation to an individual&rsquo;s ability to pay; calls on the UK Government to investigate methods of redistributing wealth, and notes that these methods could include a citizens&rsquo; income and should include the raising of extra funds to fight poverty by ending loopholes that allow the very wealthy to evade taxation.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2787.1</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>The Costs of Child Poverty in the UK</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2787) in the name of Bill Wilson, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;considers that the SNP government has decided to reward those who are better-off by offering them tax cuts and penalise the less well-off by cutting local services that many children, disabled and older people depend on; believes that a lack of government funding to local authorities is responsible for cuts to nursery places and a reduction in hours, school kitchen closures, reduced support for one-parent families and funding cuts to respite care services for disabled people as well as cuts to Sure Start funding for vulnerable children and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to use the budget process as an opportunity to revise its settlement with local government; notes, in addition, that the SNP government has delivered a schools settlement described as awful by EIS General Secretary Ronnie Smith, and further believes that these cuts have plunged more people into poverty rather than lifted them out, highlighting a stark contradiction to its claim to redistribute wealth.&quot;</p>
