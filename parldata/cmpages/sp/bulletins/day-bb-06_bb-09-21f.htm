<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4833&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>School Bus Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that in certain local authority areas in Ayrshire and elsewhere there is a concern about the need to tighten up the rules and guidelines regarding the safety of buses carrying children to school and, in particular, believes that the regulations should be changed so that it is mandatory for a supervising adult to accompany primary school children travelling on a school bus whether the bus is a single or double decker.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4832</strong> <strong>Euan Robson:</strong> <strong>Bookstart Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of sharing books with children and the benefits for all of Scotland&rsquo;s young children in having early and ready access to books via the Bookstart programme, which has been shown to raise parental awareness of the importance of early book sharing and believes that the benefits of packs of books delivered by Bookstart+, Treasure Chest and others should be available to every two and three-year-old in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4831&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Dental Health Services Research Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Dental Health Services Research Unit (DHSRU), based in Dundee University, on its various achievements in the last year, especially in winning, with collaborators, a &euro;1.8 million grant known as EGOHID II and the SCOT (Scottish Collaboration of Trialists) award of &pound;1.2 million; notes with pleasure the joint initiative of the University of Dundee and NHS Highland in their preparations for the appointment of a new Professor of Public Health Research and Consultant in Dental Public Health, and applauds the DHSRU&rsquo;s international recognition and invited involvement in National Institutes of Health funding for specific Cochrane Oral Health Group reviews in the area of oral cancer, its European Union funding with the University of Lyon and a range of partners across Europe to develop and operationalise European global oral health indicators across 25 member states, its invitation from the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry to help set out the direction of travel to protect oral health in the vulnerable child and its central involvement with US and Scandinavian partners in the International Caries Detection and Assessment System Group.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4830</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Privatisation of Dental Treatment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the creeping privatisation of dental services in the south of Scotland and elsewhere; notes that some dentists are being advised to encourage NHS patients to undertake unnecessary cosmetic dental treatment and that this advice is coming from private companies such as Integrated Dental Holdings, and calls on the Scottish Executive to condemn such practices and to put pressure on local NHS boards to ensure that all dentists are offered fair employment contracts based on their ability to practise and not on their capacity to foist unnecessary private treatment onto patients for the sake of profits.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4829</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Football in the Community Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the joint working of the First Base Agency, an agency working in the sphere of drug and alcohol support and based in Dumfries, and Gretna Football Club&rsquo;s Football in the Community Programme, using the prestige of the football club to promote positive messages to young people; also recognises similar good work by many other football clubs, using their name to attract young people to take part in constructive educational or recreational activities and anti-drugs and alcohol campaigns, and believes that some of the public money provided for activities of this sort could achieve excellent results and best value by being channelled into schemes which bring together the Scottish Executive, football clubs, local authorities and voluntary organisations to work with young people and attract additional funding from other commercial and charitable sources.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4828&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Life. Live It - British Red Cross</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the British Red Cross on its report, <em>Life. Live it</em>; notes that every year there are 5.5 million attendances at hospitals across the United Kingdom; agrees with the view that in many health emergencies interventions in the first few minutes, before the emergency services arrive, can make a crucial difference to the outcome for the casualty and that people in the UK should have basic first aid knowledge; notes that Norway, Denmark and France already teach first aid as a core part of the  school curriculum; congratulates New Zealand for measuring the impact of a public health campaign on first aid for burns; applauds all organisations similarly engaged in first aid activity, such as the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Ambulance in Cardenden where a new course for local people started on 18 September 2006, and hopes that the Scottish Executive will take the appropriate measures to ensure that schools, colleges, universities and workplaces make it a core part of their programme of activity to provide first aid education and training.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4827</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>St Andrew&rsquo;s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the St Andrew&rsquo;s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4826&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>European Day of Modern Languages 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that 26 September 2006 is the annual European Day of Modern Languages; believes that learning a modern language other than English is a vital tool in helping our young people to broaden their horizons and improve their employment opportunities; agrees that the teaching of European languages in schools raises awareness and understanding of Scotland&rsquo;s place in the European Union; notes the findings of a recent report from the European Parliament&rsquo;s Culture and Education Committee that member states should include at least two foreign languages from a very early age in their school programmes, and therefore welcomes the efforts of Scottish local authorities to improve language attainment in primary schools, such as North Ayrshire Council which has recently provided training for 18 primary teachers in the delivery of Spanish lessons, to complement the existing availability of French tuition at primary level.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4825</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Action on Darfur</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Amnesty International&rsquo;s reports during 2006 of the gross human rights abuses committed in Darfur and believes that pressure should be put on the Sudanese Government to protect the people of Darfur and ensure that their human rights are respected, to facilitate the immediate and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance and to bring to justice those responsible for committing human rights abuses.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4824</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>West Kilbride Craft and Design Town</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the West Kilbride Community Initiative and the townspeople of West Kilbride on their receipt of the Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s national accolade of the UK&rsquo;s official capital of enterprise; recognises the tremendous achievement of the town in winning this award in competition with some of the nation&rsquo;s most ambitious and most expensive entrepreneurial projects; believes that the example of West Kilbride can be used to regenerate other town centres in the west of Scotland and beyond; notes the contribution of Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire to community renewal and enterprise in West Kilbride, and calls on the Enterprise Network to support the next phase of development in West Kilbride and further roll out the lessons of West Kilbride more widely in west of Scotland communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4823</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Pay Up for Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses profound concern that local authorities have still not achieved equal pay for women despite decades of legislative requirement and a specific seven-year commitment included in the single status agreement; is appalled that, through the failure of authorities and government to plan for and resource equal pay, workers across Scotland, including women workers who are already low paid, are facing pay cuts and people who depend on services are facing service cuts; believes that, given the comparatively low levels of pay in Scotland for all workers, equal pay should be achieved by levelling up rather than down and that local authorities and the Scottish Executive have a duty to make the funding available to achieve that by negotiation; considers that, if sufficient funding is not made available, the employers and the Executive will be culpable for the industrial disputes and legal challenges that arise, and believes that it is in the Executive&rsquo;s and local authorities&rsquo; interests to avoid such disputes and legal challenges and that they should pay up for equal pay.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4810.1</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>A Greener, Fairer Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4810) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, insert at end &quot;believes that the building of new nuclear power stations would undermine Scotland&rsquo;s efforts to tackle climate change, and recognises that, to make an effective contribution towards the global campaign to tackle global warming, our Parliament requires the powers of other independent nations including responsibility for energy and fiscal policy.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4810.2</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>A Greener, Fairer Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4810) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the seriousness of climate change and the grave threat which it poses to humanity; notes the reality, as evidenced in the latest report from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, that it is vital to implement a major new programme of action to cut carbon emissions within the next four years if we are to play our part in keeping global temperatures below dangerous levels, and calls on the Scottish Executive to adopt a target for a 3% year-on-year overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and to take action to achieve this target including reducing road traffic levels, bold energy efficiency measures, promoting micropower technologies and decentralised energy generation, the rapid expansion of renewable energy and the carbon-proofing of all Executive decisions and policies to ensure a consistent rather than contradictory approach to emissions reduction.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4810.3</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>A Greener, Fairer Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4810) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;mankind&quot; to end and insert &quot;the planet; recognises that the Scottish Executive has already embodied fresh ideas, radical thinking and a uniquely Scottish approach in its response to this challenge in <em>Changing our Ways: Scotland&rsquo;s Climate Change Programme</em>, and welcomes the significant initiatives that the Executive has taken to increase the level of renewable energy generation, improve the energy efficiency of new buildings, boost micro-renewables, reduce energy poverty and increase investment in public transport, the introduction of Strategic Environmental Assessment and the promotion of sustainable development across its policies.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4809.1</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Airport Rail Link Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4809) in the name of Scott Barrie, insert at end &quot;but, in doing so, considers that inadequate information has been provided to the Parliament on the funding of the project and on alternative methods of establishing a rail link to Edinburgh Airport, and requests that further information is provided by the promoter and the Scottish Executive on these matters in the course of the Consideration Stage.&quot;</p>
