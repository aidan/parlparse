<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2635</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Scudamore Report into Foot and Mouth Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scudamore report&rsquo;s conclusions on Scotland&rsquo;s handling of the 2007 foot and mouth disease outbreak, contained in<em> Foot and Mouth Disease Review (Scotland) 2007, </em>and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to take the recommendations forward, including consideration of any potential opportunities for regionalisation and other steps to minimise the potential future disruption to the Scottish livestock industry.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2634</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Fife Fares, Not Fair</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the cost of travelling by train to and from Fife is often disproportionately greater than the cost of train journeys in other parts of Scotland; affirms its continued commitment to the promotion of environmentally friendly modes of transport, and supports the &quot;Fife fares, not fair&quot; campaign for cheaper train travel.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Tolson<strong>*</strong>, Mike Rumbles<strong>*</strong>, Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong>, Jeremy Purvis<strong>*</strong>, Liam McArthur<strong>*</strong>, Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2633</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>Support for Mordechai Vanunu</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s statement in support of Mordechai Vanunu, who was captured by the Israeli Government 22 years ago after exposing Israel&rsquo;s nuclear weapons programme; notes that he has been imprisoned and subsequently kept under house arrest for those 22 years without access to any foreign media or right to overseas travel; further notes his powerful stance on non-proliferation and the right of the Palestinian people to their own state, and supports the Scottish Government&rsquo;s actions in making representations to the Foreign Office urging it to lobby the Israeli Government to lift all restrictions on Vanunu.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2632</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Connage Crowdie Wins OK</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Connage Highland Dairy at Milton of Connage, Ardersier, on the achievement of its crowdie cheese winning the Best Cheese in Scotland category at the British Cheese Awards; recognises the scale of this achievement considering that the Clark family have only been making the hand-crafted organic cheeses for three years; wishes them the best of luck in the future, and recognises the quality and variety of food and drink that is produced in the Highlands and Islands.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2631</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>Local Government Finance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Government to publish in detail, prior to the introduction of a council tax abolition Bill, how it proposes to allocate to each local authority local income tax revenues and all other sources of funding, including revenue support grant and non-domestic rates income, in the event of the Bill being enacted.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2625</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the work of the organisation Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament (PNND); believes that work to achieve multilateral nuclear disarmament is of the utmost international importance; welcomes the cross-party, cross-ideological and international approach adopted by PNND to this issue; congratulates PNND for its work, and calls on all members of the Parliament with an interest in nuclear disarmament to consider endorsing the parliamentary statement supporting a nuclear weapons convention being circulated by PNND, which will be presented to the United Nations in October 2008 to support disarmament initiatives.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2624</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Crime Levels Hit a 25-Year Low</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the police, the Scottish Government, neighbourhood watch groups, community organisations and individuals who have contributed to Scotland having its lowest reported crime figures in more than a quarter of a century and believes that increased police numbers, tackling our booze and blade culture, the breaking up of organised crime gangs, additional prison places, the ending of automatic, unconditional early release and the move towards securing earlier guilty pleas will all go a long way to making our streets and communities safer while reducing the fear of crime that blights so many lives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2623</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Best High Performance Award for Ballyconnelly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ballyconnelly Developments of Inverclyde on winning Best High Performance category at The Herald Property Awards for Scotland 2008; notes the hard work of this small Inverclyde-based development company, which has shown innovative design and construction in building its Enkelt Living eco-friendly affordable homes, and further notes the importance of affordable housing in today&rsquo;s fluctuating property market.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Wilson<strong>*</strong>, Bob Doris<strong>*</strong>, Bashir Ahmad<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2622</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Independence is Bad News for Business</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments of Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, a former British ambassador to the United States of America and former head of the Diplomatic Service, regarding the negative impact that independence would have on Scotland; believes that inward investment from the United States could dry up if Scotland became independent; further believes that Scotland would have to leave the European Union with no guarantee that an application to rejoin would prove successful, putting in jeopardy rights to free movement of labour, a common market, joint action to tackle environmental hazards and other benefits of membership of the European Union; further notes with concern the news that the Republic of Ireland is now deemed to be a country in recession and that in Iceland interest rates have hit 15% and inflation 8%; also notes that these are both small independent countries that the SNP has long proclaimed form &quot;an arc of prosperity&quot;; believes that the SNP has never established whether it favours an Irish-style tax cutting economy or a higher tax Scandinavian-style social democracy because it cannot believe in both with any economic credibility, and concludes that the strength of the union of the United Kingdom has been the source of economic and political stability for Scotland for over 300 years and will see us through these difficult economic times.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2621</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Ending the Shame of Child Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with alarm statistics produced by the Campaign to End Child Poverty that show that Glasgow has the worst levels of child poverty in Scotland including large areas, such as Glasgow North East where 73% of children - 12,010 out of 16,435 - come from families that are either workless or in receipt of working tax credit, and smaller clusters, such as in north Barlanark and Easterhouse south where the proportion in workless families or in families on working tax credit is 98%; supports those involved in the United Kingdom&rsquo;s biggest ever event to end child poverty, at Trafalgar Square on Saturday 4 October 2008; further supports the call of the organisers of the march for the UK Government to spend just &pound;3 billion a year to reach its own target to halve child poverty by 2010 and stay on course to end child poverty altogether; believes that all governments and administrations in the UK should work positively together in order to address child poverty issues; acknowledges that this can mean different approaches and strategies within different areas of the UK, and further believes that an excellent example of this is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach, including moves to abolish prescription charges, extend entitlement to free school meals and school clothing grants, the freezing of the council tax and the introduction of direct payments to kinship carers of looked-after children.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2620</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Aleke Banda</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of Aleke Banda to retire from frontline politics in Malawi at the next election; recognises the role that he played in the campaign for independence for Malawi, helping to build a new country, and his 55 years in active politics; congratulates him on his achievements during his career, and wishes him well in his retirement, hoping that he will, in his own words, &quot;find the time to read some bedtime stories, to learn to kick a football or fly a kite&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2572</strong> <strong>Christopher Harvie:</strong> <strong>Return of the Rosyth-Zeebrugge Ferry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Government and Forth Ports on securing a new operator for the Rosyth-Zeebrugge ferry service, which will resume in spring 2009; welcomes the decision of the new ferry operator, Norfolkline, to deploy a new vessel on the route and match the schedule previously provided and hopes that it will consider an extension to the previous schedule; further hopes that this resumption of a direct maritime contact with Europe, with its beneficial impact on freight transport and tourism, will lead to increased prosperity for Rosyth, Fife and Scotland in general, and encourages the governments of Scotland and Flanders to mark the occasion of the resumption of the Rosyth-Zeebrugge ferry with a celebration commemorating Scotland&rsquo;s links with the Low Countries.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2572.1</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Return of the Rosyth-Zeebrugge Ferry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2572) in the name of Christopher Harvie, insert at end &quot;recognises that the gap between the original service ending and the new service starting will lead to companies making alternative logistical arrangements in the interim months, and urges the Scottish Government to work with Forth Ports and other relevant organisations to establish measures that will encourage such businesses back to Rosyth next spring.&quot;</p>
