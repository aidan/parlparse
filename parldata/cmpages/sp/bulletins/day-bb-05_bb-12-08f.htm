<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only  printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the  complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is  published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains any motions lodged  for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for  debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol  (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in  the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support  are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a  declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3703 Lewis Macdonald: The  Draft Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 (Modification of the  National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) Order 2005&mdash;</strong>That the Health  Committee recommends that the draft Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act  2004 (Modification of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) Order  2005 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr  Andy Kerr<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3702 Tommy Sheridan: Eviction  of Storrier Family&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the eviction of the Storrier  family and, in particular, Gladys Storrier, aged 71, from a ground floor  council home to a third-storey home two closes from the ground floor home;  believes that it is unacceptable to refuse in such a harsh fashion to accommodate  a pensioner with known illnesses; believes that the Storrier family should be  housed in a suitable ground floor home and that the shortage of such good  quality council homes across Dundee is indicative of a Scottish-wide problem  whereby the demand for good quality council and socially rented homes far  outstrips the supply, and therefore demands a massive council housing building  programme with no right-to-buy policy.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3701 Carolyn Leckie: TETRA  Masts Moratorium&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive, under  the proximity principle, to impose a moratorium on the building and planning of  all TETRA masts in Scotland and to undertake an immediate review into the  potential health hazards of long and short-term exposure to electromagnetic  fields at all relevant frequencies from TETRA masts and to provide information  to the public on the health impacts of electromagnetic fields and the measures  taken to address them.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3700# Mrs Mary Mulligan: Linlithgow  Primary School Volunteers&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the children of  Linlithgow Primary School who were honoured by Historic Scotland this week, on  International Volunteer Day, for the tremendous work they do as tour guides  around Linlithgow Palace and further commends their volunteering to other young  people as a way of developing personal skills, but also of establishing a pride  in the history of their own town or community.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald  Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3699 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Scotch  Beef&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the Minister for Environment and  Rural Development in getting beef produce back into European markets by holding  a successful banquet of Scottish produce in Brussels last week; notes that,  prior to the beef ban being implemented, beef exports provided a multi-million  pound input into the Scottish economy; agrees that an increase in beef exports  will give a much-needed boost to the Scottish farming industry; further  welcomes increasing confidence in Scotch beef, and agrees that the development  of a reinvigorated market in beef will be good for Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3698# Mr Andrew Welsh: Gas  Work Notification Scheme&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern the introduction  by CORGI of a mandatory notification scheme for all new gas installations in  April of this year; further notes that, whilst supporting all measures which  genuinely improve gas safety standards, the Gas Work Notification Scheme does  not serve to improve standards or to tackle cowboy traders, that it was  conceived around the requirements of the Home Information Pack which will apply  only in England and Wales and that it places a wholly unnecessary time and cost  burden on Scottish registered gas installers, which in turn places an  additional cost burden on their major customers, such as Scottish housing  associations and local authorities, with no benefit to the Scottish customer;  is concerned at the implications of the scheme for gas installers and consumers  in Angus; is further concerned that the scheme was introduced by CORGI without  due consultation with Scottish member organisations, and considers that the  Scottish Executive should ensure that this scheme is withdrawn from Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3697 Chris Ballance: Peace  Workers in Iraq&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the plight of the four hostages  in Iraq, who were working for Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT), including US  Green Party member and Quaker, Tom Fox; notes that the four CPT members were  travelling unarmed and without bodyguards, which is inconsistent with the  accusation that they are spies or acting in any capacity with the US Government  or armed forces;&nbsp;applauds the brave work of all those who are committed to  front-line peacekeeping around the world, and joins with the over 20,000  people, including Tariq Ali, Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Ralph Nader, who  have signed a petition calling for the immediate release of these hostages so  that they can continue their essential work as witnesses and peacemakers in  Iraq.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3696 Ms Sandra White: Disability  and Income Poverty&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the Joseph Rowntree Foundation  report, <em>Monitoring poverty and social  exclusion in Scotland 2005</em>, which was released in early December; further  notes that the report highlights the fact that &ldquo;A third of all (both workless  and working) working-age disabled adults in Scotland live in income poverty,  double the rate for their non-disabled counterparts and higher than the rates  for either pensioners or children&rdquo;, and considers this to be a matter of grave  concern and believes that the Scottish Executive should be looking into the  causes of this as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3695 Bill Butler: Christina  Gorbachova, Drumchapel High School Pupil&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the  news that Christina Gorbachova, a pupil from Drumchapel High School, and her  parents, Andre and Tanya, from Belarus have been released from Yarl&rsquo;s Wood  Detention Centre and allowed to return to Glasgow pending a review of their  case by the Home Office; congratulates her fellow pupils and the wider  Drumchapel community for their efforts on the family&rsquo;s behalf; hopes that the  review of their case by the Home Office results in the granting of leave to  remain in Scotland; acknowledges the urgent need for an agreement to be reached  with the Home Office which puts in place arrangements that protect the welfare  of all children in asylum cases and takes into account the time spent in  Scotland, and calls for negotiations taking place to arrive at such an  agreement to be concluded as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3691 Mrs Nanette Milne: Dogs  Trust Campaign 2005&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the Dogs Trust 2005  campaign, &ldquo;A dog is still for life, not just for Christmas&rdquo;; notes that the  Christmas campaign aims to raise awareness of the consequences of treating dogs  as gifts or toys; further notes that each year hundreds of dogs and puppies are  still presented as gifts, of which a significant number are subsequently  abandoned, and recognises the hard work of dog rescue centres across Scotland  in the rehabilitation and rehoming of abandoned dogs.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3684.2 Shona Robison: Future  Arrangements for Health Services in the Argyll and Clyde Area&mdash;</strong>As an  amendment to motion (S2M-3684) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from  first &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;regrets the failure of the Scottish  Executive to direct effectively the management of Argyll and Clyde NHS Board  prior to its reorganisation of December 2002 and the continuing lack of  direction and support that resulted in the Executive&rsquo;s decision to dissolve the  board two years and five months later in May 2005 and to redraw the boundaries  of the neighbouring boards to take over its responsibilities from April 2006; applauds  the continued successful efforts of staff in NHS Argyll and Clyde during these  difficult times to maintain comprehensive healthcare services for the people of  the area; demands clear evidence that input from the public consultation on the  boundary option to be adopted has been fully and objectively considered;  supports NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow in their task of returning  services to financial balance while maintaining high standards of quality and  access, and demands that the Executive provides these boards with adequate  support and more effective leadership and direction that will assist them to  address credibly the structural and financial problems in NHS Argyll and Clyde.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3684.3 Frances Curran: Future  Arrangements for Health Services in the Argyll and Clyde Area&mdash;</strong>As an  amendment to motion (S2M-3684) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from  first &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;believes that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s  decision to dissolve Argyll and Clyde NHS board was hasty and the subsequent  consultation document issued concerning the new boundary options for the  services provided by NHS Argyll and Clyde was completely inadequate, lacking  both financial information and possible impact assessment on service provision  from a reallocation of resources to NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow;  further believes that no-one responding to the consultation could reach an  informed view on these issues; therefore calls for this information to be  placed in the public domain before any decision, which could have a major  impact on jobs and services within the existing Argyll and Clyde NHS board  area, is taken by the Executive, and applauds the work of the existing staff to  continue to provide health care services within NHS Argyll and Clyde despite  the enormous uncertainty that they feel about their own employment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3684.4 Miss Annabel Goldie: Future Arrangements for Health Services in the Argyll and Clyde Area&mdash;</strong>As  an amendment to motion (S2M-3684) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from  first &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;applauds the efforts of all clinicians and  staff in NHS Argyll and Clyde, at this unsettling time, to maintain the  delivery of services; expresses profound concern about the inadequate nature of  the consultation process concerning the future of NHS Argyll and Clyde; believes  that the consultation paper lacked both a clear analysis of the structural and  financial problems facing the existing NHS board and any robust information  about the implications of revised NHS board areas for acute hospital services,  which the public needs to make informed choices about the options presented,  and therefore calls for the necessary analysis and information to be provided  for the public as a matter of urgency and for the consultation to be reopened,  in order that informed decisions can be made.&rdquo;</p>
