<p><strong>9.00 am&#9;</strong>Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Ministerial Statement: Creative Scotland</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Government Debate: Hospital Waiting Times&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3848</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Hospital Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the most recent progress that has been made in reducing waiting times for patients; applauds the commitment, dedication and hard work of all NHS staff who have contributed to delivering these significant improvements for the people of Scotland; notes the progress made by the previous administration; acknowledges the substantial investment being made to increase NHSScotland capacity and the continuing work on integrating, modernising and redesigning services to speed access, diagnosis and treatment, and supports the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to deliver a maximum &quot;whole journey&quot; waiting time of 18 weeks by 2011. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3848.3</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Hospital Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3848) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;while welcoming the extension of the waiting times guarantee to include child and adolescent mental health services<font color="#0000ff">,</font> calls on the Scottish Government to consider extending the range of specialties to include adult mental health services; further calls on the Scottish Government to ensure sufficient resources to bring NHSScotland in line as soon as possible with the NHS in England where a &quot;whole journey&quot; national waiting time standard of 18 weeks was delivered by December 2008, and notes that this compares to a target of 18 months introduced by the previous Conservative administration.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3848.1</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Hospital Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3848) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;staff&quot; to end and insert &quot;and independent sector staff who have contributed to delivering these significant improvements for the people of Scotland; notes the progress made by the previous administration; acknowledges the substantial investment being made to increase NHSScotland capacity and the continuing work on integrating, modernising and redesigning services to speed access, diagnosis and treatment, but cautions that, while shorter waiting times are welcome, patient care and health outcomes should not be jeopardised by attempts to meet centrally determined targets.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-3848.2</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Hospital Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3848) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;but believes that the achievement of maximum waiting times should ultimately be at the discretion of clinicians to protect those with the greatest clinical need.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>2.55 pm</strong>&#9;Scottish Government Debate: Antisocial Behaviour Framework&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3849</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the new Antisocial Behaviour Framework, <em>Promoting Positive Outcomes: Working Together to Prevent Antisocial Behaviour in Scotland</em>, which has been developed in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) and other national partners; further notes that it builds on the success achieved since the Parliament introduced the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004; agrees that antisocial behaviour blights the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and should not be tolerated but believes that prevention is better than cure when it comes to protecting communities from disorder; values the cross-party and cross-organisational input and support that the framework has received; appreciates the wealth of good practice across Scotland and the importance of replicating it as widely as possible, and embraces the framework&rsquo;s commitment through enhanced prevention, integration, community engagement and communication to making our communities safer and stronger. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3849.2</strong> <strong>Paul Martin: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3849) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that too many communities in Scotland are still blighted by antisocial behaviour and recognises that the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 was a response to these concerns; further believes that there should not be reduced use of legal remedies, which have been effective in providing individuals and communities with relief from the selfish activities of a minority; recognises that while the Antisocial Behaviour Framework is right to highlight good practice and preventative measures, such initiatives must be properly resourced; acknowledges that, while only a small minority of young people engage in antisocial behaviour, parental responsibility is crucial in addressing this problem, and believes in widening access to legal remedies for communities that wish to tackle problems of antisocial behaviour in their areas.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3849.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3849) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;it builds&quot; to end and insert &quot;the success of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 has not been universal; agrees that antisocial behaviour blights the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and should not be tolerated but believes that prevention is better than cure when it comes to protecting communities from disorder and encourages communities to report all incidents of crime and disorder so that they can be properly addressed, and appreciates the wealth of good practice followed in some areas of Scotland and the importance of replicating it as widely as possible.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3849.3</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3849) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;; welcomes the framework&rsquo;s emphasis on addressing the causes of antisocial behaviour, such as drug and alcohol addiction and deprivation, and on improving life chances; supports the promotion of the new prevention, early intervention, enforcement and rehabilitation (PIER) model, including the use of acceptable behaviour contracts pioneered by Liberal Democrats in Islington, and regards increased community involvement and empowerment as vital components of success in action to tackle antisocial behaviour.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong>&#9;Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#9;Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-3000</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Huntington&rsquo;s Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that Huntington&rsquo;s disease is a devastating, high-risk, inherited, neurological condition that causes a profound form of dementia and mental ill health; notes that the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association (SHA), based in Paisley, was established in 1989 by families living with the disease because they could not get help with health and social care services; congratulates SHA in approaching its 20th anniversary in 2009 and on providing Huntington&rsquo;s disease services staffed by skilled nurses that make a significant difference to the lives of those affected by the disease; expresses its concern that only nine out of the 15 NHS boards provide this service, and considers that all people living with the condition would benefit from access to the type of support provided by SHA.</p>
