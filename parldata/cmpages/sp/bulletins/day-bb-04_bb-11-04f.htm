          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-1949</strong> <STRONG>Murdo Fraser:</STRONG> <STRONG>Re-election of President George W Bush</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates President George W Bush on his re-election for a further four years; notes that the Republicans&rsquo; effective and successful campaign saw President Bush decisively win the popular vote throughout the country as well as the Republicans maintaining control of, and increasing their representation in, both the Senate and the House of Representatives, ensuring stable government, and congratulates both Republicans and Democrats for running a high-profile campaign that has resulted in such a high turn-out of voters thus giving added credibility to the result.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1948#</strong> <STRONG>Roseanna Cunningham:</STRONG> <STRONG>21st Century City of Courtesy</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the people of Perth on being the first Scottish community to be awarded the title 21st Century City of Courtesy by the Campaign for Courtesy; notes the importance of tourism and service industries to the Perth economy, and hopes that many more Scottish towns and cities will follow the courteous lead that Perth has shown.</p>

          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-1947</strong> <STRONG>Helen Eadie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Safety of Forth Bridge</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to secure an urgent inspection by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Rail Inspectorate of track and rail infrastructure for the Forth Bridge and all track and rail lines in the immediate vicinity and thereafter to provide a comprehensive report on the safety of all lines and infrastructure across Scotland as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1946</strong> <STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</STRONG> <STRONG>Designation of Lead Committee</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Justice 2 Committee be designated as lead committee in consideration of the draft Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2004.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-1945</strong> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Regulation of Security Firms</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament urges the Executive to bring forward legislation, as has been done for England and Wales, to regulate security firms more tightly.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1944</strong> <STRONG>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</STRONG> <STRONG>All Councils Must Support Scottish Troops</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the decision of Glasgow City Council to award Territorial Army (TA) personnel serving in Iraq up to 50% council tax relief; deplores the fact that, while convicted criminals are given discounts, Scottish TA soldiers are denied exemptions while on active service in Iraq; demands that local authorities stop hiding behind the fact that there is no legal requirement for granting these exemptions and instead support Scottish troops rather than penalising them, and calls on all local authorities in Scotland to follow Glasgow&rsquo;s lead and award council tax discounts to TA personnel serving in Iraq.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-1943.1</strong> <STRONG>Christine Grahame:</STRONG> <STRONG>Domestic Abuse Services</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1943) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;and welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses its concern, however, at the level of secure funding to agencies working in this area and the lack of suitably-located alternative accommodation for the victims of domestic abuse, particularly those with children; further expresses concern that services for elderly people who are victims of domestic abuse are even more limited, and commends the role of Tayside Domestic Abuse Service, the only service of its kind in Scotland where police and a voluntary organisation work together to support the victims of abuse, as a model of effective partnership working.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1943.2</strong> <STRONG>Margaret Mitchell:</STRONG> <STRONG>Domestic Abuse Services</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1943) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes with grave concern the escalating pattern of repeat victimisation highlighting the fact that more and more victims are trapped in abusive situations; acknowledges and welcomes the range of initiatives in this area that have been funded by the Scottish Executive in the last few years, and calls on the Executive to continue to explore different means to raise awareness of the issue generally and to ensure that individuals who are trapped in abusive situations are aware of these support services to help them escape from their abusive circumstances.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1943.3</strong> <STRONG>Shiona Baird:</STRONG> <STRONG>Domestic Abuse Services</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1943) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes with concern that, despite Scottish Executive initiatives, domestic abuse continues to be widespread; recognises the recent public opinion poll from Amnesty International showing the level of complacency in society about domestic abuse; believes that tackling domestic abuse will require concerted effort by the Executive including a continued focus on public education and awareness-raising, in particular focusing on education and involving non-perpetrating men, along with extending support for those experiencing domestic abuse; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s recent announcement of &pound;6 million funding for children and young people experiencing domestic abuse but calls on the Executive to detail as soon as possible how this funding will be allocated; notes with concern that there is no national funding strategy for domestic abuse services, that funding for Women&rsquo;s Aid groups throughout Scotland is often on a yearly basis and that the quality of service varies widely according to local authority area and calls on the Executive to put in place a national funding strategy, and recognises that, to tackle domestic abuse effectively, Executive policy-making needs to take into account the interlinkages between all types of gender-based violence and continue to broaden its focus to encompass to all forms of violence against women including those in vulnerable minorities.&quot;</p>

          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-1940.1</strong> <STRONG>Mary Scanlon:</STRONG> <STRONG>A Better Deal for Pensioners</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;condemns the Chancellor&rsquo;s promotion of the means test which acts as a major disincentive to save; believes that linking the basic state pension to earnings would lift a million pensioners out of means-testing over a four year period; calls for greater measures to encourage personal savings, and acknowledges that only a Conservative administration at Westminster can implement these changes for the benefit of all Scotland&rsquo;s pensioners.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1940.2</strong> <STRONG>John Swinburne:</STRONG> <STRONG>A Better Deal for Pensioners</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;and restore the link, broken in 1982, between pensions and average national earnings.&quot;</p>
          <p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Dr Jean Turner<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Dennis Canavan<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Margo MacDonald<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-1940.3</strong> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan:</STRONG> <STRONG>A Better Deal for Pensioners</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;removing&quot; to end and insert &quot;the introduction of a basic state pension of &pound;150 a week to be raised annually thereafter in line with the average rise in earnings would help achieve both of these objectives, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring pressure to bear on the UK Government to begin the process of replacing means-testing with an earnings-linked state pension.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1940.4</strong> <STRONG>Robert Brown:</STRONG> <STRONG>A Better Deal for Pensioners</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the progress made by the Scottish Executive in ensuring a better deal for pensioners through the introduction of free personal care, a national free off-peak bus scheme and a free central heating and insulation scheme; recognises that pensions policy is reserved to the UK Government; believes that the UK government&rsquo;s policy on pensions has failed as nearly 2 million pensioners are missing out on the pension credits that they are entitled to and deserve due to demeaning and unworkable means-testing, and further believes that the state pension must be reformed to ensure that everyone has a decent income in retirement by implementing the Liberal Democrat proposal for a Citizen&rsquo;s Pension, initially for those over 75, with entitlement based on residency and not National Insurance contributions, restoring the link between earnings and pensions, making older pensioners better off by &pound;25 per week for single pensioners and lifting one million UK pensioners out of means-testing.&quot;</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1940.5</strong> <STRONG>Karen Whitefield:</STRONG> <STRONG>A Better Deal for Pensioners</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the vision of a Scotland in which every older person matters and every person beyond working age has a decent quality of life; considers that older people&rsquo;s lives have been improved through devolution across a wide range of areas such as health, transport, housing, social justice, volunteering, lifelong learning and tackling anti-social behaviour; recognises the range of measures specifically designed to improve the quality of life of all older people in Scotland, including free personal care for the elderly, free off-peak local bus travel, the central heating programme and funding for the Warm Deal; endorses the partnership between the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to tackle pensioner poverty, and welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s continuing commitment to improving the lives of all of Scotland&rsquo;s senior citizens.&quot;</p>
