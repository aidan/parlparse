<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (u).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>S2M-3399 Margaret Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab): </strong>That the Parliament condemns the comments of Sir John Ward, Chairman of Scottish Enterprise, at a briefing of MSPs on Wednesday 5 October 2005 when he stated that the economy of Ayrshire was like that of an Eastern European country, and calls on the current Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning to direct Scottish Enterprise and Sir John Ward to undertake the commitments given by Jim Wallace, the then Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, to improve the economy of Ayrshire.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alex Neil*, Mark Ballard*</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3398</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Breast Cancer: An Enviromental Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication, and notes with grave concern the findings, of <em>Breast Cancer: an environmental disease - the case for primary prevention </em>by the UK Working Group on the Primary Prevention of Breast Cancer; notes that breast cancer is the most common cancer in the United Kingdom; further notes that the chances of women contracting breast cancer rose from one in 12 to one in nine in the five-year period from 1996 to 2001; takes note of the working group&rsquo;s assertion that breast cancer is a preventable rather than an inevitable disease; takes further note of the working group&rsquo;s emphasis on the significance of low-level, long-term and early-life exposures to environmental agents in promoting this disease and the need to reduce the production, release and use of toxic substances; notes with concern that the proposals submitted to the European Commission could end up moving the burden-of-proof responsibilities, envisaged in Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH), back to public authorities instead of to chemicals producers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to prioritise the primary prevention of breast cancer and to make representations to ensure that the REACH regime can provide an adequate regulatory framework to assist with the prevention of breast cancer and other diseases with environmental components.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3397</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mr Charlie Gordon be appointed to replace Karen Gillon on the European and External Relations Committee.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3396</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mr Charlie Gordon be appointed to the Public Petitions Committee.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3395</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Karen Gillon be appointed to the Enterprise and Culture Committee.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3394</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Improve Broiler Chicken Welfare</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the intensive farming of chicken for meat production is one of the least regulated areas of food production within the whole livestock industry; notes that immense suffering, including lameness and brittle bones, can be caused to broiler chickens through genetic selection for fast growth and high stocking densities; believes that the proposed EU directive on the welfare of broiler chickens is a welcome first step in the raising of broiler chicken welfare standards across the whole European Union (EU), and calls on the Scottish Executive to urge the UK Government to use its Presidency of the EU to demand genuine improvements in broiler chicken welfare.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3393</strong>u <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Estonian Days in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament extends a warm welcome to those taking part in &quot;Estonian Days in Scotland&quot;, which is being held from 1 to 9 November 2005 at venues all over Scotland; believes that the extensive programme of events covering business development, cultural and sporting links is a worthy successor to the successful Scottish week in Tallinn, Estonia, that was organised in 2004; welcomes, in particular, the Foreign Minister and Culture Minister from the Estonian Government to Scotland and hopes that their visits are successful in broadening the political and cultural links between our two countries in the future; notes that Estonian and Scottish businesses have been quick to recognise the benefits to both countries in a closer relationship, and hopes that this will continue to grow in the years ahead as our small nations work together to develop fresh markets throughout the European Union and beyond.</p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3391</strong>u <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Common Good Funds - Where are They?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the existence of many local common good funds, such as those in Peebles and other Borders towns, comprising movable and heritable property and revenues but notes that there is often no comprehensive inventory of those assets which might not even be insured; notes that these often have considerable monetary as well as historic value; notes further that there are recorded instances of disposals of common good assets which should not have occurred, and considers therefore, as a first step, that the Scottish Executive should require local authorities to provide, as soon as practicable, a publicly accessible inventory of those common good assets in their stewardship.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3390</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Maternity Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the public consultation process on the reform of maternity services in Glasgow; notes that NHS Greater Glasgow attempted to rule out all but one of the potential sites for the new maternity hospital at a recent public meeting; notes that the independent group, chaired by Professor Calder, which is tasked with selecting the final site, appears to have a difficult job in light of this decision as their options have been limited; further notes the Minister for Health and Community Care&rsquo;s statement that &quot;I will decide what happens on these services, not Greater Glasgow Health Board&quot; and believes that it is his duty to ensure that the process is more open and transparent than it has been to date and that all the relevant information regarding the resiting of the children&rsquo;s hospital in Glasgow is considered by the independent group chaired by Professor Calder, and further believes that transport links and the future of Ronald McDonald House must also be given careful consideration.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3389</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body:</strong> <strong>Scottish Commission for Public Audit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body&rsquo;s proposal to appoint Margaret Smith to be a member of the Scottish Commission for Public Audit.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3381.1</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Scottish Olympic Team</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3381) in the name of Michael Matheson, leave out from &quot;London&quot; to end and insert &quot;the Great British effort, led by Sebastian Coe, which secured the 2012 Olympic Games for London; recognises that this will greatly encourage young people from Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and England to participate in sport and in the quest for Olympic glory for individuals and Team GB; acknowledges the pride of the many Scots who have competed successfully for Team GB; notes that different loyalties do not have to be divided loyalties and that many sports have traditionally been played at GB level, a structure which has served the United Kingdom, athletes and Scottish sport well since the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896; welcomes the news that Hampden Park will host the Olympic football and urges the Scottish Executive to promote other venues in Scotland, such as mountain biking at Fort William, rowing at Strathclyde Park and equestrianism at Gleneagles; further notes that Scottish athletes who compete for Great Britain under the Union Jack do not cease to be Scottish, and believes that, by pooling resources and expertise, Great Britain can compete successfully against much larger nations, providing invaluable experience for the athletes and a source of great national pride for sports fans.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3381.2</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Olympic Team</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3381) in the name of Michael Matheson, leave out from &quot;recent launch&quot; to end, and insert, &quot;Scottish bid to secure the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014; recognises that these two events would provide an unparalleled opportunity within the United Kingdom for Scots to perform at the highest level, and notes that both events would provide a major impetus to participation and performance in sport at all levels, with all the health and other benefits that brings.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3377.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3377) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;regrets&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes, however, that under the stewardship of the Scottish Executive economic growth has consistently trailed that of the United Kingdom; believes that independence would be a costly and unwelcome distraction from the concrete action that can be taken within the devolved framework to boost economic growth, and therefore urges the Executive to cut red tape, privatise Scottish Water, increase investment in transport and cut business rates at the earliest possible opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3377.2</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3377) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;create conditions&quot; to end and insert &quot;help create the conditions that foster a sustainable economy, rising living standards and an improving quality of life and welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Executive to sustainable economic growth, record levels of investment in public infrastructure and transport connections, its support for competitive business, skills development, training and education, and its promotion of Scotland as a vibrant place to live, work and do business.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3356.2</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>St Andrew&rsquo;s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3356) in the name of Dennis Canavan, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end, and insert &quot;notes that the Enterprise and Culture Committee supports the principles of the Bill; believes that St Andrew&rsquo;s Day should be a day of national celebration and strongly supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to achieving this objective; notes that the Enterprise and Culture Committee&rsquo;s Stage 1 report concludes that the Bill does not fulfil this purpose and would not place a statutory obligation on employers to grant St Andrew&rsquo;s Day as part of employee holiday entitlement; seeks to uphold the consensus across the Parliament that we should only legislate where necessary and when we can give effect to that legislation; believes that there is further work to be done to develop proposals to celebrate St Andrew&rsquo;s Day; agrees to refer the St Andrew&rsquo;s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill back to the Enterprise and Culture Committee for a further report on the general principles, and considers that further proposals should be developed for the celebration of St Andrew&rsquo;s Day.&quot;</p>
