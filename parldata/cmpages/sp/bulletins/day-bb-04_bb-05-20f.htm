            Regulation of the Security Industry</strong>-<A NAME="IntroText"></A>That 
            the Parliament congratulates Frontline Scotland for highlighting the 
            risks posed by unregulated security firms with links to underworld 
            figures; notes with concern that the services of some of these firms 
            have been retained by major organisations funded from public monies, 
            and believes that it is the duty of the Scottish Executive to introduce 
            legislation on regulating the security industry in order to ensure 
            that this sector does not become the preserve of organised crime.</P>
          <p></P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1344</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Parental 
            Involvement</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the case 
            of the 14-year-old girl in England who had an abortion arranged for 
            her by her school health worker without parental notification or consent; 
            acknowledges, while recognising the current role of health workers 
            and teachers in sexual health education, the pre-eminent role of parents, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that no such practices 
            will be allowed to occur in Scotland as part of the sexual health 
            strategy.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1343</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Israel 
            and War Crimes</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continued illegal 
            occupation of Palestinian territories by the Israeli Army and the 
            indiscriminate killing of men, women and children within the occupied 
            territories and the deliberate destruction of over 3,000 Palestinian 
            homes over the last three-and-a-half years; condemns the most recent 
            killings of 19 Palestinians by the Israeli army, including 15-year-old 
            Asmaa al Mughayer and her 13-year-old brother Ahmed who were shot 
            through the head by Israeli Army snipers while on the roof of their 
            home; believes, given the indiscriminate killings and deliberate demolition 
            of so many Palestinians' homes, that the Israeli Government, and Prime 
            Minister Ariel Sharon, in particular, are guilty of war crimes through 
            breach of Article 53 of the Geneva Convention, which states that &quot;Any 
            destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging 
            individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, 
            or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, 
            is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely 
            necessary by military operations&quot;; believes that Israel's actions 
            are not justified military operations and therefore condemns its actions 
            as unacceptable war crimes; agrees to communicate its disgust over 
            the Israeli Government's actions to the British Prime Minister and 
            directly to the Israeli embassy, and further agrees to investigate 
            a Scottish parliamentary boycott of Israeli goods in protest at their 
            actions.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1342</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Dietary 
            Needs of Infants in Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is concerned about the health and well-being of two-year-old 
            Eric Nakimbugwe who was recently removed from Dungavel House Immigration 
            Removal Centre with his mother, Deborah, where, due to inadequate 
            provision of food suitable for the dietary needs of infants, the child 
            has lost weight which is causing his mother great concern; demands, 
            furthermore, that Her Majesty's Government hands over powers to the 
            Parliament in order to allow it to take action in relation to this 
            and other child protection issues that are outside its powers, and 
            recognises that the children of detainees in Dungavel should be allotted 
            the same levels of protection and care as any other children in Scotland.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1341.1</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> 
            <strong>Major Events and Festivals in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment

            the festivals and events throughout Scotland over many years, created 
            and contributed to by a variety of organisations, whether central 
            or local government, national or area tourist boards or private or 
            public bodies; notes that the impediment to further success has been 
            a shortage of funds and that the creation of an additional and unnecessary 
            tier of bureaucracy is not the solution, and calls for the abolition 
            of EventScotland and the creation of an event fund for appropriate 
            organisations and bodies to access in order to continue and build 
            upon the success to date.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1341.2</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Major 
            Events and Festivals in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to motion 
            (S2M-1341) in the name of Mr Frank McAveety, insert at end &quot;further 
            notes that EventScotland's mission statement encompasses environmental 
            as well as other benefits and that the Scottish Executive's major 
            events strategy, while mentioning sustainability and affordability, 
            places these items 11th and 16th respectively out of a total of 16 
            priorities, and calls on the Executive, through bodies such as EventScotland 
            and VisitScotland, to work to ensure that environmental and community 
            benefits are not given a lower priority in the quest to attract prestige 
            events.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1340.1</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Skills

            to end and insert &quot;regrets the absence of a national skills and 
            lifelong learning strategy from the Scottish Executive as part of 
            the Smart, Successful Scotland policy; recognises the contribution 
            of the Scottish Union Learning Fund, the Scottish Credit and Qualifications 
            Framework, the Determined to Succeed programme and the Modern Apprenticeship 
            programme, but notes that these individual elements by themselves 
            will not deliver the appropriate skills and continued learning requirements 
            for Scotland in the 21st century.&quot;</P>

            <strong>64th Anniversary of the 51st Highland Division's Rearguard 
            Action at St Val&eacute;ry</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the sacrifice made by the 51st<SUP> </SUP>Highland Division in June 
            1940 as they assisted the French Army in making a stand against the 
            German invasion, relieving the pressure on the Channel ports, action 
            which ultimately lead to the capture of the division at St Val&eacute;ry-en-Caux; 
            further recognises that this action by the 51st Highland Division 
            helped win time for the Royal Navy to evacuate over 300,000 British 
            and French soldiers from Dunkirk; notes that, without the evacuation 
            from Dunkirk, Britain and her allies might well not have been able 
            to regroup and reorganise and ultimately return to French soil in 
            1944; recognises how different Britain, and indeed Europe, might have 
            been today without this vital contribution, and invites the First 
            Minister, when he takes part on behalf of the Scottish people in commemorative 
            activities to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day, to also pay tribute 
            to the 51st Highland Division's contribution to the evacuation from 
            Dunkirk and then ultimately to the success of D-Day.</P>

            to place on record its abiding gratefulness to those fellow Scots 
            who, some 60 years ago along with their *comrades* from the allied 
            nations, turned the tide and destroyed the evil of Nazism and fascism 
            in Europe and, in bringing an end to that terrible war, assisted with 
            the new accord within Europe that has eventually, and not without 
            struggle of a different kind, led to the European Union of 25 nations, 
            based upon equality and fraternity that has, as one of its major aims, 
            the elimination of poverty within its member states and elsewhere 
            in the world.</P>
