<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for  debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol  (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in  the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party  support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a  declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3846 Eleanor Scott: Legislate  for Better Health&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees with Dr Peter Terry, chairman  of the British Medical Association in Scotland, that a long-term public health  strategy can be effective only if there is a co-ordinated approach across all  ministerial portfolios; notes that decisions taken in other policy areas have a  significant bearing on public health; agrees on the need to develop synergistic  policies and cross-departmental co-operation, and calls on the Scottish  Executive to introduce a system of routine health impact assessments to be  applied to all policies and legislation. <strong>R</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3845 Carolyn Leckie: The  Local Government Pension Scheme and Abolition of Rule of 85&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament is concerned to learn of the contents of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s  answer to question S2W-21675 by Mr Tom McCabe on 17 January 2006 with reference  to changes to the Scottish Local Government Pension Scheme; regrets the  Executive&rsquo;s manner of announcing its support for the abolition of Rule of 85,  which would cause detriment to 200,000 local government workers; believes that  this demonstrates a lack of respect for local government workers, their  representatives, employers and COSLA; believes that it is a misjudgement on the  part of the Executive to disregard the views and legal opinions presented by  COSLA and UNISON; further believes that the Executive should take urgent action  to redress the harm caused by the content of the answer and manner of the  announcement; is concerned about other measures to erode local government  pensions; supports local government workers in their efforts to protect their  pensions and rights, and considers that the Executive should initiate urgent  discussions with COSLA and the trade unions to achieve a solution agreeable to  all.</p>
<p>Supported by: Frances  Curran<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3844 John Home Robertson: Offensive Comments in the name of Sandra White MSP&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament condemns the description in the name of Sandra White MSP of the  Union Flag as a &ldquo;butcher&rsquo;s apron&rdquo;; believes that the comments demonstrate small-minded  Scottish nationalism at its worst; calls on Ms White to withdraw the statement  and to apologise for this offensive slur on the flag of the Royal Scots, who  were deployed to Iraq last week, and of countless Scottish service personnel in  the British armed forces, including those who played such a prominent part in  the defeat of Nazism, and urges Alex Salmond MP and Nicola Sturgeon MSP to  repudiate this disgraceful attack on the Union Flag.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3843 Nora Radcliffe: The  Race Equality Review and the Fresh Talent Initiative&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes  the publication of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s race equality review and its  associated programme of action; is committed to a diverse, equal and integrated  Scotland; endorses the Commission for Racial Equality&rsquo;s view, expressed in its  report, <em>Broadening our Horizons - Making Fresh Talent work for Scotland</em>,  that integrated societies do not emerge by themselves, and calls on the  Executive to implement the action programme speedily and thoroughly to ensure  that everyone living in Scotland, or who comes to live in Scotland under the  aegis of the Fresh Talent initiative or for any other reason, has the support  he or she needs to develop to his or her full potential within our society.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3842 Brian Adam: Keep  Aberdeen&rsquo;s School Playgrounds and Playing Fields Open&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament  condemns Aberdeen City Council&rsquo;s Liberal Democrat/Tory administration for  attempting to restrict access to school playgrounds and playing fields after  school hours; commends the SNP and Labour groups and the external members of  the Education and Leisure Committee for voting against this ludicrous idea and  congratulates them on their victory; notes that the closing of playgrounds and  playing fields goes against the grain of health policies that are being  promoted, and calls on the Liberal/Tory administration to abide by this  democratic decision and not to attempt to overturn it at full council.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3841 Mrs Nanette Milne: Macmillan  Cancer Relief Cancertalk Week 2006&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that Macmillan  Cancer Relief will hold its Cancertalk Week from 23 to 27 January 2006,  including the Big Hush, a sponsored silence, on Friday 27 January;  congratulates it on helping children to increase their awareness of the disease  and reduce the fear surrounding it; notes that Cancertalk Week is a great  opportunity for schools and youth groups to talk about the issues surrounding  cancer, dispel myths about it and help people living with cancer, and  encourages MSPs to support local events and activities throughout the week.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3840&lt;&gt; Alex Johnstone: Scotland&rsquo;s Tartan Day&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes moves by several  Scottish local authorities, led by Angus Council, to seek ways of promoting  Tartan Day as a national event in Scotland; commends Perth and Kinross, Dundee,  Stirling and Edinburgh City councils who already help to make Scotland the  focus of Tartan Day; notes that Tartan Day, celebrated on the anniversary of  the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath, has been the subject of large-scale  celebrations in America and elsewhere, and urges the Scottish Executive to  provide more assistance to facilitate a national celebration of Tartan Day in  Scotland to encourage Americans and others of Scottish descent to come to  Scotland to celebrate the event, which will bring economic and cultural  benefits to Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3839 Mr Andrew Welsh: Community  and Village Halls&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern the increased  costs of water charges paid by new village and community halls and that these  will also be imposed on older halls after 2010; recognises that these halls  play a vital role as the hub of the community by providing a venue for  educational classes, Scottish dancing, recreation, Scottish Women&rsquo;s Rural Institute  meetings, keep-fit classes, youth clubs, scouts, brownies and other activities;  believes that these charges to charitable organisations are an undue burden on  local rural communities in Angus; notes that the Scottish Executive has partly  funded numerous new halls and refurbishments for many more which has caused an  increase in the rateable value burden, and calls on the Executive to extend the  exemption scheme to all community and village halls with charitable status and  to introduce legislation to reinstate the exemption for community and village  halls which have charitable status.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3838 Bill Aitken on behalf of the Edinburgh  Tram (Line Two) Bill Committee: Edinburgh Tram (Line Two) Bill&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament agrees that the Edinburgh Tram (Line Two) Bill be passed.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3837.1 Murdo Fraser: Air  Route Development Fund&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3837) in the name of  Tavish Scott, insert at end &ldquo;notes, however, that the ARDF represents a  comparatively modest contribution to the massive expansion of air services over  recent decades, which is chiefly due to the substantial deregulation of the  industry achieved by the liberalising policies of the last Conservative  administration, such as the privatisation of the British Airports Authority  (BAA), the privatisation of British Airways (BA), the Airports Act 1986, the  Civil Aviation Act 1980 and the pursuit of a European single market in  aviation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3837.2 Fergus Ewing: Air  Route Development Fund&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3837) in the name of  Tavish Scott, insert at end &ldquo;further acknowledges the importance of aviation in  the prime aim of growing the Scottish economy; urges the Executive to seek to  remove barriers to further success in aviation policy; calls on the Executive  to audit and review the ARDF and its efficacy thus far, with a view to refining  and widening its terms, and to consider, for example, its extension to air  freight traffic and to less frequent and seasonal services, and urges the Executive  to work with Scotland&rsquo;s airports and carriers to deliver a competitive economic  environment, which should include the provision of appropriate and sufficient  infrastructure for our airports.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3837.3 Mr Mark Ruskell: Air  Route Development Fund&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3837) in the name of  Tavish Scott, leave out from &ldquo;endorses&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;questions the  success of the Air Route Development Fund (ARDF) in bringing sustainable  development benefits to Scotland; further questions whether economic advantages  have flowed to the Scottish economy from the ARDF; supports the development of  an international regime that reduces overall aviation emissions; notes that  promoting expansion of aviation undermines existing emissions targets and that  projected growth in aviation would necessitate cessation of economic activity  in other sectors in order to achieve targets; notes that the net cost of  aviation to the Scottish economy was &pound;1.4 billion in 2004 and that the United  Kingdom accounts for 87% of tourist visits to Scotland; supports work to  improve rail journey times between Scotland and London in order to reduce the  reliance on domestic short-haul flights but notes the lack of progress in this  respect, and condemns the further use of public funds for the ARDF.&rdquo;</p>
