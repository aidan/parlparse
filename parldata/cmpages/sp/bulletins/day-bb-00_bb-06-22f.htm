    <p ALIGN="left"><font FACE="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1044</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Scottish Criminal
    Records Office Checks on Voluntary Organisations</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the
    previously stated intention of the Scottish Executive to make Scottish Criminal Records
    Office checks mandatory for those working with children in Scotland and that there is now
    to be a delay in implementation; welcomes the introduction of the checks, but notes that
    the charges for these checks will place a weighty burden upon voluntary organisations;
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to take the opportunity afforded by the delay in the
    implementation of the scheme to examine possible avenues for exempting voluntary
    organisations from those charges, and asks that the current working party also considers
    this.</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-1043</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Steeplejacks</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament pays tribute to the skills of the nation&#146;s steeplejacks who maintain our
    monuments, churches and major buildings and undertake work which makes them &quot;heroes
    on high&quot; and, in particular, pays tribute to Mr Mick Hatton, who lost his life while
    working at Edinburgh Castle and sends its tribute and respects to Mr Hatton&#146;s family
    at their time of sorrow. </p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-1042</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Breast Feeding and Returning to Work</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive on its adoption of the Scottish
    Breastfeeding Group (SBG) code of practice on breastfeeding and returning to work and
    urges all employers in Scotland to adopt the code and the SBG recommendations on its
    implementation.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-1041</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Forgotten Children Campaign</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament supports the &quot;Forgotten Children Campaign&quot; launched by Save the
    Children to draw attention to the suffering of the 20 million children who have been
    forced from their homes by war and urges all MSPs to donate photographs as a contribution
    to the campaign&#146;s &quot;Portrait Pledge Photographs&quot; initiative.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-1040#</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Food Safety</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament congratulates the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) in surveying the views
    of consumers regarding food quality and food safety; notes that this survey revealed
    consumer concerns regarding intensive farming methods, pesticide contamination, food
    advertising directed at children, the use of sewage as a fertiliser, the use of animal
    by-products in animal feed, the excessive use of artificial colourings and flavourings and
    the exploitation of Third World farmers by multi-national food companies; further notes
    that the CWS is now conducting further inquiries to identify how consumers concerns on
    food safety can be addressed, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to work with the CWS
    in identifying initiatives to address the concerns of Scottish consumers in relation to
    food safety.<strong><i> R</i></strong></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-1039</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Moratorium on GM Crop Farm Scale Trials</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with concern the importation of GM contaminated seed; regrets the
    Scottish Executive&#146;s decision to proceed with the GM crop trial despite substantial
    concerns; has no confidence in the farm scale trial currently underway at Daviot, and
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to abandon the trial and introduce immediately a
    moratorium on further farm scale trials. </p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-1038</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Threatened Closure of Royal Ordnance
    Bishopton</strong>&#151;That the Parliament warmly commends the shop stewards at the Royal
    Ordinance Factory Bishopton and their trade unions for their wholly admirable and
    substantial campaign to maintain the manufacture of military propellants and related
    products at the plant; firmly believes that, even at this late date, BAE Systems should
    have the courage to rescind its earlier and unwise decision to close the plant, and
    further believes that such a change of heart would make good sense because it would allow
    for the retention of the last propellant manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom.</p>

    &quot;recognises concern about the impact of fuel prices especially in rural, highland and
    islands areas where public transport alternatives are more difficult to provide;
    recognises that fuel duty is a reserved matter; welcomes the investigation by the
    Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee into the bulk purchase of fuel for remote
    areas; welcomes the progress made by the Scottish Executive in implementing a
    comprehensive integrated transport strategy and investing in public transport projects
    across Scotland; in particular notes support for rural public transport services and the
    network for petrol stations in rural Scotland, as well as measures to sustain lifeline air
    and ferry links, including the Highlands and Islands; and further notes that the current
    budget for the fuel duty rebate would have no impact on Treasury receipts but would be a
    cost to the current budget for Scottish public services.</a></p>
