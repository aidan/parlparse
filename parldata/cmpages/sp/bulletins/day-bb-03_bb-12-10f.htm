          <p> <strong>*S2M-719</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>VIP 
            Radio</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of VIP 
            Radio, the first radio station aimed at breaking down social isolation 
            faced by people with sight problems, which in the first instance will 
            help 10,000 people with sight problems in the Greater Glasgow area; 
            congratulates the station on employing a mix of sighted, blind and 
            partially sighted people; welcomes the potential for this radio station, 
            although initially broadcasting via an internet channel, to extend 
            the service, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to support 
            all public service organisations to ensure that their services and 
            information are fully accessible to people with sight problems and 
            other disabilities.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-718</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Reform 
            of Public Services</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the increased 
            levels of spending on our public services, but notes that this has 
            not been reflected in improved standards of service; recognises that 
            fundamental reform is needed of public services in Scotland to achieve 
            the standards of many other European countries and provide value for 
            money for our taxpayers; calls, therefore, on the Scottish Executive 
            to give patients genuine choice over the treatment they receive, establish 
            foundation hospitals within the NHS in Scotland and promote the development 
            of, and partnership with, the independent sector; calls on the Executive 
            to expand choice and diversity in education by enabling taxpayers' 
            money to follow children to the schools of their parents' choice and 
            develop a network of state-funded but independently managed schools, 
            and further calls on the Executive to enhance local accountability 
            in respect of the provision of police services by the direct election 
            of conveners of police boards.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-717</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Approval 
            of SSI</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that The Food Protection 
            (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) 
            (No.11) (Scotland) Order 2003 (SSI 2003/561) be approved.</P>

            Committee, Stage 2 of the 2004-05 Budget Process</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes the 4th Report 2003 (Session 2) of the Finance Committee, 
            <em>Stage 2 of the 2004-05 Budget Process </em>(SP Paper 62).</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-715.1</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> 
            <strong>Fisheries 2004</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-715) 
            in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from second &quot;that&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;in contrast to last year's negotiations which 
            saw draconian cutbacks in white fish quotas with accompanying hardship 
            for our coastal communities and urges the Executive to support the 
            view of the vast majority of Scottish fishermen that it is time to 
            end the discredited Common Fisheries Policy and to regain national 
            control of UK waters.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-715.2</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Fisheries 
            2004</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-715) in the name of Ross 
            Finnie, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to implement an immediate ban on industrial 
            fishing and to reinstate the full fishing rights for our deep water 
            fleet; calls for national control of our fishing grounds and local 
            management of our fisheries, the recognition and protection of the 
            Scottish catch as a quality product, a review of the science of fish 
            management and an immediate investigation into the possible establishment 
            of a &quot;haddock box&quot; and closed areas of cod &quot;hot spots&quot;, 
            and calls on the Executive to fight for an immediate review of the 
            concordat between Her Majesty's Government and the Executive on fisheries 
            and the return of the fishing boundary to the line of Berwick-upon-Tweed.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-715.3</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Fisheries 
            2004</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-715) in the name of Ross 
            Finnie, insert at end &quot;; believes that effort controls need to 
            include limits to the total fishing capacity of the fleet, the establishment 
            of regeneration areas, tighter controls over industrial fisheries 
            and the widespread adoption of independent observers at sea and in 
            ports as part of a European Union-wide recovery plan, and further 
            believes that annual bartering is a fundamentally inappropriate approach 
            to the sustainable management of fisheries and that multi-annual management 
            planning is essential.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-715.4</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Fisheries 
            2004</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-715) in the name of Ross 
            Finnie, insert at end &quot;but believes that the Common Fisheries 
            Policy has failed and that it is in the interests of our fishing communities 
            and fisheries conservation that fishing policy is repatriated to Scotland.&quot;</P>
