<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7697 Stewart Maxwell: Holocaust Memorial Day 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, on Thursday 27 January 2011, communities across Scotland will mark Holocaust Memorial Day; notes that this will be the 66th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration and death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, the site of one of the largest mass murders in human history, where over one million men, women and children were killed; further notes that the theme of Holocaust Memorial Day 2011 is Untold Stories; congratulates the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust for its work in supporting events across the country to mark the day; values the Holocaust Educational Trust&rsquo;s Lessons from Auschwitz Project, which gives two post-16-year-old students from every school and college in Scotland the chance to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau; applauds James Clements and Mimi Evans-Agnew, two students from Hyndland Secondary School in Glasgow, on delivering the Parliament&rsquo;s Time for Reflection message based on their experiences of the project; commends what it sees as the great contribution to Scotland by Holocaust survivors, and encourages all members to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day and to commit to ensuring that racism and prejudice are never again allowed to gain a foothold in society.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7696&diams;   Brian Adam: Fuel Tax Price Increase Double Whammy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that fuel prices throughout Scotland have increased again due to the rise in VAT to 20% and an increase in fuel duty by the UK Government in January adding 0.76p to the price of a litre of petrol and diesel making diesel prices the second highest in Europe; notes that 62% of the cost of an average litre of diesel is tax as opposed to a European average of 49%; notes that in Aberdeen, despite its being known as Europe&rsquo;s oil capital, petrol and diesel prices in January were again over 130p per litre, which has increased costs for small businesses and the road haulage industry, which it considers have been forced to pass increases on to customers, contributing to rising inflation, and believes that cutting the cost of fuel by 10p per litre in Scotland would cost only about half of the estimated &pound;1 billion in extra revenue that the Treasury is set to take in as a result of rising oil prices.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7695 Jamie Hepburn: Cuts to First Bus Services across Central Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by First Bus to implement, from 16 January 2011, what are believed to be significant cuts to bus services across central Scotland; further notes that, as part of the scheduled changes, a number of services are to be withdrawn, including the X2 Glasgow-Cumbernauld route, and that other services, including the 36 and 36A Glasgow-Chryston/Abronhill route, are to operate on a reduced frequency; considers that these changes will significantly limit the travel options of bus users across central Scotland, and calls on First Bus to reconsider these service cuts.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7694 Mary Scanlon: Save RAF Lossiemouth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises what it considers as the huge support for <em>The Northern Scot&rsquo;s</em> petition to save RAF Lossiemouth, which has been signed by over 30,000 people; recognises that this represents over one third of the total population of Moray; applauds the decision of campaigners to travel from Moray to Downing Street in a battle bus to deliver the petition in person; believes that the undertaking of a 1,200-mile round trip shows the strength of feeling in the local community to save the RAF base, and hopes what it sees as this tremendous campaign will resound with decision makers and secure the future of RAF Lossiemouth.</p>
