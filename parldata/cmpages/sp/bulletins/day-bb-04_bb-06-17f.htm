          <p><strong>*S2M-1492</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Possible 
            Closure of the Adventure Centre, Ratho</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            believes that the Adventure Centre at Ratho Quarry, near Edinburgh, 
            which is the biggest indoor rock-climbing centre in the world and 
            offers a wide range of activities to schools, groups and individuals 
            at all levels of ability, is a vital element in promoting health, 
            activity, tourism and good safety practices in Scotland; is most concerned 
            at the possibility that the Bank of Scotland may force it to close 
            down, and urges the Bank of Scotland, taking account of its policies 
            of promoting good sporting, youth and community activities, to agree 
            arrangements proposed by supporters of the centre that will enable 
            it to continue to operate and build up its activities and, by greater 
            activity, better management and rescheduling, gradually repay its

          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1490</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>The 
            Education Maintenance Allowances (Scotland) Regulations 2004</strong>&#8212;That 
            the Enterprise and Culture Committee recommends that nothing further 
            be done under the Education Maintenance Allowances (Scotland) Regulations 
            2004 (SSI 2004/273).</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1489</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Sir 
            Patrick Geddes</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes the increasing 
            importance of the work and philosophy of the Scottish polymath, Sir 
            Patrick Geddes, who was born in Ballater on 2 October 1854; recognises 
            that Geddes was a botanist, environmentalist, educator, planner, conservationist, 
            internationalist and patron of the arts; notes that he combined all 
            these aspects in his designs for reviving the High Street in Edinburgh, 
            for the Armenian community in Cyprus, for the University in Jerusalem, 
            for various cities in India and for the Scots College in Montpellier; 
            further notes that he foresaw the dangers of forest clearance as a 
            cause of drought, and welcomes the fact that the Ballater Geddes Project 
            2004 has adopted the quotation &quot;By Leaves We Live&quot; as its 
            motto for the exhibition they are planning from 7 August to 2 October 
            2004.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1488</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Liverpool&#8217;s 
            Princess</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament calls on Her Majesty&#8217;s 
            Government to intervene immediately to stop the removal and deportation 
            of Jugder and Shinee Narantsogt and their two children, Evsaana, aged 
            17, and Misheel, aged eight; also fears for the safety of Jugder, 
            who was a provincial leader of the Mongolian Democratic Party and 
            was arrested and then forced into hiding by the ruling party in Mongolia; 
            furthermore calls on members of the Westminster Parliament to intervene 
            on the family&#8217;s behalf in order to enable Aamer Anwar, the family&#8217;s 
            lawyer in Scotland, to have access to their casework to ensure that 
            they have been properly and fully represented; regrets that little 
            Misheel, who was selected from hundreds of children in Liverpool to 
            be crowned Liverpool&#8217;s Parade Princess on 10 July 2004, will 
            now be unable to attend the parade due to detention and removal arrangements, 
            and finally condemns the current system which treats people with such 
            cold and heartless brutality and demands the immediate closure of 
            Dungavel House, which stands on Scottish soil but lies outside the 
            powers of the Parliament, making it Scotland&#8217;s very own Guantanamo 
            Bay.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1487</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Internet 
            Dialler Fraud</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament acknowledges the 
            public harm caused by consumer fraud involving premium rate, satellite 
            and international number internet &quot;diallers&quot;, which close 
            the user&#8217;s current internet connection to their regular service 
            provider and connect to an alternate service without their knowledge; 
            notes that calls to the telephone regulator, Ofcom, have nearly quadrupled 
            during the period 1999-2003, whilst calls to premium-rate regulator, 
            the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone 
            Information Services (ICSTIS) have risen by 500% since the discovery 
            of the internet problem; notes that ICSTIS estimates that the value 
            of premium-rated services in the United Kingdom to be worth over &#163;1 
            billion per year; urges ICSTIS, telecommunication companies and the 
            Internet Service Providers Association to take effective steps to 
            identify the perpetrators and to warn the public of the problem, and 
            believes that Her Majesty&#8217;s Government should introduce legislation 
            to protect consumers against such fraud, which is estimated to cost 
            consumers around &#163;5 to &#163;10 million a year on premium-rate 
            internet calls alone.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1486</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to the British Pipe Band Championships Held at Turriff</strong>&#8212;That 
            the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the British Pipe Band 
            Championships held in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, on Saturday 12 June 
            2004 for arranging a spectacular day&#8217;s entertainment involving 
            in excess of 3,000 pipers, drummers and highland dancers; further 
            congratulates, not only the winners, but all performers for giving 
            their best in front of an audience of 20,000 people and welcomes the 
            huge economic benefit that the championships have brought to businesses 
            in Aberdeenshire, and hopes that the championships will return to 
            Turriff in the near future.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1485</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Cutting 
            Class Sizes</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes the motion passed 
            at the Educational Institute of Scotland&#8217;s (EIS) Annual General 
            Meeting on 12 June 2004 calling on the EIS National Council to enter 
            into urgent negotiations with employers to cut class sizes to 20 and 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to support EIS policy on class sizes.</p>
