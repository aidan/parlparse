    Parliament notes the establishment of the first paid development worker within the field
    of dyspraxia in the UK, to be based in the Highlands and Islands; notes that the condition
    is estimated to affect up to ten per cent of the population; recognises that dyspraxia is
    often overlooked by GPs and is unknown to many in the teaching profession, and believes
    that greater recognition should be given to the condition by education and health
    professionals and that dyspraxia should be included in the current regime of pre-school
    screening.</p>
