          <p><strong>*S1M-3150</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: The Modernising 
            Government Fund</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the Scottish 
            Executive&#146;s commitment to modern, high quality, efficient and 
            responsive public services and supports its approach, through the 
            Modernising Government Fund, to help deliver the changes which will 
            integrate government, exploit the benefits of information and communications 
            technology and put citizens at the centre of public service delivery 
            in a 21st Century Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3149</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Alternatives 
            to Custody</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the Scottish 
            Executive&#146;s commitment to developing a range of high quality 
            alternatives to custody which fit the changing pattern of offending 
            behaviour across Scotland, and recognises the importance of ensuring 
            the delivery of consistently effective community disposals which have 
            the confidence of the judiciary and the public and also have the potential 
            to reduce re-offending without compromising public safety.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3148</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Water Charges 
            Soaking up Small Borders Businesses</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that for a small business in the Scottish Borders with a rateable 
            value in the order of £20,000-£25,000 per annum the water bill will 
            be some £593.60 as compared to £383.89 for a similar business in Berwick; 
            notes that a substantial increase in charges to small Borders businesses 
            is directly attributable to the 179.1% increase from last year in 
            the daily charge, the 45% increase in the sewerage daily charge and 
            the 71.4% increase in the surface water drainage charge; notes that, 
            additionally, the surface water drainage charge impacts disproportionately 
            on small businesses comprising as it does some 50% of the total billing 
            so that small local Borders businesses, such as post offices, newsagents, 
            other retailers and manufacturing companies and offices employing 
            50 or less, which are still reeling from foot-and-mouth and the consequential 
            downturn in tourism, are further burdened by punitive water charges; 
            considers that the historic method of calculating commercially metered 
            water rates requires radical overhaul, and therefore calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to review the entire system of charging commercially 
            metered water without delay.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3147</strong> <strong>John Scott: Suez Medal</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament acknowledges the contribution made by British Servicemen 
            during the Suez emergency from 1951 to 1954, notes with concern that, 
            despite many representations over the years, no award has been made 
            of a &quot;Suez Medal&quot; for those who served at that time, and 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government to invite the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations 
            and Medals to ensure that due recognition is given to this group of 
            servicemen, many of whom served in Scottish regiments.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3146 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Approval of SSIs</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees 
            that the following instruments be approved&#151;</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3145#</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe: Legislation for 
            Increased Penalties for Wildlife Crime</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            recognises that, while a dedicated, all-encompassing, natural heritage 
            Bill based on the proposals in <em>The Nature of Scotland</em> consultation 
            document would be the preferred option, recent incidents such as the 
            poisoning of a sea eagle and a golden eagle in Ayrshire, poisoning 
            of a golden eagle in Aberdeenshire and the theft of two full clutches 
            of osprey eggs in Perthshire, demonstrate the increasing urgency of 
            delivering legislation that brings the level of sanctions against 
            wildlife criminals into line with those available in England and Wales 
            within this session of the Parliament and before next year's breeding 
            season, and considers that the Executive should (a) progress legislation 
            on wildlife crime through amendments to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) 
            Bill and (b) reiterate its firm commitment to, and give a timetable 
            for, a Bill to enact the remaining proposals in <em>The Nature of Scotland.</em></p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3144</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Glasgow Housing 
            Association and European Commission Rules</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            expresses its concern that the transfer of Glasgow council housing 
            to the Glasgow Housing Association may breach European Commission 
            rules on state aid; notes the inadequate answers given so far on this 
            matter by the Scottish Executive, and calls for an early ministerial 
            statement on the issue.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3143#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: Promoting Scotland's 
            Industrial Heritage</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that 
            our industrial heritage is of interest to many people from other countries 
            as well as Scots, and believes that the Scottish Executive should 
            look at ways to market ex-industrial areas throughout Scotland such 
            as Coatbridge and give consideration to exploring the idea of state-run 
            hotels, along the line of Spanish paradors, where listed buildings 
            could be restored to provide accommodation for tourists thus allowing 
            itineraries to include non-traditional tourist facilities such as 
            Summerlee Heritage Park in Coatbridge which is home to the only working 
            trams in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3142</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Conservative Support 
            for Creationist Schools</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            astonishment the remarks made by Mr Murdo Fraser MSP, the Deputy Education 
            Spokesperson for the Tory Party in Scotland, on BBC Scotland Television 
            on 17 May 2002, in which he expressed support for groups promoting 
            &quot;creationist&quot; views on science running state schools in 
            Scotland; notes that members of such groups totally reject evolution 
            and have nothing to do with the great religious faiths in Scotland 
            and the wider world; further notes that creationists have taken control 
            of a state-funded secondary school in Gateshead, where they are undermining 
            the teaching of science; rejects the foolish position of the Tory 
            Party in Scotland, which seems now to be not only against devolution 
            but also evolution, and asserts that misguided creationist groups 
            should not be placed in charge of children&#146;s education in Scotland.

          <p><strong>S1M-3142.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Conservative Support 
            for Creationist Schools</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3142) 
            in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from &quot;astonishment&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;disappointment the hypocrisy of the Scottish 
            National Party, which one week proclaimed itself the champion of choice 
            and diversity in education and the next condemns any educators with 
            whom they disagree; derides Michael Russell&#146;s assumption that 
            creationist views have nothing to do with the great religious faiths 
            in Scotland and the wider world when there are different views among 
            Christians in many mainstream denominations on the question of creation 
            and evolution; notes that, under Conservative proposals, any state-funded 
            school in Scotland would be required to teach the curriculum and be 
            subject to inspections by Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Education; 
            warmly welcomes the findings of the poll commissioned by the Catholic 
            Church in Scotland which showed that the majority of Scots support 
            the right of Catholic parents to send their children to Catholic schools 
            and that the overwhelming majority of Scots believe that moral values 
            should be taught in schools; recognises the importance of diversity 
            in Scottish education, and believes that the best way to deliver this 
            is through greater parental choice.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3141</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Larkhall to Milngavie 
            Rail Line</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the comments of 
            South Lanarkshire councillor David McLachlan, vice-convener of Strathclyde 
            Passenger Transport (SPT), in relation to the Larkhall to Milngavie 
            rail line that &quot;all we need is the Parliament to give us the 
            power to head up the project&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to make a decision over whether the British Railways (No.3) Order 
            Confirmation Act 1994 can be transferred to SPT or whether a new Bill 
            needs to be introduced into the Parliament to allow for this link, 
            which is vital to the future economic prosperity of Larkhall, Stonehouse 
            and Leshmahagow, to be progressed.</p>

            Rose junior football club on winning the Scottish Junior Cup for the 
            first time since 1965; acknowledges the hard work of the players,

            the vast amount of work involved in staging such a prestigious event;

            who contributed to the creation and building of the Falkirk Millennium 
            Wheel, which is a testament to Scotland&#146;s well-renowned and innovative

            Development Scotland to encourage people to be volunteers during this 
            year&#146;s Volunteers Week from 7 to 13 June 2002; congratulates 
            and welcomes those who will be volunteering for the first time during 
            that week; appreciates that very many of those volunteering will already 
            be regular and committed volunteers who support individuals and communities 
            in many indispensable ways, and commends the valuable contribution

          <p><strong>S1M-3134</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson: Transfers Under 
            PFI/PPP - Protection of Staff Rights and Conditions</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises concerns expressed by many employees, trade 
            union members, commentators and concerned citizens about the operation 
            of PFI/PPP contracts initiated by the public sector in Scotland; acknowledges 
            that these concerns are based on a number of factors, including the 
            excessive cost of capital provided, the quality of public service 
            provided and the rights and conditions of staff employed under PFI/PPP 
            contracts; further recognises that many of the alleged efficiency 
            gains in PFI/PPP contracts in comparison to the public sector are 
            made at the expense of staff rights and conditions, which, in turn, 
            can have a significant negative impact on the quality of ongoing service; 
            further recognises that there is growing concern that the rights and 
            conditions of employees transferred out of the public sector in Scotland 
            through PFI/PPP deals are less favourably protected than elsewhere 
            in the UK; resolves that any future PFI/PPP contracts should make 
            the detail of alleged efficiency savings publicly available and specify 
            the impact that such savings have on staff rights and conditions so 
            that public bodies entering into such agreements are fully accountable 
            to the people that they serve, and further resolves that, in respect 
            of employee transfers under the TUPE regulations from public bodies 
            for which the Scottish Executive has any responsibility, transfer 
            practice should adhere to the Cabinet Office Statement of Practice 
            as a minimum standard.</p>

            at end &quot;while noting that the absence of a bypass for Aberdeen

          <p><strong>S1M-3051#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Drug Misuse 
            in North East Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            concern that drug misuse in the north east of Scotland has increased 
            dramatically in recent years, with an estimated 50% rise in problem 
            drug users in Grampian alone between 1997 and 2000; further notes 
            that Dundee has the second highest and Aberdeen the third highest 
            level of drug misuse in Scotland and that Grampian has the highest 
            percentage of injecting drug users in Scotland, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should recognise the scale of the problem and 
            investigate the level and nature of resources that have been applied 
            to addressing this growing social problem in the north east region, 
            paying particular attention to (a) the role and accountability of 
            the various agencies involved, (b) the amount of resources dedicated 
            to drug users, (c) the cost to society in terms of loss of life, associated 
            health problems and distress caused to users' families and (d) the 
            enormous amount of drug-related crime inflicted on the local community, 
            reflected by the fact that 80% of inmates at HM Prison Aberdeen test 
            positive for drug use at reception.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2953#</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Timber Industry</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">acknowledges the value of timber 
            as a primary product within rural Scotland and the 11,000 jobs which 
            are dependent on that industry; recognises the very real difficulties 
            faced by some rural local authorities in maintaining and improving 
            minor roads for timber extraction, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should meet COSLA&#146;s Rural Affairs Committee and representatives 
            of the forestry industry to determine a satisfactory way forward, 
            recognising that the placing of weight restriction orders, which effectively 
            landlock large areas of mature timber, is not a realistic solution.</a><strong><em>
