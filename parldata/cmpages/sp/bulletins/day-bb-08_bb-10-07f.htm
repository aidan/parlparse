<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2671</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Scottish Broadcasting Commission</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Broadcasting Commission&rsquo;s final report and recognises the cross-party engagement that enabled the commission to carry out its work in a constructive and consensual fashion; notes that the report reflects the importance of broadcasting to the cultural and economic life of Scotland and accepts that the Parliament should take an active role in considering the broadcasting industry and services as they relate to Scotland; welcomes the key recommendation for the creation of a new public service Scottish digital network, which represents a major opportunity to develop Scotland&rsquo;s broadcasting industry; notes that the commission&rsquo;s recommendations require action by a range of parties, and calls on the Scottish Government to respond positively to the report within its responsibilities.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford*</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2670</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Leading on Nurseries and Childcare</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s recent announcement that over the next five years it is planning to give every parent in Glasgow with pre-school children access to year-round nursery provision within buggy pushing distance of their homes; notes that, as a result of these wide-ranging proposals, Glasgow parents will also enjoy the most comprehensive and flexible service for five to 14-year-olds anywhere in the United Kingdom, ultimately benefiting from an affordable childcare scheme that will provide access to sport, music and play from 8 am until 6 pm in a range of school and community venues; further notes that the initial five pilot schemes that are due to begin in November 2008 will encourage Glasgow parents to access their full tax credit entitlements and will include information for parents about possible employment opportunities while prioritising placements for parents wishing to return to education, training or work and offering reduced costs linked to the UK Government&rsquo;s tax credit banding for parents on low incomes, in training or with larger families, and believes that the council&rsquo;s far reaching and progressive proposals represent a major step forward in tackling child poverty and parental worklessness in the city.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2669</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Captain&rsquo;s Galley Lands Another Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates chef Jim Cowie and his wife, Mary, on the latest success of the Captain&rsquo;s Galley restaurant in Scrabster harbour; notes that its recent award of Taste of Highlands and Islands Restaurant of the Year at the Highlands and Islands Food and Drink Awards follows on from being the only Scottish restaurant to be named in the top ten of the <em>Which?</em> <em>Good Food Guide</em> <em>2009 </em>editor&rsquo;s choice, as well as a host of awards in recent years; commends the seafood restaurant&rsquo;s ethical food policy, which means that, whenever possible, the restaurant uses fresh local ingredients sourced within a 50-mile radius of the restaurant, uses only seafood that is in season and purchases non-pressured stocks, which are taken from sustainable areas of the seas, thus benefiting the local economy and environment as well as the population&rsquo;s palates, and wishes all those connected with the restaurant continued success for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2668&diams; </strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>School Meals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the need to examine the current school meals crisis in Edinburgh and across the country as a result of severely cash-strapped local authorities; questions the SNP government&rsquo;s success in fulfilling its ambitions, set out in the historic concordat and single outcome agreements, to tackle childhood obesity and promote healthy eating at a time when school kitchens are closing and hot healthy school meals are being replaced with imported, pre-packed, often processed food; feels that these actions undermine the good reputation that the Parliament has achieved in securing free healthy school meals and promoting healthy living through initiatives like Hungry for Success, and further recognises the need to give every child the best possible start in life.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2667</strong> <strong>Duncan McNeil on behalf of the Local Government and Communities Committee:</strong> <strong>Report on Elections 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Local Government and Communities Committee&rsquo;s 8th Report, 2008 (Session 3): <em>Elections 2007 </em>(SP Paper 120).</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2660*#*</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Growing Old Together - Older People and Debt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of<em> Growing Old Together - Older People and Debt</em> by Citizens Advice Scotland; is concerned that the average debt level for older people seeking advice from their local citizens advice bureau is &pound;17,767, a 25% increase since 2003; further notes the finding that levels of debt increased as levels of income decreased, with clients in the survey who had a net income of less than &pound;6,000 having debt levels on average 42% higher than those with an income higher than &pound;10,000; recognises the excellent work of citizens advice bureaux in Glasgow and across Scotland in advising older debt clients; supports the need for early and effective benefits take up and debt advice to be available for all older people, and considers that measures to deal with debt, such as debt arrangement schemes and the low income low asset regulations, should be accessible and beneficial for older clients.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2659</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Working Together on Child Poverty and the Minimum Wage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its disappointment that Labour MSP Mary Mulligan should engage in party politics on the issue of child poverty by laying down her amendment, S3M-2621.1, to motion S3M-2621 (Ending the Shame of Child Poverty); condemns the amendment on the basis that it seeks to break the unity that exists across a broad spectrum of political parties on the important issue of the national minimum wage by implying that this important development in the fight against poverty was not supported by SNP MPs; notes that SNP MPs voted in favour of the national minimum wage more often than Tony Blair and as often as Gordon Brown MP but would not use this information to imply a lack of commitment to the national minimum wage from either of the aforementioned MPs; acknowledges that SNP MPs not only supported the Bill but took part in the committee that oversaw its progress; looks forward to the continuation of a cross-party approach to tackling child poverty, and hopes that Mary Mulligan MSP will once again be part of that cross-party approach.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2659.1</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Working Together on Child Poverty and the Minimum Wage</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2659) in the name of Bob Doris, leave out from &quot;Labour MSP Mary Mulligan&quot; to end and insert &quot;when the Conservative Party used filibustering in an attempt to talk out the National Minimum Wage Bill during its crucial final stage in the House of Commons, not one SNP MP stayed to vote to help ensure its passage or even register support despite the party&rsquo;s rhetoric before and since on this issue; considers that the personalised criticism that the intention in submitting amendment S3M-2621.1 was to seek to &quot;engage in party politics on the issue of child poverty&quot; and break unity on the issue of the national minimum wage to be laughable, given not only the partisan and self-congratulatory motion which it alters, but also the tone, tenor and standard of SNP motions in this Parliament more generally, including on the subject of child poverty and the national minimum wage.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2653*#*</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Fare Deal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the 12 charities which, on UK Older People&rsquo;s Day, 1 October 2008, launched a Fare Deal campaign for the concessionary travel scheme to be extended to cover special transport schemes used by elderly and disabled people, such as Dial-a-Journey in Forth Valley; considers that thousands of people who have or are entitled to a free bus pass are missing out because they cannot use regular scheduled services, and believes that an extension to the national concessionary travel scheme to include demand-responsive community transport should be considered.</p>
