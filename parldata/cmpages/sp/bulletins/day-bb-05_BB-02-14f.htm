         <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p align="center">  <strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2428 Mrs Nanette Milne:Congratulations to Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament sends its congratulations to Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay, and Camilla Parker Bowles on the news of their recent engagement; hopes that the couple will enjoy many years of happiness together; is delighted that the couple have chosen to honeymoon in the beautiful north east of Scotland, and believes that the vast majority of people in Scotland will wish them well in this important step forward.</p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2427 Mrs Mary Mulligan:Congratulations to Home Aid, Bathgate&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates Home Aid in Bathgate, West Lothian, on its contribution to furniture recycling; notes that redistribution of furniture helps both the environment and those who find it difficult to furnish their homes, and congratulates Home Aid on its innovative partnership with Oregon in the United States of America for recycling furniture beyond Scotland.</p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2426# Mr Brian Monteith:Resources to Police Boards&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises the vital role that the police play within Scottish communities; believes that it is vital that Scotland&rsquo;s police forces are adequately resourced to ensure maximum protection to the public; acknowledges that Scottish police boards have very little time to brief and consult constituent local authorities before finalising the budget for their police force area; agrees that it is vital that figures provided by the Scottish Executive with regard to local authority grants are as accurate as possible to aid this process; therefore notes with concern that there were errors in the detail of local authority funding announced by the Executive on 8 December 2004 which have resulted in uncertainty facing many police boards across Scotland with regard to grant support for police loan charges and common police services; is concerned that some local authorities have had to source additional funding, such as Scottish Borders which has had to find an additional &pound;650,000 from its already-agreed budget allocations, and therefore considers that the Executive should engage urgently with our police boards to resolve any problems and to ensure that such mistakes are not repeated in the future.</p>
