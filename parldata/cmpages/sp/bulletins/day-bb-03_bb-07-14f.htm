          <p><strong>*S2M-227</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>National 
            Health Service Reform (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>-That 
            the Parliament, for the purposes of any act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the National Health Service Reform (Scotland) Bill, 
            agrees to any increase in expenditure of the Scottish Ministers payable 
            out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the act.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-226#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Maternity 
            Services in Argyll and Clyde NHS Board Area</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes with dismay the decision of the NHS Argyll and Clyde Maternity 
            Services Steering Group to recommend that all in-patient consultant-led 
            maternity services in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area be centralised 
            at the Royal Alexandria Hospital, Paisley; further notes that this 
            decision will force over 200,000 women over a 2,880 square mile area 
            to travel to a single hospital for in-patient consultant-led services; 
            expresses concern that this decision could concentrate maternity services 
            for up to quarter of the Scottish female population in two hospitals 
            that are seven miles apart; is disappointed that the consultation 
            process, despite representations, was substantially curtailed; looks 
            forward to legislative changes that would prevent situations such 
            as this recurring, and urges NHS boards, when considering restructuring 
            service delivery, to have regard not only to the clinicians whom they 
            employ but also to the communities that they serve and stop the march 
            towards the centralisation of NHS services.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-225</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Environmentally 
            Sensitive Areas Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the 
            ecological and economic benefits that the Environmentally Sensitive 
            Areas (ESA) scheme has provided and, in order to ensure that these 
            benefits are not jeopardised, recommends that any ESA agreements that 
            are coming to an end before land management contracts are in place 
            be extended until such time as these contracts are in place.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-224</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Vulnerable 
            Witnesses (Scotland) Bill - Financial Resolution</strong>-That the 
            Parliament, for the purposes of any act of the Parliament resulting 
            from the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any increase, 
            in consequence of the act, in expenditure charged on, or payable out 
            of, the Scottish Consolidated Fund.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-223</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Student 
            Support of Democracy in Iran</strong>-That the Parliament expresses 
            its support to students currently demonstrating on behalf of democracy 
            in Iran and applauds the brave stance that they are taking; notes 
            the commemoration of the students in Iran who died or were injured 
            whilst demonstrating four years ago; believes strongly that these 
            students should be welcomed into this country and given a safe and 
            secure home for so long as they wish to stay, and calls for proper 
            resources and aid to be made available to groups aiding asylum seekers.</P>
