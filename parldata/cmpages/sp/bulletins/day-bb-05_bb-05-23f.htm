That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

          <p align="center"><strong> New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2853</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard: Confirmation That Tasers Will Not Be Used at G8</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes recent press reports that police officers at the G8 summit will be equipped with electroshock tasers; notes that tasers are potentially lethal and inherently open to abuse; welcomes the statement from David Strang, President of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland that, &ldquo;Tasers will not be used by either Scottish officers or by officers from England and Wales during the G8&rdquo;, and is concerned that negative and unfounded press reports may dissuade people from exercising their right to peaceful protest.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2852#</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>A Cure for ME?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with pleasure that a scientific team from Glasgow University, headed by Dr John Gow, may have discovered a remedy for myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) which could be available in as little as year; further notes that the university has already patented the genes involved as a means of diagnosing the condition quickly and cheaply; recognises that this could represent a major step forward in the treatment and cure of this debilitating disease but notes with alarm Dr Gow&rsquo;s concern that he is &ldquo;going nowhere&rdquo; because his funding has run out, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take every possible step to ensure that this work can be continued in order that the 10,000 to 20,000 ME sufferers in Scotland can play a full part in the economic and social life of their country.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2851</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Store Wars</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the Somerfield supermarket chain&rsquo;s decision to close its Aberness service centre and depot in Aberdeen, which will lead to the loss of around 75 jobs; calls on Somerfield to do everything possible to find alternative employment for the Aberness workforce, and believes, furthermore, that the current store wars that are taking place throughout Scotland may be considered by some to be good for customers, but are certainly not beneficial to employees who work in the retail trade. </p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2849</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone: Changes to BBC Weather Forecast</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the changes the BBC has made to weather forecast bulletins; further notes that these changes distort Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England on the map, reducing the information available to many viewers, especially across the north of Scotland, with the Northern Isles barely visible at all; recognises that many people depend on reliable weather forecasting to make their living as fishermen, farmers or crofters or to pursue outdoor leisure activities, and therefore calls on the BBC to revise the maps to provide an adequate weather forecast service for the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2848</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: 3rd Anniversary of Timor-Leste&rsquo;s Independence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the world&rsquo;s newest nation, East Timor, on the third anniversary of its independence; notes that the Australian Government has, since East Timor&rsquo;s independence referendum in 1999, taken in approximately $1.2 billion in revenue from oil fields much closer to East Timor than to Australia, and is claiming the bulk of the revenues from the largest known field, Greater Sunrise, on the basis of prior occupation stemming from illegal agreements with Indonesia, the former occupier of East Timor; notes that the Australian Government pre-emptively withdrew from the maritime boundary jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea two months before East Timor&rsquo;s independence, and believes that the Australian Government should now work to establish a fair and permanent maritime boundary with East Timor based on the rule of international legal principles, recognising that the poorest nation in Asia deserves more than shabby revenue deals well short of its legal entitlements. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2846 Margaret Smith: Edinburgh Airport Blueprint Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by BAA of a consultation on the long-term development blueprint for Edinburgh Airport; notes the importance of Edinburgh Airport to the local, regional and national economy, worth &pound;287 million for the Scottish economy and supporting 2,300 jobs directly and 5,000 indirectly; welcomes the improvements being made to the access arrangements with tram, heavy rail and improved roads, but calls on BAA, the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society and the Scottish Executive to investigate the opportunities for co-existence of the Royal Highland Showground and airport, given the society&rsquo;s willingness to give up significant quantities of land, cross-party support for co-existence and the considerable cost of relocation of the showground.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2845 Nora Radcliffe: Wave Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ocean Power Delivery for the signing of the order to build the initial phase of the world&rsquo;s first commercial wave farm; notes that there are 14GW of potential wave energy, as well as 7.5GW of tidal energy, in Scotland&rsquo;s waters; regrets the UK Government&rsquo;s historical antipathy towards marine energy, lasting 20 years and more; regrets that in the last two years the UK Government&rsquo;s energy department has had four energy ministers, Malcolm Wicks, Mike O&rsquo;Brien, Stephen Timms and Brian Wilson and two name changes, from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to the Orwellian Department of Productivity, Energy and Industry and back again; further regrets the admission of the DTI that it will not achieve its 10% renewable energy target by 2010; notes the disparity between the &pound;50 million commitment of the DTI towards marine energy and the &pound;50 billion price bill for managing current levels of radioactive waste; regrets that the DTI appears to want more nuclear power while admitting that questions of finance, government support, market mechanisms, public support and storage of radioactive waste are still unanswered; supports the Scottish Executive in its efforts to promote renewable energy through the Forum for Renewable Energy Development (FREDS), the Marine Energy Test Centre in Orkney, the Renewables Obligation system and the 40% renewables target, and calls on the UK Government to embrace marine energy as a source of carbon-free electricity generation, worth potentially thousands of Scottish jobs and many millions of pounds of Scottish exports. </p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2840 # Dr Jean Turner: Nurse Recruitment and Retention</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that, while some progress has been made in the recruitment of nursing staff in NHSScotland over recent years, the nursing workforce trend in Scotland is of continuing concern with growth at less than half that achieved in England over the period 1997 to 2004; recognises that there is a global nursing shortage and that in the United States of America, which is seeking to recruit an additional one million nurses over the next few years, nurse-patient ratios are increasingly viewed as the best way to both guarantee high standards of patient care and improve staff morale and retention, with the American Nurses&rsquo; Association leading a campaign in Congress for adequate and safe nursing numbers to be guaranteed in law; recognises that in a competitive world market Scotland has to ensure that it is offering the best possible incentives to recruit, retain and reward nurses, and believes that the Scottish Executive should examine options for legally guaranteeing safe nursing numbers in NHSScotland in order to help retain staff and ensure that patients know there will always be enough staff available to give them the standard of care that they require.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2834 Frances Curran: Solidarity with the Erskine Bridge Toll Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Erskine Bridge Toll workers, who are members of the Transport and General Workers Union, on their decision to take official industrial action on Friday 20 May and Saturday 21 May 2005 to prevent the further deterioration of their working conditions and for a &pound;5.50 per hour pay claim; views their pay claim as modest in relation to their employers&rsquo;, APCOA Parking (UK) Ltd, &pound;601,361 income directly from the Scottish Executive merely for collecting tolls; condemns the Executive for allowing APCOA to bring in a security firm to staff the toll booths in an attempt to break the strike, and demands that the Executive use its influence on APCOA to settle the workers&rsquo; claim immediately.</p>

Within a matter of days, there should be an independent assessment of the welfare, educational and developmental needs of each child held in detention to inform decisions about the necessity of continued detention. This should be repeated at regular intervals to advise on the compatibility of detention with the welfare of the child and to inform reviews of detention.&rdquo;; further notes that this is against the background that six children subject to investigation by the reporter to the children&rsquo;s panel were deported before investigations had been concluded, and believes that the Scottish Executive should address the issues of the welfare of children detained in Dungavel as a matter of priority.</p>

          <p> <strong><a name="2770" id="2770"></a>S2M-2770 # Richard Lochhead: Proposed Closure of Rural and Special Needs Schools in Aberdeenshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals by Aberdeenshire Council to close or amalgamate a number of local schools; recognises the strength of feeling amongst parents and the wider community over the implications of closing those schools, as illustrated by the formation of the Garioch Schools Action Group and other local campaigns; notes in particular the proposal to close St Andrew&rsquo;s school in Inverurie, a school that is widely recognised as providing an excellent educational environment for children with special needs; recognises the opposition to the current proposals by local parents at St Andrew&rsquo;s who are genuinely concerned by the impact some of the options proposed by Aberdeenshire Council will have on their children; notes the ongoing confusion over the exact nature of the local authority&rsquo;s proposals which is causing considerable distress amongst parents; believes that Aberdeenshire Council must make available to parents all the necessary information in relation to all those schools proposed for closure as part of the current consultation process; considers that Aberdeenshire Council should recognise the strength of the arguments put forward by parents and the wider community for the retention of their local schools, and further considers that the Scottish Executive should play what role it can to ensure that Aberdeenshire Council&rsquo;s proposals do not damage the educational welfare of the children and wider interests of the community.</p>
