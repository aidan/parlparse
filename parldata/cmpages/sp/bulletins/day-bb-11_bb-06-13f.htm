<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00275 Colin Keir: Opposition to Leith Biomass Plant</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the staunch opposition to the proposed Leith biomass plant among the communities of Leith and across Edinburgh; understands that over 3,100 objections have so far been made on various grounds including noise, visual impact, emissions, air quality, odour and traffic concerns; remains unconvinced that the plant will generate environmental and economic benefits to Edinburgh, with some research suggesting that biomass power may fail to help Scotland meet its short-term CO2 reduction targets; notes the consultation responses by, for example, the Scottish Forestry Commission, Architecture and Design Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and WWF Scotland, highlighting what they consider the numerous shortcomings of the proposals, including the size of the plant, the demolition of a B listed building, the impact on natural heritage sites and the potential failure to adhere to Scottish Government policy as set out in the Draft Electricity Generation Policy Statement 2010 and the National Planning Framework 2 to see biomass deployed in heat-only or combined heat and power schemes off-gas grid at an appropriate scale to make best use of both the available heat and of local supply; observes that the second public consultation period will close on 17 June 2011 and encourages residents in Leith and across Edinburgh to express their views by taking part in the consultation, and believes that, until an independent assessment of the impact of large-scale biomass plants has been undertaken, a moratorium on their development would be highly justified.</p>
<p>Supported by: Graeme Dey*, Kenneth Gibson*, Richard Lyle*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00274 Jim Hume: Freedom of the Borders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the Royal Regiment of Scotland is to be granted the freedom of the Borders at a special ceremony in Melrose; understands that the ceremony will take place on Saturday 11 June 2011 and will feature representation from 1 SCOTS (the Royal Scots Borderers) and 6 SCOTS (52nd Lowland Regiment); considers that this will act as a fitting tribute to the service personnel from the Borders who have served in these two battalions and their precursor regiments as well as those from across Scotland who have served in the Royal Regiment of Scotland&rsquo;s other five battalions, and commends Scottish Borders Council for bestowing this honour on the regiment.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00273 Paul Martin: The St Mungo Heritage Trail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Historic Glasgow on the creation of a heritage trail that stretches between the monastic settlement in Hoddom, Dumfries and Galloway and Provan Hall, the historic seat of the Bishops of Glasgow; notes that the trail will help people both celebrate the life of St Mungo, Patron Saint of Glasgow, and educate them about the ancient ties between Galloway and Glasgow; notes that the trail will be formally opened by the Lord Provost of Glasgow, and offers its best wishes for the future to Historic Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00272 Patricia Ferguson: National Galleries of Scotland Art Competition for Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Peter Carruthers from St Kevin&rsquo;s Primary School in Sighthill, Glasgow, on winning second place in the Special Education Schools category in the National Galleries of Scotland Art Competition for Schools; notes that the competition seeks to encourage young artists and to make the national collection accessible to children at all levels; further notes that this year a record-breaking 5,895 entries were received on themes with an Olympic flavour; congratulates all the winners, who will feature in a 2012 calendar, and encourages people to visit an exhibition of the winning works that will run from 11 June to 19 October 2011 at the Scottish National Gallery.</p>
