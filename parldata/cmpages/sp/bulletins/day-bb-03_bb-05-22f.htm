          <p><strong>*S2M-57</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald: Appointment of 
            Ministers</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes that the requirements 
            of sections 44 and 47 of the Scotland Act 1998 are inconsistent with 
            the duty of the First Minister elected by Parliament to carry out 
            his programme for government along with ministers selected by him 
            to have responsibility for specific portfolios within that programme 
            for government and believes that the Procedures Committee should, 
            as a matter of urgency, review the proceedings surrounding the First 
            Minister&#146;s appointment of his ministerial team in order to petition 
            Her Majesty&#146;s Government for appropriate amendments to the act 
            on the appointment of ministers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-56#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Location of Scottish 
            Water Customer Management Centre</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            expresses its concern about the plans by Scottish Water to locate 
            the new customer management centre in Glasgow or Edinburgh with the 
            resulting loss of 75 civil service jobs in Dundee; believes that there 
            should be a full economic impact assessment that takes account of 
            the impact of this move on the local economy in Dundee before the 
            proposal is approved by the Scottish Executive; questions whether 
            the proposal is consistent with the previously stated aim of dispersing 
            civil service jobs, and considers that the Parliament should ensure 
            that any decision on the siting of the customer management centre 
            is subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-54</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Scotland's Customs 
            Dogs</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern that the 
            customs dogs trained to detect smuggled drugs, money and tobacco are 
            based in Hull and Manchester; further notes with concern that Scotland's 
            ports and airports have only had the services of these dogs for less 
            than 30 days since April 2002; believes that such front-line resources 
            are key to assisting our hard pressed customs officials in the war 
            against drugs and organised crime, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to press by any means necessary for the repatriation of control of 
            this service to the Parliament.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-47*#*</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank: The Need for 
            a New Secondary School in North-East Fife at the Tay Bridgehead</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the longstanding need for a new secondary school 
            at the Tay Bridgehead in north-east Fife; is aware of widespread local 
            community support in the area for such a school; believes that the 
            school is vital to relieve pressure on Madras College, St Andrews, 
            which is the second largest secondary school in Scotland with a pupil 
            roll of 1,850 and on Bell Baxter High School, Cupar; further notes 
            that the relocation of an additional squadron to RAF Leuchars will 
            increase the pressure on the existing secondary schools and exacerbate 
            the current situation, and, given the seriousness of the matter and 
            the fact that little or no progress has been made on it over the last 
            two decades, considers that the Scottish Executive should intervene 
            and make representations to Fife Council to ensure that a new school 
            is secured.</p>

            supported by the overwhelming majority of respondents to the Scottish 
            Executive&#146;s consultation on the draft designation order and by 
            the Rural Development Committee unanimously in the first session of 
            the Parliament, and believes that the Executive should institute an 
            immediate review of the park's boundary.</p>
