<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4330</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Crack Cocaine in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the crack cocaine problem in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, as reported in <em>Holyrood</em>; commends Grampian Police on its substantial seizures to date of this highly addictive and dangerous drug, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide all necessary assistance to help stop the use of this drug, the purchase of which is often funded by crime.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4329</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Pledge Against New Nuclear Power Stations in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the interim report of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) which states &quot;CoRWM takes no position on the desirability or otherwise of nuclear new build. We believe that future decisions on new build should be subject to their own assessment process&quot;; further notes that government advisors on sustainable development have reported that&nbsp;there are issues other than waste management that should rule out new nuclear power, including risk of accident, terrorist threat, security of supply, economic cost and the availability of safe, clean and economic renewable energy and energy efficiency measures; recognises the opposition to nuclear new build in Scotland by the Green, SNP, SSP and Liberal Democrat parties; notes in particular that Nicol Stephen MSP recently stated&nbsp; &quot;The Liberal Democrats have a tough, clear and consistent position across the UK&hellip;.We oppose new nuclear power.... &nbsp;the Liberal Democrats remain determined to oppose this year, next year and every year&quot;, and calls on all political parties opposed to new nuclear power stations in Scotland to pledge that they will not be part of, or support, a Scottish Executive that allows new nuclear power stations to be built, even if the issue of nuclear waste management may be considered to have been resolved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4328</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with PCS Department of Work and Pensions Strikers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its support for members of the PCS who are taking strike action over two days to prevent compulsory redundancies, end attacks on workers&rsquo; rights and defend public services by getting the staffing levels that match public needs; regrets that senior management  refused to make any reasonable or meaningful offer on jobs, services and rights but instead want to forge ahead with the wholesale destruction of jobs, with 15,000 jobs already gone and another 15,000 to go by 2008, and then another 5% cut to the Department of Work and Pensions&rsquo; budget in 2008-9, as announced by Gordon Brown; expresses alarm that cuts have already led to vulnerable people not getting access to the benefits they need, with one million calls unanswered last year and claimants experiencing two-month delays in obtaining benefits which they so desperately need, and believes that the employers and the UK Government should immediately come to the negotiating table prepared to put the needs of people first and prepared to reach an agreement acceptable to PCS members.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4327</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Stirling Schools PPP</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Stirling Council and the Scottish Executive on the completion of the agreements for the &pound;100 million Stirling schools PPP contract and on making unprecedented levels of investment for future generations in Scotland by providing modern, stimulating and innovative learning and teaching facilities for children and young people.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4326</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4325</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of Attacks by Egyptian Police on Pro-Justice Reform Protesters</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern events in Egypt where, following protests in support of the independence of the judiciary between 24 and 27 April 2006, campaigners for justice reform were attacked by riot police and around fifty were arrested; notes that, according to the <em>New York Times</em>, up to 10,000 riot police were deployed in&nbsp;central Cairo on 27 April, beating judges and their supporters who had come to express solidarity with judges, Hisham Bastawisi and Mahmoud Mekki, at their disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice, the two judges having exposed fraud in the recent parliamentary elections; further notes that journalists covering the protests were attacked and threatened by police and, in a separate incident, the chief of the Al Jazeera TV bureau was also arrested; condemns the actions of the Egyptian police in attacking the protesters as well as their further detention under a 15-day extension on charges of disturbing public peace and order; calls on the Egyptian authorities to show respect for human rights and the independence of the Egyptian judiciary by releasing the detainees without delay, and opposes this attempt to silence voices in the judiciary and the media who have exposed electoral fraud, state violence and corruption.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4324</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Replacement Theme Tune for BBC World Cup Football Coverage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the BBC to commission new music to introduce their coverage of the 2006 World Cup football tournament in Germany; calls for the rejection of their recently announced choice, &quot;Sports Prepare&quot;, which is adapted from &quot;See the Conquering Hero Comes&quot;, a hymn in praise of the Duke of Cumberland, the victor at Culloden; notes that its composer, George Frederick Handel, included it in his oratorio, &quot;Judas Maccabaeus&quot;, celebrating the Hanoverian victory over the Jacobites in the rising of 1745-46 which was followed by Cumberland&rsquo;s repression of the Highlanders, backed by his government, that nearly destroyed Gaelic society, language and customs and included near genocide in some areas along with the infliction of indiscriminate punishment against Hanoverian as well as Jacobite clanspeople, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to remind the BBC that in a multicultural age appropriate music for world cup football coverage should not engender memories of oppression and destruction of Gaelic Scotland which is only recovering in our times.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4323</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade Falkirk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk on obtaining Fairtrade status; recognises the important role that Falkirk Council, civic organisations, the churches and local businesses have played in achieving this status; notes the growing support for fair trade products in Scotland and the benefits that this will bring to farmers and communities in developing countries, and encourages other towns across the country to consider becoming Fairtrade towns.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4322</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Word 06 Festival - Aberdeen 12 to 14 May 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the sixth Word &ndash; University of Aberdeen Writers&rsquo; Festival on the programme for this year&rsquo;s festival, which runs from 12 to 14 May 2006; notes that this festival brings together a number of celebrities and international authors with talented authors from the north east and, by so doing, showcases the very best in literature in the Aberdeen area; further notes the involvement of local young people in the very diverse and stimulating programme, and wishes well all those involved in this event which puts Aberdeen and the north east on the literature and cultural map.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4321</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>World Asthma Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that 2 May 2006 is World Asthma Day; understands that there are 390,000 sufferers of this illness in Scotland; recognises that these sufferers are not automatically entitled to free prescriptions despite having a chronic illness; calls on the Scottish Executive to immediately abolish prescription charges for those with chronic health conditions and cancer and thereafter to phase out charges for everyone else in Scotland, and notes that this charging goes against the founding principles of the NHS and is ultimately a tax on ill-health.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4320</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Joint Inspections (Scotland) Regulations 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4319</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (Commencement No. 2 and Consequential Provisions) (Scotland) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4318</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Housing Corporation (Delegation) etc. Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the UK Parliament should consider those provisions of the Housing Corporation (Delegation) etc. Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 30 March 2006, which will legislate in devolved areas in respect of the past operation of the Housing Corporation in Scotland as outlined in LCM (6.1).</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4317</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Police and Justice Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the UK Parliament should consider those provisions of the Police and Justice Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 25 January 2006, which will legislate in devolved areas in respect of the abolition of the Police Information Technology Organisation and the establishment of the National Policing Improvement Agency and the Justice, Community Safety and Custody Inspectorate, and computer misuse, and which will alter the executive competence of the Scottish Ministers on extradition matters, as laid out in LCM(S2) 4.1.</p>
<p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4316</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Falkirk Fairtrade Town</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the many people, including representatives of community groups, businesses, churches, Falkirk Council and the town centre management, whose hard work and dedication have enabled Falkirk to become a Fairtrade Town, and looks forward to the extension of fairtrade status throughout the Falkirk area.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4315</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>World Asthma Day and Asthma Control</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the aim of World Asthma Day on Tuesday 2 May 2006 which highlights the importance of people with asthma being in control of their condition; notes with concern that four out of five people with asthma in the United&nbsp;Kingdom are currently not in control of their condition, resulting in over three million adults experiencing symptoms, such as inability to exercise and lack of sleep, which impact unnecessarily on their daily lives; supports the launch of Asthma UK Scotland&rsquo;s asthma control test, a quick five-part questionnaire designed to help people understand how to control their asthma, and believes that, by raising awareness of this issue, more people will be in control of their asthma, rather than controlled by their asthma.</p>
