<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2425Mary Mulligan:Save West Lothian Pensioners&rsquo; and Disabled People&rsquo;s Concessionary Travel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the SNP and hospital councillor-led administration on West Lothian Council to withdraw the budget of a concessionary travel scheme providing subsidised rail travel for pensioners and disabled people by April 2009; notes that this scheme, started by the previous Labour administration, provides for 130,000 journeys each year at an annual cost to the council of only &pound;110,000, and contributes to meeting targets in the Scottish Government national outcomes document, and calls on the SNP-led administration of West Lothian Council to think again about its rejection of the Labour councillors&rsquo; call to retain this valued concessionary travel scheme and to listen to the many voices in West Lothian that have expressed outrage and disgust at what is seen as a mean-spirited attack on pensioners and disabled people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2424Patrick Harvie:Award-Winning Scottish Social Enterprises</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the ongoing achievements of social enterprises in Scotland in the delivery of high quality services across the country; in particular, celebrates the success of the Wise Group in being named Third Force News&rsquo;s Charity of the Year, Spruce Carpets on being named Scottish Business in the Community Social Enterprise of the Year 2008 and Forth Sector on being named Edge Upstarts Social Enterprise of the Year; congratulates these organisations on winning such prestigious awards, and wishes them every success for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2423#Ian McKee:Childhood and Sport-Related Injuries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the lack of data available in Scotland on childhood and sport-related injuries; understands, however, that Scotland has signed up to the Child Safety Action Plan, part of the European Commission&rsquo;s public health programme that will provide an opportunity to address child safety; observes that Sweden, with its child injury and surveillance system, has the lowest rates of injury and the highest levels of sports activity in Europe, as well as obesity rates half that of the United Kingdom; notes the partnership between NHS Lothian and the Scottish Rugby Union, and hopes that this and similar initiatives to increase sport participation across deprived communities will include provision for surveillance and monitoring of injuries.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2422Margaret Curran:&pound;42 Million of Cuts by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the proposed &pound;42 million of cuts by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde; further notes the comments of Finance Director, Douglas Griffin, in a letter to senior officials that such drastic measures are required as the SNP government&rsquo;s NHS funding settlement for 2008-09 is &quot;significantly lower&quot; than in previous years; is particularly concerned at the impact that such large-scale cuts could have on front-line patient care; condemns the SNP government for its apparent refusal to match the NHS spending increases of both the UK Government for England over the current budget review period and the year-on-year spending increases by the previous Labour-led Scottish Executive, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to step in and provide sufficient funding to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s sick and infirm are not made to pay for the Scottish National Party&rsquo;s poor sense of priorities in government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2421Elaine Smith:Pay Up for PCS Members</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its solidarity with the members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) in the Scottish Government and Registers of Scotland who felt they had no option but to take strike action for a second day over a 2% pay cap; commends Scotland&rsquo;s civil servants for the sterling work they do in providing vital services to the public; notes that while the Scottish Government calls on COSLA to return to the negotiating table to resolve the local government pay dispute, they are ignoring the plight of their own low-paid workers who are suffering an effective pay cut in the current economic climate; regrets that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s failure to act in this matter means that the workers will be continuing an overtime ban and work-to-rule as the strike threatens to escalate with other groups of PCS members, particularly in the Scottish Court Service and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, now balloting to take part in future strikes this autumn, and believes that the Scottish Government should meet the union without delay to negotiate a just pay deal for these valued public servants.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2420Elaine Smith:Fair Play, Fair Pay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its solidarity with the public sector workers, members of the GMB, UNISON and Unite the Union, currently in dispute over pay and conditions; commends their loyal public service, which is vital not only to our economy but also to the quality of life of our citizens; understands that, while no one wants to strike, these workers feel that they have no other choice when faced with a derisory three-year pay deal, which effectively amounts to a pay cut in the current economic climate; feels, in particular, that the burden of inflation and the council tax freeze should not be placed on the lowest-paid workers; believes that the employers must take immediate steps to resolve this dispute by meeting with the trade unions to negotiate a better deal, and further believes that the Scottish Government has a duty to intervene to end this damaging dispute by making the necessary funds available.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2418Margaret Smith:Congratulations to Chris Hoy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh cyclist, Chris Hoy, on winning three gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics; notes that he is the first Briton to win three gold medals at the same Olympics in 100 years; recognises that Hoy&rsquo;s achievements in Olympic track cycling are exceptional; welcomes the inspiration generated as a result of this achievement; calls on the UK Government to bestow a knighthood on him, and wishes Chris the best of luck for the future and looks forward to further success in forthcoming events.</p>
