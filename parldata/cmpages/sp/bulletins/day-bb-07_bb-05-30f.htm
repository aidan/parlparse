<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-93</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Abolition of Bridge Tolls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the concerns of residents and businesses who have been unfairly treated by the retention of tolls on the Forth and Tay road bridges when similar tolls were removed elsewhere; and that in the interests of fairness supports the removal of the tolls from the Forth and Tay road bridges as soon as is practicable and notes the government&rsquo;s intention to engage in dialogue to pursue this objective with the Forth Estuary Transport Authority and the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-92&diams;</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Recognising Success in the Voluntary Sector</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates CVS Fife and Adam Smith College on being awarded the Partnership Award at the inaugural annual Third Force News (TFN) Charity Awards; recognises their huge contribution to the voluntary sector in Fife through the promotion of a programme of free training; notes their successful partnership with local public and private sector organisations to achieve this and believes that they should be supported in building on this excellent work in the future; further recognises that the awards highlight the significant contribution that the voluntary sector makes to Scottish society, and believes that the sector should receive continued support and investment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-91&diams; </strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Autism Parliamentary Network</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament affirms its commitment to work during the new Parliamentary session to improve the lives of people with autistic spectrum disorder; is concerned that, while progress has been made, individuals with autistic spectrum disorder still experience difficulties in accessing the appropriate services and support necessary for them to fulfil their potential, both in Aberdeenshire and across Scotland, and welcomes the development of an Autism Parliamentary Network, co-ordinated by the National Autistic Society Scotland, which will serve as an information channel to support Members of the Scottish Parliament in their endeavours to create a society where autism is fully understood and where people with autistic spectrum disorder are fully respected and supported and receive timely, quality services that are appropriate to their individual needs.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-90</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Rule 2.3.1</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following dates under Rule 2.3.1: 30 June - 2 September 2007 (inclusive), 6 - 21 October 2007 (inclusive), 22 December 2007 - 4 January 2008 (inclusive), 9 - 17 February 2008 (inclusive), 29 March - 13 April 2008 (inclusive) and 28 June - 31 August 2008 (inclusive).</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-87</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following revision to the programme of business for Thursday 31 May 2007&mdash;</p>
<p>after,</p>

<p>replace,</p>
<p><em>followed </em>by&#9;Executive Business</p>
<p>with,</p>
<p><em>followed </em>by&#9;Executive Debate: Rural Development Programme</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-86#</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Johnston Newspapers Decision to Stop Printing in Falkirk</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by Johnston Newspapers to cease operations in printing the <em>Falkirk Herald </em>in Falkirk from August 2007; notes that Johnston Newspapers was founded in Falkirk and for over 200 years has continuously printed the Falkirk Herald in Falkirk, making it the largest-selling local newspaper in Scotland, and believes that the decision should be re-evaluated and that the same loyalty should be shown to the workforce and town of Falkirk as has been shown to Johnston Newspapers by the people of Falkirk district.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bob Doris<strong>*</strong>, Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-85&diams;</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Water Rates and Charitable Organisations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the likely impact of water rates on charitable organisations across central Scotland, such as Kildrum Parish Church and the British Heart Foundation in Cumbernauld, once the present rate exemption scheme ends in 2010; acknowledges that a wide range of voluntary and church-based organisations in central Scotland and nationwide have enjoyed rate relief on water and sewerage charges for activities on their premises, and considers that the excellent work done by charities in communities all across Scotland should be recognised and that the long-term future of the many organisations that would be burdened with water and sewerage rates should be supported and safeguarded by the exemption period being extended beyond 2010.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-84</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Parliamentary Development</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that under its auspices a non-policy-making research, development and monitoring unit should be established to report on the effectiveness of the Parliament&rsquo;s present powers and relationships as defined in the Scotland Act 1998 and to probe whether these need amendment in the light of changes to EU powers, to investigate areas which may benefit from changes to or extension of the powers conferred by the Scotland Act because of technological or other reasons, to report on the Memorandum of Understanding and Co-operation and the relationships with the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly, on an issue-by-issue basis, without prescription or proscription, to examine how different levels of autonomy, including sovereignty, might affect public services and, using the Parliament&rsquo;s resources, to publicise the outcome of such investigation.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-80*#*</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Can&rsquo;t Afford to Foster</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the valuable contribution made by Scotland&rsquo;s foster carers; notes with concern that there is a shortage of 1,700 fostering households in Scotland, including in the Scottish Borders; further notes that, at a time when more children, many of whom display challenging behaviour, are living with foster carers than at any other time, 37% of foster carers receive no payment at all while two-thirds of those who are paid receive less than the minimum wage, and accordingly considers that the fostering network should be supported as a matter of priority.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-72*#*</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Milton and Chirnsyde Community Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament praises the continued courage and determination of the local community in the Glasgow Milton area in standing up against organised crime; thanks community activists who have worked tirelessly to ensure that community facilities provided in the area are safe for the local community to use, and looks forward to the speedy reopening of the Chirnsyde Community Initiative with a new management committee that will provide a range of much-needed local services for the people of Milton and Ashfield.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-59*#*</strong> <strong>Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Tartan Day Celebrations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament compliments the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the Scottish Executive, Angus Council and other Scottish local authorities for their work in developing the concept of Tartan Day, which marks an annual celebration of the historical enactment of the Arbroath Declaration made on 6 April 1320 and seeks to renew the close historical, cultural, trading and other links between Scotland and the rest of the world, with particular attention being paid to countries where the Scottish diaspora is greatest and encourages the development of individual and international friendship and goodwill through Tartan Day celebrations.</p>
<p>Supported by: David McLetchie<strong>*</strong>, Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong>, Jeremy Purvis<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-50</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Single Transferable Vote</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the single transferable vote deeply disadvantages candidates with surnames towards the end of the alphabet when two or more candidates from a single party stand in the same council ward; is aware that in Cunninghame North, in the eight instances that two or more candidates from either the Conservative, Labour or Scottish National party stood, in every case the candidate whose surname came first in the alphabet obtained a much higher number of votes for that ward than colleagues whose surnames were further on in the alphabet; notes that the bigger the alphabetic gap the bigger the gulf in votes; is aware that this took place even on the two occasions where surnames were grouped by party and that the pattern was repeated elsewhere in Scotland, and therefore resolves, in the interests of fairness, that where more than one candidate from a party stands, their position on the ballot paper should be decided by lottery.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-50.1</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>The Single Transferable Vote</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-50) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out &quot;lottery&quot; and insert &quot;the party submitting their names.&quot;</p>
