<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>S3M-7361# Kenneth Gibson: Epilepsy Awareness Training</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that there would be merit in epilepsy training becoming an integral part of the student teacher training course curriculum so that teaching staff are equipped to detect potential seizures in children and young people and can be proactive in providing appropriate support to pupils with epilepsy and agrees that this could boost teacher confidence in handling as many as 7,000 children in Scotland with active epilepsy, enable early detection of seizures in over 800 children each year, provide more tailored learning and emotional support to normalise the condition and reduce classroom stigma for children in North Ayrshire and across Scotland.</p>
