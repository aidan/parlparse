          <p><strong>*S1M-3306</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Greater Glasgow 
            Acute Services Review</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            decision of the Minister for Health and Community Care to support 
            the Greater Glasgow NHS Board plan for acute hospital services across 
            Glasgow; believes that this decision fails to take account of overwhelming 
            opposition expressed by citizens throughout Glasgow to the reduction 
            of acute receiving centres to only two for the whole city; further 
            believes that the Greater Glasgow NHS Board did not properly consult 
            the citizens of Glasgow about its plans and ignored the response to 
            the limited consultation that took place which rejected the proposals 
            to reduce the status of both the Victoria and Stobhill Hospitals; 
            has no confidence in the ability of the Greater Glasgow NHS Board 
            to reflect the opinions or demands of the Glasgow population; further 
            believes that the proposals will leave Glasgow inadequately served 
            in relation to emergencies and the number of acute receiving beds 
            across the city, and calls on the Minister for Health and Community 
            Care to reconsider his position and refuse to support the unrepresentative 
            proposals of the Greater Glasgow NHS Board.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3305</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Greater Pollok 
            Citizens Advice Bureau</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Greater Pollok Citizens Advice Bureau in securing full membership 
            of Citizens Advice Scotland in record time after the board and staff 
            underwent a major quality assurance audit; notes the heavy and increasing 
            workload of the bureau, and urges the Scottish Executive to commit 
            more and new resources in order to provide genuinely independent money, 
            debt and legal advice services and trained personnel throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3304</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: UK Position on 
            Iraq</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the continued threats 
            by George W Bush and the USA to affect a &quot;regime change&quot; 
            in Iraq by any means necessary; condemns the USA&#146;s bully-boy 
            tactics and its international sabre-rattling, which does nothing to 
            build greater unity, peace and harmony throughout our diverse world; 
            believes that the USA is increasingly isolated in its war-mongering 
            intentions to invade Iraq despite opposition from across Europe and 
            even from within the United Nations; calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to issue a clear statement of opposition to involvement in any attack 
            on Iraq in the interests of promoting greater world peace and harmony, 
            and further believes that, should Her Majesty&#146;s Government commit 
            any support, physically or financially, to an American-led attack 
            on Iraq, a special debate should be arranged immediately in the Parliament. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3303</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Flood Victims 
            in Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive 
            to promise financial aid to flood victims in the east end of Glasgow 
            whose possessions have been wiped out in floods that devastated their 
            homes; believes that council tenants and some pensioner private owners 
            should not be blamed for not being insured in an area that is officially 
            the most deprived in Britain; notes that human error did not prevent 
            the Holyrood building from being bailed out when costs soared from 
            £40 million to almost £300 million; further notes that the divisive 
            contrast between flood victims in poverty being left without funds 
            or furniture in Glasgow and the creation of a parliament building 
            in Edinburgh with comforts for politicians is against the Parliament's 
            caring ethos, and appeals for common sense and humanity to prevail.

          <p><strong>*S1M-3302</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Scottish Law Commission 
            Report on Title to Sue for Non-Patrimonial Loss</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes the publication of the Scottish 
            Law Commission report, <em>Title to Sue for Non-Patrimonial Loss</em>; 
            further notes that the reprt identifies that family structures found 
            in contemporary Scotland differ greatly from those found in 1976 when 
            current legislation covering non-patrimonial loss came into force 
            and that the exclusion of same-sex couples and siblings from those 
            entitled to claim damages for non-patrimonial loss under the Damages 
            (Scotland) Act 1976 highlights this difference, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to bring forward legislation as a matter of urgency in order 
            to fully adopt the report&#146;s recommendations.</a></p>
