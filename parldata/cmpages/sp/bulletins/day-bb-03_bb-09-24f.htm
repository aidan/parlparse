          <p><strong>*S2M-408</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Solidarity 
            with Pensioners Protesting about Council Tax in England</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates the pensioners in the West Country who 
            are protesting at the steep council tax rises in England; sends a 
            message of solidarity to their campaign for non-payment of the unfair 
            and regressive council tax; notes that the Liberal Democrat conference 
            on 23 September 2003 called for the abolition of the council tax and 
            its replacement by an income-based system, and calls on the Scottish 
            Liberal Democrat part of the coalition in the Scottish Executive to 
            initiate this policy in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-407</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Criminal 
            Justice Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees 
            that, in addition to the provisions referred to in motion S1M-3671, 
            those further matters which have been brought forward in the Criminal 
            Justice Bill and that relate to devolved matters should be considered 
            by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-406</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            National Theatre</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement 
            of Scottish Executive funding to realise the National Theatre of Scotland; 
            commends the Executive on its vision in supporting the radical concept 
            of a commissioning theatre of national and international status to 
            present theatrical and writing excellence to all the people of Scotland 
            and take Scotland's creative talent to the world stage, and endorses 
            the Executive's commitment to the infrastructure of Scottish regional 
            theatre from which new work will come.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-405</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Army 
            Display in the Parliament</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses 
            its opposition to the army display at the reception area in Parliamentary 
            Headquarters on 23 September 2003; notes that since defence is a reserved 
            matter there is therefore no reason for a display by the army in the 
            Parliament; feels very strongly that the time is not suitable because 
            of the humanitarian and political disaster in Iraq, with parents of 
            young men and women serving there wondering whether their children 
            will come home alive; questions why there is a recruitment display 
            by the army when other companies are not permitted to advertise in 
            the Parliament, and considers that the invitation to the army to display 
            in the Parliament should be withdrawn immediately and not be repeated.</p>

            circumstances since 1995 at the Deepcut Army Barracks in Aldershot 
            for a full and independent public inquiry into their deaths and believes

            should be subject to a national referendum; believes that the proposed 
            constitutional treaty for the European Union represents such a major 
            change and accordingly should be the subject of such a referendum, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to convey the Parliament&#146;s

            welcomes the recognition by the First Minister of the need to &quot;regain 
            trust and confidence&quot; in our criminal justice system; believes 
            that a step towards restoring such confidence would be to introduce 
            honesty in sentencing by re-enacting sections 33 to 41 of the Crime 
            and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997, which were repealed by section 
            108 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998; notes that public confidence 
            has been further undermined by the lack of visible policing in too 
            many communities, and calls on the Scottish Executive to consider 
            how accountability to the public in the delivery of police services 
            might be enhanced.</p>
