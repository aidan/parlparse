        prices have risen in excess of 25%; further notes that Scottish public services are being
        forced to operate under ever increasing financial constraints; recognises that the
        increased cost of fuel is a burden which must be carried not just by motorists, but which
        falls on all Scottish citizens through rising fuel costs to the public sector; believes
        that it is unacceptable that money should be diverted from over-stretched Scottish public
        service budgets to the Treasury in Westminster, and therefore calls upon the Scottish
        Executive to consider extending the fuel duty rebate and to examine the possibility of
        extending the availability of rebated fuel across Scotland&#146;s public services in order
        to ensure that money spent on Scottish services is spent here rather than being returned
        to London. </p>

        Learning Committee into the bulk purchase of fuel for remote areas; welcomes the progress
        made by the Scottish Executive in implementing a comprehensive integrated transport
        strategy and investing in public transport projects across Scotland; in particular notes
        support for rural public transport services and the network for petrol stations in rural
        Scotland, as well as measures to sustain lifeline air and ferry links, including the
        Highlands and Islands; and further notes that the current budget for the fuel duty rebate
        would have no impact on Treasury receipts but would be a cost to the current budget for
        Scottish public services.</p>
