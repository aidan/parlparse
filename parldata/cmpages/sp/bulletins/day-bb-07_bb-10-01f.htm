          <p><strong>S3M-569</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Sikh Rights in Ireland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses disappointment at the recent Irish Government backing for the An Guarda Siochana, the Irish police force, ruling stating that a trainee Sikh police officer would not be given permission to wear his turban on duty; acknowledges the fact that the turban is a mandatory article of the Sikh faith and that this ruling effectively excludes the whole Sikh community from joining the An Guarda Siochana; believes that this position is directly opposed to comments by the Minister for Integration in his inaugural speech in July 2007 that &quot;I&rsquo;m open to all of your ideas and all of your contributions, because when I look down through this room today I see the citizens for the future. I see the tax payers of the future. I see the people who are going to bring Ireland into a new and very much brighter century, a century that will be more affluent, more open, more tolerant than the one that I was born into here in Ireland&quot; and Ireland&rsquo;s own social blueprint for the future, <em>Towards 2016, Ten-Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015</em>, which states as one of its main aims for the future that &quot;Every person, irrespective of background or gender, would enjoy equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination&quot;, and expresses the hope that through due process this decision will be overturned.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-533</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Pass Plus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the combined initiative of South Lanarkshire Council Road Safety Team, South Lanarkshire Community Safety Partnership and Strathclyde Fire and Rescue to offer new drivers a &pound;75 grant towards the cost of the Pass Plus scheme; notes that this scheme could make a considerable contribution towards reducing accidents on our roads, and applauds the various bodies involved for making the scheme more accessible to young people throughout South Lanarkshire.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-532</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>3TFM</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the volunteers and board of directors, chaired by Louis Ferguson, of 3TFM on securing a community radio licence for the next five years, enabling it to broadcast to the three towns of Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenston for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; notes that 3TFM is one of only four radio stations in the United Kingdom to have been awarded such a licence by Ofcom and the only one in Scotland; recognises that 3TFM will focus on improving the health and wellbeing of the communities it serves; is aware that 3TFM began in 2004 when determined volunteers with no previous broadcasting experience created a professional, well-run radio station sending out entertaining programmes with a health message, providing 672 hours of music over 28 days and training 150 volunteers, 30 live presenters and studio crew; notes that it will be live on the air from 17 November 2007 for 28 days in preparation for the new licence, and believes that the commitment, energy and enthusiasm of everyone at 3TFM will take the new station from strength to strength.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-531</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Save the Sumatran Rainforest</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges and supports the campaign by the RSPB and Burung Indonesia, part of the BirdLife International partnership, to restore an area of Sumatra&rsquo;s lowland rainforest, the Harapan (hope) Rainforest; recognises that Sumatra has lost 97% of its rainforest, 16 million hectares, in under a century to unsustainable, often illegal, development, particularly logging activity; is aware that some of Earth&rsquo;s most critically endangered species live in the Sumatran rainforest, a fragile habitat vulnerable to the devastating impact of deforestation, including 600 species of bird, the world&rsquo;s largest flower, Rafflesia arnoldii, the Asian elephant, Malaysian tapir and the Sumatran tiger, where numbers are now reduced in the wild to fewer than 300; believes that restoration of the Harapan Rainforest would ensure the survival of a rich and diverse wildlife habitat vital to the prosperity of its indigenous people, and acknowledges that this ambitious project will help the development of scientific research and provide sustainable employment in wildlife monitoring, replanting, managing and eco-tourism.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-465#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>NDCS Change Your World Consultation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the National Deaf Children&rsquo;s Society (NDCS) on its groundbreaking Change Your World consultation exercise, which represents the first ever discussion with young deaf and hearing-impaired people in Scotland and the United Kingdom about the issues and challenges which affect them; believes that deafness and other hearing impairments should not be a barrier for children in achieving their true potential; acknowledges the work of the NDCS in representing the interests of all deaf children and young people from birth until they reach independence; welcomes this opportunity to engage with young deaf Scots, and considers that as many young people as possible in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and across Scotland with a hearing impairment should be encouraged to get involved and make their voice heard.</p>
