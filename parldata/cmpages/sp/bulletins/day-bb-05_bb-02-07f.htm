         <p><strong> Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

         <p><strong> * S2M-2380</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh: The Conservation of Salmon (Esk Salmon Fishery District) Regulations 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Environment and Rural Development Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Conservation of Salmon (Esk Salmon Fishery District) Regulations 2005 (SSI 2005/24).</p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2379</strong> <strong>Frances Curran: Keep CalMac Public</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the RMT union on its campaign to keep Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd (CalMac) ferries in public ownership, despite the refusal of the First Minister to make a clear statement that he was committed to public ownership of our ferries; condemns the pre-emptive decision to invite tenders for the Gourock to Dunoon route and supports the CalMac workers in their legitimate right to take industrial action to defend jobs and services should they decide to take such action; congratulates Bob Crow, the RMT General Secretary, on his record of defending his members&rsquo; jobs and conditions in the face of an onslaught of privatisation of our formerly public transport systems, and condemns statements made on BBC Radio Scotland by Alasdair Morrison MSP unjustly attacking Bob Crow and accusing him of having no concern for the communities served by CalMac when it is the Scottish Executive which is showing its lack of concern for these communities by moving to privatise their vital lifeline services.</p>

         <p><strong> * S2M-2377</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Reduce the Risk of Cancer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Cancer Research UK on the launch of its five-year Reduce the Risk campaign to raise awareness of the avoidable risks of cancer and the importance of early detection; recognises that one in three of us will be diagnosed with cancer at some time in our lives but that half of all cancers could be prevented by changes to lifestyle; expresses concern that, of those questioned by the charity in Scotland, 70% did not know that a diet low in fruit and vegetables could increase the chances of getting the disease, only 37% mentioned drinking less alcohol as a way of reducing risk, but almost one-third believed that living near power lines was linked to cancer despite there being no strong evidence to support this, and looks to the Scottish Executive, in the light of these findings, to make cancer prevention a priority in health improvement plans and to continue to support Cancer Research UK&rsquo;s public communication campaign.</p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2376# Mr John Swinney: Boundaries of the Cairngorms National Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the current boundaries of the Cairngorm National Park differ from those originally recommended by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) following extensive consultation on behalf of the Scottish Executive; notes that, as a result of these boundaries, large parts of Highland Perthshire and East Perthshire are excluded from the national park; recognises the strength of support within these areas for participation and involvement in the national park; considers that the case for designation of the Cairngorms as a World Heritage Site would be strengthened by the inclusion of the Perthshire area in the park, and considers that the Executive should conduct an early review of the boundaries of the national park and extend the current boundary to that originally proposed by SNH.</p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2375 Frances Curran: The Right to Protest</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the right to peaceful protest is a fundamental right which underpins our democracy; further believes that there should be absolutely no attempt to use repressive laws to prevent or ban any peaceful demonstrations against George Bush and the G8 leaders when they meet at Gleneagles in July; considers that in a democracy we have the democratic right to challenge the policies and actions of these leaders; hopes that the Scottish Executive has no intention of using any repressive measures to prevent this, and will actively challenge any attempt to deny our civil rights.</p>

         <p><strong> S2M-2372<strong> #</strong> Roseanna Cunningham: G8 Summit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the G8 Summit being held in Gleneagles, Perthshire, from 6 to 8 July 2005, offers an opportunity for Scotland to debate issues related to international aid, trade justice and debt relief; acknowledges that there will be inconvenience and disruption to many communities as a result of hosting this summit, and is of the view that such disruption can only be justified if the representatives of those countries with the greatest economic power arrive at decisions which will allow countries in the developing world to grow and prosper, at their own pace and in their own way, by the provision of appropriately-targeted aid, debt relief and a just framework of trade rules.</p>

         <p><strong> S2M-2369 Margaret Mitchell: Recovery, Reuse and Recycling of Mobile Phones and Printer Cartridges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of Eurosource, a Falkirk-based company, which has become an international leader in the recovery, reuse and recycling of mobile phones and printer cartridges; welcomes its innovative approach and individual customer-tailored collection programmes which have resulted in a significant reduction in environmental damage; applauds the company&rsquo;s contributions of almost &pound;1.5 million to charities, schools and scout groups since its inception five years ago; recognises the benefits of the company&rsquo;s corporate social responsibility ethos and its work with schools which helps youngsters to learn about the environment, enterprise and citizenship, and considers that, within the Scottish Executive and Scottish local authorities, everything possible should be done to encourage the recovery, reuse and recycling of mobile phones and printer cartridges.</p>

         <p><strong> S2M-2367<strong> #</strong> Mrs Nanette Milne: Call for Action on the A90</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the number of road accidents on the A90 north of Aberdeen between Tipperty and Balmedie; further notes the significant number of new houses in and around the Ellon area which have added to the high volumes of traffic on this already congested road, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take action to upgrade this stretch of road as a matter of extreme urgency.</p>

         <p><strong> S2M-2365 Murdo Fraser: Wind Farm on Salisbury Crags</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the proposal by Calton Hill Energy to construct a wind farm on Salisbury Crags in Edinburgh and the contribution that this proposal will make to public attitudes in the city towards onshore wind turbine developments; agrees that it makes sense to construct wind turbines close to areas of population density where most power is consumed rather than in remote and rural areas; looks forward to seeing proposals for the construction of wind turbines on the roofs of prominent Edinburgh buildings such as Edinburgh Castle, St Giles, the Balmoral Hotel and the Palace of Holyroodhouse,&nbsp;and believes that the Scottish Parliamentary&nbsp;Corporate Body should investigate the possibility of erecting 125-metre-high turbines on the roof of the Holyrood building.</p>

         <p><strong> S2M-2362 Tommy Sheridan: No Extradition of the NatWest Three</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes it is a fundamental right of any citizen to be presumed innocent until properly and legally found guilty of any crime; notes that three men, David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew, also known as the NatWest Three, have been accused of crimes of fraud within the United States of America (USA) in connection with incidents, or apparent incidents, which allegedly took place in Britain; believes that it is therefore essential that any criminal trial against these three men takes place in Britain and that the UK Government resists any attempt to extradite these men to a country where a fair trial is much less likely to take place, and therefore calls on the Home Office to refuse to extradite David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew to the USA and to ensure that any criminal prosecution is heard in a British court, consistent with the comment of Caroline Flint MP on 23 June 2003 when she said &ldquo;the trial should take place in the country where the crime is alleged to have been committed&rdquo;.</p>

         <p><strong> S2M-2317<strong> #</strong> Nora Radcliffe: Responsible Deer Management</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the collaborative work on responsible deer management being undertaken in Scotland and the vital role of deer management groups and their use of the Deer Commission for Scotland&rsquo;s best practice guidance; acknowledges the importance of culling deer using such guidance to avoid poor condition of deer in late winter and unnecessary death by starvation or as a consequence of inadequate habitat and shelter to support them; notes the support of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in ensuring that culling is carried out professionally and humanely; recognises the contribution that sustainable deer management can make to sustaining rural development, with increased rural employment and public benefits such as habitat regeneration, enhanced biodiversity and reducing risk of road accidents; considers that deer management groups should take the issue forward constructively, implementing deer management planning and setting targets that can be monitored to ensure progress, and concludes that deer management groups should be supported by representation from wider public interests, including local community, recreational and conservation interests, which would be particularly useful during preparation and review of deer management plans.</p>
