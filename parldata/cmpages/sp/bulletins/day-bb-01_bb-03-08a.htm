                        recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease, its sympathy

                        the loss of their livelihoods, its concern about the general 

                        impact on the economy of the areas affected and its appreciation 

                        of the work of those fighting to contain the spread of 

                        the disease; affirms its support for the measures taken 

                        to date to control the spread of the disease; welcomes 

                        the introduction of the licensed movement of livestock 

                        to abattoirs, and calls upon the Scottish Executive, acting 

                        in concert with Her Majesty’s Government and the European 

                        Union, to ensure that all meat imports are subject to
