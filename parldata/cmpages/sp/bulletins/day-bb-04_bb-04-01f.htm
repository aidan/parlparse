          <p> <strong>*S2M-1140</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Swimming 
            for Senior Citizens</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the actions 
            of North Lanarkshire Council which has increased the cost of swimming 
            in its baths and leisure centres for pensioners by 200%; believes 
            that the actions of the council are contrary to the policies of the 
            Scottish Executive in promoting the health and well-being of our nation, 
            particularly older people; recognises that swimming is an accessible 
            method of keeping fit for those older people experiencing some form 
            of ill health or as a formal part of their medical care; notes that 
            the price change will adversely affect pensioners who will not be 
            able to afford this increase and who will consequently cease their 
            participation, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
            deliver a national policy of free swimming for older people throughout 
            Scotland.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1138</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>The 
            Kenny Macintyre Media Centre</strong>-That the Parliament hopes that 
            the name &quot;Kenny Macintyre Media Centre&quot; as the title of 
            the Parliament's current media centre will continue to be used in 
            the new parliament building.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1137#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Standard 
            Life Job Losses</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the decision 
            by Standard Life to sack 1,000 staff by the end of the year; is not 
            convinced that the company will reduce risk to its customers or staff 
            by these measures and notes with concern the long-term impact on staff 
            and policyholders of the move towards demutualisation announced today, 
            and considers it to be imperative that the company should open talks 
            with a recognised trade union to ensure that staff are protected and 
            treated fairly at this time.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1136#</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Scotland's 
            Equine Sports Industry</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the 
            importance of Scotland's equine sports industry for the development 
            of Scotland's rural economy; commends the work of the Scottish Equestrian 
            Association in seeking to coordinate equine-related policy decisions, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should set up a dedicated 
            equine industry team within its Environment and Rural Affairs Department.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1134</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Remembering 
            Mick McGahey</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Midlothian 
            Trades Union Council for organising a night to commemorate the life 
            of Michael McGahey, the former leader of the National Union of Miners 
            in Scotland; notes the success of last year's inaugural event; further 
            notes that the 2004 event will take place in Loanhead Miners Welfare 
            Society and Social Club on Saturday 1 May 2004, and wishes Michael 
            McGahey's family, friends and comrades a successful night.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1133</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>May 
            Day 2004 Edinburgh</strong>-That the Parliament wishes every success 
            to the Edinburgh May Day committee and its 2004 celebrations to mark 
            International Workers Day; notes that this year's theme is to commemorate 
            the 20th anniversary of the 1984-85 miners' strike, and further notes 
            that Arthur Scargill, former leader of the National Union of Miners, 
            Tommy Sheridan MSP, Bill Speirs, General Secretary of the Scottish 
            Trades Union Council, Hilary Wainwright, Editor of <em>Red Pepper</em> 
            magazine and a Palestinian representative will lead the parade through 
            the centre of Edinburgh on Saturday 1 May.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1132</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> <strong>Chardon 
            LL Maize</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by 
            Bayer Crop Science that it will not attempt to grow Chardon LL GM 
            maize in the UK commercially; notes that this is the result of the 
            tough, restrictive regime supported by the Scottish Executive; believes 
            that this announcement fully justifies the precautionary approach, 
            based on scientific evidence, that the Executive has taken; further 
            believes that calls for an illegal blanket ban on GM could have been 
            challenged in the courts and led to court approval for commercial 
            planting of a GM crop, and calls on the Executive to continue to deliver 
            more sustainable agriculture, promoting organic farming, consumer 
            choice and quality Scottish produce.</P>

            Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Smith<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1132.1</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Chardon 
            LL Maize</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1132) in the name 
            of Nora Radcliffe, leave out from &quot;tough&quot; to &quot;continue&quot; 
            and insert &quot;poor performance of Chardon LL as a crop; further 
            notes how this poor performance could be used by the Scottish Executive 
            as a valid reason to reject the addition of the crop to the UK seed 
            list; believes that the Executive is failing to use its wide legal 
            powers of discretion as exercised by EU states in relation to GM crops; 
            further believes that the Executive is relying on the fortuitous decisions 
            of biotechnology companies to make those decisions it is unwilling 
            to make itself, and calls on the Executive.&quot;</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1131</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            on the Building of the New Dawn</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            John MacLennan, John Leckie, Mark Dunley, Ian Gwyn, Thomas Taylor 
            and Gary Hynde, all recovering heroin addicts, who built a Ness Yoal, 
            the New Dawn, and launched it on 27 March 2004 at Invergordon, and 
            further congratulates Colin Beattie who supervised the building of 
            the boat, with the help of the Galgael Trust in Govan and Alness Mothers 
            Against Drugs who set up the project with National Lottery funding 
            and New Futures money from Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1130</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>218 
            Time Out Centre, Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 
            establishment of the Scottish Executive funded time out centre, 218, 
            an assessment and referral service to assist in reducing women's offending 
            and the number of women in prison; supports the work undertaken at 
            218 to tackle the root causes of women's offending by offering programmes 
            of care, support and development designed to stop women offending 
            by tackling substance misuse driven by trauma and poverty; is particularly 
            encouraged by the menu of programmes to meet these needs including 
            SAFE, working towards recovery including learning to work with a key 
            worker, substitute prescribing, getting somewhere to live, reducing 
            offending and claiming benefits, CONNEXIONS, more sustained group 
            work, helping women let go of substance misuse and offending, handling 
            reality and learning to look after others as well as themselves, LOSS, 
            letting go of substances, activating plans for a new life in education, 
            work as carers and therapeutic work to begin to address the underlying 
            issues of abuse, neglect, violence and other traumas; notes that women 
            in Glasgow can access this service from court, prison or by themselves 
            if they have had a period of custody in the previous 12 months, and 
            considers that the emphasis on tackling the root causes of women's 
            offending and developing a person-centred alternative lifestyle is 
            a positive development that should be given greater emphasis in the 
            criminal justice system.</P>
