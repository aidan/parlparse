            Bill be completed by 19 December 2002.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2946</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie: Enterprise 
            and Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the relatively poor performance of the Scottish economy compared to 
            that of the UK economy as a whole; believes that public funding of 
            enterprise programmes should be focused on infrastructure improvements 
            which benefit all businesses; further notes the damaging effects of 
            the higher business rate poundage in Scotland compared with the rest 
            of the UK, and supports the reintroduction of a uniform business rate 
            across the UK and calls for a fundamental review of the role and functions 
            of the enterprise network, both with the objective of improving growth 
            and competitiveness in the Scottish economy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2945</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Transport</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the importance of transport to the economy in 
            delivering growth and investment to Scotland; further notes that the 
            Scottish Executive&#146;s stewardship of transport issues has been 
            characterised by chaos and muddle, evidenced by strikes, increased 
            congestion, poor maintenance of local roads and unreliable public 
            transport; regrets that the long-awaited transport delivery plan launched 
            by the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning on 
            21 March 2002 contains no concrete plans for funding and delivering 
            desperately needed improvements to Scotland&#146;s transport infrastructure 
            and services and, in particular, gives no details of new trunk road 
            improvements beyond 2004-05, and calls upon the Executive to make 
            a clear commitment to investing in transport for the benefit of the 
            economy and the travelling public.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2944#</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon: Register of Pensioners' 
            Groups</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the work undertaken 
            by pensioners to create local elderly forums as a means of increasing 
            their democratic participation; recognises that this is inhibited 
            by the inadequate and sparse detail currently held on pensioners&#146; 
            groups in Scotland, and encourages the Scottish Executive to give 
            further consideration to the establishment of a standard local authority 
            register of pensioner groups in order to facilitate a crucial basis 
            of communication with such groups and promote empowerment through 
            easy access to information, which will allow pensioners&#146; issues 
            to be pursued on a much broader basis.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2943</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Welcome to Professor 
            Karen Vousden at the Beatson Institute</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the announcement by Cancer Research UK on 15 March of a £10 
            million grant for the Beatson Institute in Glasgow; notes that this 
            support will enable the west of Scotland cancer centre to become a 
            world centre for cancer research; further notes that this commitment 
            to the Beatson Institute is particularly welcome as a clear indication 
            of confidence in the institute, and calls on MSPs of all parties to 
            welcome Professor Karen Vousden as the new director of the Beatson 
            Institute and wish her every success in advancing gene therapy to 
            the benefit of cancer patients throughout Scotland and the world.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2942</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: World's Biggest 
            Burns Supper</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">congratulates 
            the Lord Provost of Glasgow for successfully hosting the world&#146;s 
            biggest Burns Supper on Friday 25 January 2002 and raising £34,500 
            to be donated to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, 
            Marie Curie Cancer Care and The Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice.</a></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2941.1</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson: Tourism</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S1M-2941) in the name of Mike Watson , leave 
            out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the 
            distinct lack of performance by the Scottish Executive in assisting 
            the tourism industry to be internationally competitive and create 
            more jobs; considers that, after five months of consultation, the 
            <em>Tourism</em> <em>Framework for Action 2002-05</em> spells out the 
            obvious and provides no real vision for focusing on the real challenges 
            faced by the different regions in Scotland in order to promote tourism 
            opportunities through a targeted marketing approach, and believes 
            that it is entirely unacceptable that the only role the Minister for 
            Tourism, Culture and Sport will play is to head a Steering Group while 
            the Executive takes responsibility for a mere 10% of the actions outlined 
            in the framework without allowing business input into the strategy 
            behind the action plan. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2941.2</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Tourism</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S1M-2941) in the name of Mike Watson, leave 
            out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the damage 
            caused to the tourism industry by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease 
            and the events of 11 September 2001; further notes that the underlying 
            problems of the high pound and high fuel costs remain; notes with 
            concern that the Scottish Executive&#146;s<em> Tourism Framework for 
            Action 2002-05</em> contains no additional funding; calls on the Executive 
            to promote marketing and accessibility for the sector, and further 
            calls for action to open new air routes to Scotland and to make VisitScotland, 
            not the British Tourist Authority, responsible for marketing Scotland 
            abroad.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2940.1</strong> <strong>David McLetchie: Size of the 
            Scottish Parliament</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-2940) 
            in the name of Patricia Ferguson, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out 
            from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;further notes 
            public disillusionment with the performance of the Parliament to date; 
            believes that reducing the number of MSPs to 108 in line with the 
            provisions of the Scotland Act would be a welcome step towards establishing 
            public confidence in the institution of the Parliament, and considers 
            that a smaller, more focused Parliament would better fulfil the objective 
            of &quot;doing less, better.&quot;</a></p>
