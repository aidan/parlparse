Stadium Project</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the important social and 
economic benefits of the Falkirk Community Stadium Project to Falkirk District; 
further notes with dismay the intransigence and lack of co-operation from Network 
Rail on this project, in attempting to hold the local community to ransom over 
access rights, and considers that Network Rail should recognise the important 
value that this development has to the local community and reconsider its position 
in favour of the local community.</P><P>Supported by: Linda Fabiani, Alex Neil, 
Andrew Wilson, Mr Gil Paterson</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3725#</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms Margo 
MacDonald: War with Iraq</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament, as the primary forum 
for the expression of opinion in Scotland, and with Scottish members of the armed 
forces now committed to preparations for aggressive military action against Iraq, 
declares its right to oppose war with Iraq without prior, specific approval for 
such action by the United Nations Security Council.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Adam 
Ingram, Mr Lloyd Quinan, Mr Gil Paterson, Alex Neil, Tommy Sheridan, Robin Harper, 
Dennis Canavan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3724</STRONG> <STRONG>Margaret Smith: Mental

<STRONG>Angus MacKay: Ethical Investment</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
the work of Edinburgh University People and Planet group and the decision of the 
Edinburgh University Students&#146; Association to endorse overwhelmingly a motion 
on ethical investment during its general meeting; congratulates students that 
have chosen to highlight the issue on the university campus by campaigning that 
the University of Edinburgh&#146;s investments of £160 million should be invested 
only in ethical companies that do not flout human rights, exploit workers, pollute 
heavily or irresponsibly sell armaments; welcomes the decision of the University 
Court to make available previously confidential information about investments 
as a first step in achieving these aims but considers that the University of Edinburgh 
should go further by developing a fully accountable ethical investment policy, 
and believes that other universities in the United Kingdom should develop similar 
policies based on the shared values of their staff and students.</P><P>Supported 
by: Brian Fitzpatrick<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3718</STRONG> <STRONG>Alasdair 
Morgan: Planning Application for an Extension of the Landfill Site at Aucheninnes, 
Kirkcudbrightshire</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive 
to hold a full public enquiry into the planning application which is now with 
it, lodged by Shanks Waste Management with Dumfries and Galloway Council, for 
the extension of the landfill site at Aucheninnes, Kirkcudbrightshire, given the 
application's potential detrimental environmental effects on the community of 
Dalbeattie.</P><P>Supported by: Michael Matheson, David Mundell<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Alex Fergusson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3717#</STRONG> <STRONG>Brian 
Fitzpatrick: Dialogues Project</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
all concerned on the launch of the Dialogues project by the University of Glasgow, 
which is designed to give about 200 small- and medium-sized west of Scotland businesses, 
including existing and new businesses, access to the expertise and knowledge base 
of the university; recognises the opportunity that this welcome initiative provides 
for pulling together key players in economic development, including Scottish Enterprise, 
local authorities, the NHS, the education sector and the private sector, and promoting 
joined-up thinking across the support networks; welcomes the funding support that 
has been made available from the University of Glasgow, Strathclyde European Partnership 
and Glasgow City Council and the collaborative working undertaken by Strathclyde 
University and the NHS on this project; notes the progress made since 1997 in 
translating research knowledge into commercial reality and in finding ways to 
develop innovations and discoveries here, rather than simply seeking opportunities 
overseas; encourages further progress in supporting research activity and commercialisation 
to help Scottish businesses and the business base of our universities grow, and 
believes that the Scottish Executive should give early consideration to securing 
comprehensive baseline data information about the commercial outputs being generated 
from research conducted in Scottish universities and research institutes to enable 
better target setting and performance evaluation and thereby influence future 
commercialisation strategies. </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3715#</STRONG> <STRONG>Robin 
Harper: Theatre in Scotland</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament regrets the lack 
of sufficient funding for Scottish theatre; notes the cutbacks at Brunton Theatre; 
notes the contribution made over the years by groups such as the TAG Theatre Company, 
7:84, Borderline, Theatre in Education and TWE Edinburgh; further notes the looming 
funding crisis for repertory theatre, especially the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh; 
notes that unless funding equivalent to the funding available to theatre in England 
and Wales is made available, there will be a drift of talent southwards that will 
result in the ability of professional theatre to survive in Scotland being undermined 
in the near future, and believes that the Scottish Executive should redress this 
imbalance as soon as possible by providing sufficient funds to the Scottish Arts 
Council to accomplish this.<STRONG><em> R</em></STRONG></P><P>Supported by: Tommy 
Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3714</STRONG> <STRONG>Johann Lamont: Glasgow: European 
City of Sport 2003</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow on 
receiving the title of European City of Sport 2003 and considers that this honour 
should be taken into account in the decision on the siting of the new national 
sports stadium.</P><P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3713#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Shona Robison: Records of Property Ownership</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes that many communal properties in the ownership of private landlords receive 
no maintenance and little repair; recognises that these properties blight surrounding 
areas; acknowledges the good work of local councils in trying to enforce repair 
works, and believes that the Scottish Executive should assist local councils in 
this work by making records of property ownership readily available to them.</P><P>Supported 
by: Michael Matheson, Alex Neil</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3712</STRONG> <STRONG>Tavish 
Scott: Scotland's Fishing Communities</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">notes 
with concern the open letter to fishermen from European Commissioner Franz Fischler 
issued last week; challenges his statement that the European Union would not be 
forcing anyone to scrap their boats or to give up fishing if the European Commission&#146;s 
recommended white fish total allowable catches were accepted by the Fisheries 
Council; notes with dismay the implication that Mr Fischler is using the lure 
of fleet subsidies to win support from southern EU member states when expansion 
of their fleets is inappropriate in the current circumstances; reaffirms its full 
support for Scotland&#146;s fishing communities, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
to continue to give its full backing to the Scottish white fish industry.</A></P><P>Supported
