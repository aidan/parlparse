<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-103</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Grampian Police Pipe Band Centenary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Grampian Police Pipe Band which celebrates its centenary in 2007; salutes the band&rsquo;s participation in many local and international events, and acknowledges that pipe bands are international ambassadors of this country, create opportunities to cultivate musical talents among young people and form an important part of Scotland&rsquo;s modern culture.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-102#</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>30th Anniversaries of Maryhill Housing Association and Queens Cross Housing Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vital contribution made in the last 30 years to the regeneration of Maryhill by both Maryhill Housing Association and Queens Cross Housing Association and congratulates both organisations on their shared anniversary; recognises the efforts of the lay members and staff of these organisations and the contribution that they have made over the last 30 years, and also recognises that, working with other stakeholders, they have ensured that housing in their areas has been greatly improved while their wider action programmes have helped to create not just good homes but safe, vibrant and confident communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-101</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Planning for Further Extensions to the Route of the Borders Railway</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament reaffirms its support for the construction of the Borders railway; recalls the support of the Parliament to restore the rail line as a dual and single track rail line from Edinburgh Waverley to Tweedbank with stations in Midlothian and the Borders; further recalls the funding commitment of the Scottish Executive in 2005 which has been reaffirmed; welcomes the transfer of the delivery of the project from the Waverley Railway Partnership to Transport Scotland; believes that the scheme is enhanced by the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link; is concerned that the SNP in the south of Scotland has stated that the rail project is under threat if the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link scheme approved by the Parliament proceeds, and believes that the Executive should, without delay, build the Borders railway and start planning the further extensions to the route to Hawick and subsequently beyond.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Hume<strong>*</strong>, Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-100</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Football in Dundee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and the Scottish Football League (SFL) appear to be unwilling to do anything to help Dundee FC and Dundee United FC avoid fixture clashes next season and supports the efforts of Dundee FC in lobbying the SPL and SFL to change their minds; further notes that Tayside Police has advised that having two fixtures over a single weekend stretches its resources and supports its efforts in lobbying the SPL and the SFL; believes that it would be in the interests of Scottish football for the SPL and SFL to engage in constructive dialogue on this and other matters, and calls on the Scottish Government to lobby the two organisations to ensure that common sense prevails.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-99</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Darfur and Chad: Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern the ongoing crisis in Darfur and Chad which has affected 4.5 million people, almost equivalent to the population of Scotland, that more than 2 million people in Darfur have been forced to flee for their lives into camps due to the conflict, that 4 million people in Darfur are dependent on humanitarian aid for survival and that nearly 250,000 refugees have fled from Darfur into Chad since the crisis began in 2003; further notes that the looming rainy season heightens the risk of deadly conditions like diarrhoea and malaria, and supports the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal in order to save lives in Darfur and Chad, to raise much-needed funds to help people affected by the conflict, giving shelter, clean water and sanitation, emergency food and vital items such as water buckets, blankets and soap and enable medical teams to provide emergency care.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-98</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Education Authorities Inspection Report on Schools in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the conclusions of the second education authorities inspection report on schools in Aberdeen which reveals a number of deficiencies in the provision of primary and secondary education in Aberdeen under previous council administrations, such as a dramatic increase in the number of exclusions and a general failure to support pupils with behavioural and emotional difficulties; also notes with concern that the report identifies a widening gulf between the academic achievements of pupils from schools in affluent areas and areas of greater social need; recognises that, although this report is highly critical, Aberdeen City Council has already taken great steps to address the main points for action, and wishes it well in its endeavours.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-97#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Beauly Denny Public Inquiry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the conduct of the public inquiry into the proposed Beauly to Denny 400kV electricity transmission line; notes that there is a lack of confidence from many objectors in the current handling of the inquiry and that objectors have raised concerns with Inquiry Reporters but that these concerns have been dismissed; further notes with concern that many objectors&rsquo; submissions have been ruled inadmissible; believes that serious issues are not being fully considered due to the strict adherence to the inquiry timetable, and further believes that the current conduct of the public inquiry will prevent a fully democratic inquiry and does nothing to reassure the 17,000 objectors that this is a fair process.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-93.1</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Abolition of Bridge Tolls</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-93) in the name of Stewart Stevenson, leave out from &quot;who&quot; to end and insert &quot;in Edinburgh, Dundee and Fife and, in the interests of reducing the impact of increasing traffic on the Forth and Tay road bridges and reducing congestion, supports the introduction of revenue-neutral smart charges with higher charges at peak times for cars on a sliding scale according to occupancy rates, lower charges or free access at other times of the day and week and free access for public transport at all times.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-93.2</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Abolition of Bridge Tolls</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-93) in the name of Stewart Stevenson, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;, in accepting that the people of Fife and Tayside should not be disadvantaged by the retention of tolls on the Forth and Tay road bridges, requires that consultation aimed at bringing forward proposals leading to the removal of the tolls as soon as practicable also ensures that traffic management and safety issues on the Forth road bridge are dealt with and that any employees affected are treated with dignity and respect; further requires that the government&rsquo;s proposals set out clearly what the financial consequences of the removal of tolls on the transport budget are and outline funding options for the vital replacement Forth crossing, and requires that, as any additional vehicle traffic increases congestion problems in Edinburgh and the wider region, existing commitments to trams and Edinburgh Airport Rail which have already been scrutinised and received parliamentary approval should not be arbitrarily delayed or cancelled and that all future major transport project proposals be properly costed, evaluated and prioritised.&quot;</p>
