<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2637</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>The Clackmannanshire Bridge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision that the new upper Forth crossing will be called the Clackmannanshire Bridge; recognises and applauds the huge efforts put in by the county&rsquo;s residents, voluntary groups, elected representatives and local newspapers to campaign for this name to be chosen, and believes that the increased recognition of Clackmannanshire that this naming will bring will mean tangible benefits, putting the Wee County on the map in a big way.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2635.1</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Scudamore Report into Foot and Mouth Disease</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2635) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;notes the continued economic impact of the outbreak on Scotland&rsquo;s beef, sheep and pig farmers, and calls on the Scottish Government to address proactively the continuing decline in livestock numbers across Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2635.2</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Scudamore Report into Foot and Mouth Disease</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2635) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;believes that, although the devolution settlement has largely been a success for Scottish agriculture, the current position whereby Scotland decides on animal health policy but has no control over its funding is an anomaly of the Scotland Act 1998, which is detrimental to relationships between the two administrations, and calls on the Scottish Government to press the case for devolving a proportionate share of the animal health budget currently held at Westminster to Scotland, while preserving the right to access the UK Treasury reserve fund.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2635.3</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Scudamore Report into Foot and Mouth Disease</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2635) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;to minimise&quot; to end and insert &quot;such as the role that local abattoirs might play and the unique circumstances of Scotland&rsquo;s islands; notes however the continuing difficulties experienced by the pig industry, and calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent action to support the Scottish pig industry and to consider further action to minimise the potential future disruption to the Scottish livestock industry.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2631.2</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Local Government Finance</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2631) in the name of Derek Brownlee, insert at end &quot;and believes the UK Government should agree that Council Tax Benefit money forms an integral part of local government finance and should be available to local government as part of decisions by the Scottish Parliament to reform local taxation in Scotland.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2629.1</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Age Limits on Purchases of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2629) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;rejects&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the period of consultation, listening and debate that is happening in Scotland on how to rebalance the country&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol; welcomes the initiatives being taken at local level, including voluntary agreements not to sell alcohol to persons under 21; notes the ongoing work done by licensing boards and other partners to implement the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005; recognises the need to build on that legislation with further measures including the ending of irresponsible alcohol promotions, and acknowledges that given the major public health implications failure to take further action to tackle alcohol misuse is not an option.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-2621</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Ending the Shame of Child Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with alarm statistics produced by the Campaign to End Child Poverty that show that Glasgow has the worst levels of child poverty in Scotland including large areas, such as Glasgow North East where 73% of children - 12,010 out of 16,435 - come from families that are either workless or in receipt of working tax credit, and smaller clusters, such as in north Barlanark and Easterhouse south where the proportion in workless families or in families on working tax credit is 98%; supports those involved in the United Kingdom&rsquo;s biggest ever event to end child poverty, at Trafalgar Square on Saturday 4 October 2008; further supports the call of the organisers of the march for the UK Government to spend just &pound;3 billion a year to reach its own target to halve child poverty by 2010 and stay on course to end child poverty altogether; believes that all governments and administrations in the UK should work positively together in order to address child poverty issues; acknowledges that this can mean different approaches and strategies within different areas of the UK, and further believes that an excellent example of this is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach, including moves to abolish prescription charges, extend entitlement to free school meals and school clothing grants, the freezing of the council tax and the introduction of direct payments to kinship carers of looked-after children.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2621.1</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Ending the Shame of Child Poverty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2621) in the name of Bob Doris, leave out from &quot;the worst levels&quot; to end and insert &quot;some of the worst levels of child poverty in Scotland; therefore welcomes the findings of the most recent National Statistics publication of <em>Scottish Households Below Average Income</em>, which shows a marked decline between 1999 and 2007 in the number of Scottish households in both absolute and relative poverty, including a 28% decrease in relative child poverty and a 61% decrease in absolute child poverty, meaning that the previous administration&rsquo;s target to halve absolute child poverty by 2010 was being met significantly ahead of schedule; believes that this progress would not have been possible without many of the initiatives by the previous administration and the UK Government, including the Sure Start programme, record increases in child benefit, the working families tax credit, child tax credit and the national minimum wage, the latter of which was finally passed in the House of Commons without the support of a single SNP MP; also believes that, despite SNP MSP&rsquo;s rhetoric, freezing council tax and abolishing prescription charges by 2011 does absolutely nothing to assist those on the lowest incomes given that they are already exempt; considers that after nearly 18 months in government, the SNP is yet to fulfil its pledge to introduce direct payments to kinship carers of looked-after children and that its budget, passed with the support of the Conservatives, is in fact precipitating cuts to a range of local services including school meals provision and to a host of voluntary organisations providing services affecting some of Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable children, and further believes that this threatens much of the progress made during the past decade in tackling child poverty as well as seriously undermining the SNP&rsquo;s credibility on these matters.&quot;</p>
