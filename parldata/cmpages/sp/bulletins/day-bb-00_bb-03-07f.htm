    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-639</b> <strong>Bruce Crawford: Water Charges</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament believes that the impending rise in water charges which have been approved by
    the Scottish Executive is as unacceptable and damaging as the rises in the local authority
    council tax forced on local authorities by the Executive&#146;s inadequate local
    government financial settlement; notes that the Executive is failing to make any financial
    contribution to the maintenance of adequate standards in the water industry just as it is
    failing to adequately support essential local government services; calls for the increases
    in water charges to be kept to a minimum and for measures to be taken to avoid consumers
    being forced to pay the cost of past neglect of the industry including a review of
    external finance limits, the scrapping of the Private Finance Initiative and the
    cancelling of debt in the industry to avoid unnecessary and unfair increases in water
    bills, and condemns the apparent indifference of the Executive to the rise in water bills,
    the increase in council tax and the cutting of local government services particularly with
    regard to their impact on the most vulnerable in society.</p>

    Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Mr Duncan Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>,

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-638</b> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Role of Post Offices</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes the important role played by post offices and sub-post offices in the
    economic and social fabric of many of our communities and notes with concern proposals
    from Her Majesty&#146;s Government to change the method of benefit payments (Automated
    Credit Transfer Scheme to banks) which could result in the closure of sub-post offices and
    the impact this could have on the social inclusion targets of the Scottish Executive;
    further notes that recent announcements to allow some cash payments to continue to be paid
    from post offices will be too little too late to alleviate this serious situation, and
    therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations on this issue
    to Her Majesty&#146;s Government in order to defend the interests of our urban and rural
    communities and urges it to be proactive in making representations to other relevant
    agencies to ensure the continuance and development of post offices in Scotland and the
    improvement of the availability of financial services in poorer communities in Scotland.</p>

    Street Halls, a well used and much loved day centre facility used by over 1700 pensioners.</p>
