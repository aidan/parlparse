<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;
  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5368#</strong> <strong>Paul Martin:</strong> <strong>Dennistoun Dispersal Order</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of the dispersal order in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow; notes that the dispersal order has been widely welcomed by residents who live in the Dennistoun area; recognises the importance of ensuring that the legal remedies provided by the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 are enforced; congratulates Strathclyde Police E Division on its commitment to ensuring that the dispersal order introduced on 13 October 2006 is a success, and believes that steps should be taken to ensure that a comprehensive exit plan is in place after the dispersal notice expires, that there is a local plan to ensure that local youth diversionary activities are in place and that an independent evaluation is carried out.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5367</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>My Money is as Good as Yours</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing number of establishments in England that are refusing to accept Scottish banknotes, viewing this form of discrimination as something which calls into question the benefits Scotland receives from being part of the United Kingdom; expresses continuing bemusement that Scottish banknotes are not legal tender in either Scotland or the rest of the UK, while the only legal tender are coins from the Royal Mint and some of these are subject to limitations, for example &pound;1 worth of 1p coins is legal tender but &pound;1.01 is not and &pound;1 and &pound;2 coins are legal tender in Scotland to an unlimited amount; notes that all money, whether printed in Glasgow or London, is subject to the same requirement to carrying a promise to pay the bearer the value of the note, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland to change Schedule 5, Part II, A1 of the Scotland Act 1998, which states that the issue and circulation of money is a reserved matter and therefore that the Scottish Parliament has no powers to alter the legal position of Scottish banknotes, thus ending this queer and somewhat confusing situation.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5366#</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Nominated Neighbour Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the risk to older and vulnerable householders from bogus callers; congratulates Fife Community Safety Partnership for its innovative and highly successful Nominated Neighbour Scheme; notes that, during the pilot project for this scheme in Glenrothes in Central Fife, there were no incidences of bogus callers reported to Fife Constabulary; further notes that the scheme is cheap and simple to operate; welcomes the bond that is created between neighbours by the Nominated Neighbour Scheme; believes that schemes such as this and other similar neighbour protection schemes engender a feeling of security and safety among older and vulnerable householders, which in turn leads to less stress and anxiety; pays tribute to all those who participate in community safety partnerships and panels across Central Fife and Scotland, and welcomes the funding from the Scottish Executive, local authorities and other sources which make such schemes possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5365</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Death Threats to Colombian Trade Unionists</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with grave concern a communiqu&eacute; issued on 14 December 2006 in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia, to Mr Euripides Yance, a Coca-Cola worker and member of the national committee of Sinaltrainal trade union, and Messrs Limberto Carranza and Campo Quintero among others; notes that this communiqu&eacute; is essentially a death threat to various student, social and trade union leaders if they do not leave the city within a week; remembers that Mr Yance visited the Parliament in 2005 as part of a UK tour organised in solidarity with Sinaltrainal members to alert parliamentarians to the dire state of human rights in his country and the persecution of militant trade unionists, student leaders and human rights defenders; further notes that this death threat occurred just days after Colombia&rsquo;s Vice-President Francisco Santos made a public declaration referring to what he described as campaigns to discredit Coca Cola, Nestl&eacute; and other private corporations and contended that they are pushed by &quot;sectors of the extreme left, radicals infiltrated into trade union sectors that are generating absolutely absurd campaigns against the corporations&quot;; further notes that these threats have occurred at the same time as the Sinaltrainal trade union is negotiating its demands in respect of the Coca-Cola bottling plants in Santander, the region in which Barranquilla is situated, and calls on the government of President Alvaro Uribe to ensure that the lives of Mr Yance and the other trade unionists are protected and an investigation into the facts of this communiqu&eacute; is carried out in order to ensure that its intellectual and material authors are brought to justice.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5364</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Acceptance of Scottish Banknotes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that London Underground ticket kiosk machines do not accept Scottish banknotes; notes that ticket machines can be reprogrammed to accept Scottish banknotes as the Parliament has done with its own cashless vending service, and calls on London Underground to reprogramme its ticketing machines to accept Scottish banknotes.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5363</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) and any charge or payment of a kind referred to in paragraph 4 of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>

<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5359&diams; </strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Cervical Cancer and the HPV Vaccine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the licensing of the first vaccine against strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV) responsible for around 70% of cases of cervical cancer; expresses its concern that, despite a 40-year history of cervical screening in the United Kingdom, almost 3,000 women are diagnosed and 1,000 women still die of cervical cancer each year in the UK; recognises that the vaccine will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer and that it is not known whether it will prevent cancer in women already infected with HPV; therefore believes that the cervical cancer screening programme should be continued and that further action should be taken to increase the take-up of screening in more deprived areas, among ethnic minority groups and among women with learning difficulties; further believes that this will improve early detection and allow earlier treatment of this disease; recognises the role of charities such as Jo&rsquo;s Trust, Cancerbackup and Cancer Research UK, amongst others, in supporting patients with cervical cancer and their families and in counselling the thousands more women who worry about their health following an abnormal smear result; recognises the huge potential benefits to be had through vaccination in East Renfrewshire and throughout Scotland from reducing the incidence of cervical cancer, reducing the number of colposcopies, reducing the number of abnormal smears and reducing the number of people requiring treatment for genital warts; further recognises the success of the Scottish Executive in its public health campaigns and cancer prevention strategies, and considers that ministers should put in place measures to raise awareness and to prepare for a vaccination programme.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5358</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Welcome Gas Rebate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Gas for extending its Winter Rebate programme to include an additional 100,000 vulnerable senior citizens and notes that this 33&#8531;% increase in the numbers who will benefit is an example to all other fuel suppliers and an excellent step forward by Scottish Gas who listened to the representations from the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party and gave this positive response.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5357</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Recognition and Support for Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and applauds the work undertaken in our society by Scotland&rsquo;s 480,000 unpaid carers; notes that the work of those carers contributes around &pound;5.3 billion worth of care, more than half of the entire budget of NHS Scotland; further notes that lack of support means that an increasing number of carers are forced to give up caring every year due to the detrimental effect caring has on their own health; acknowledges that one in five carers suffer from poor health and that carers are a third more likely to become permanently sick or disabled than people with no caring responsibilities; recognises that half of carers who provide substantial care have suffered a physical injury due to their caring role or have received treatment for anxiety, depression or mental ill-health; further notes that at least 17,000 carers are young people whose schooling and social life can be affected, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement fully the NHS Carer Information Strategies across Scotland to prevent today&rsquo;s carers from becoming tomorrow&rsquo;s patients.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5356</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Tartan Kilts Made by Scottish Companies for the Royal Regiment of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Royal Regiment of Scotland should use the highest quality woollen cloth for its tartan; is concerned that there is a shortage of kilts for the army at present; notes that EU rules insist on competitive international tendering for the supply of goods worth more than &pound;300,000, which could result in the cheapest and most inferior product being chosen, and calls on the Ministry of Defence to announce when the trialling of kilts for the Royal Regiment will end and to ensure that every consideration is given to the contract to supply kilts to the Royal Regiment of Scotland being kept in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5355.5</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5355) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;the publication&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the UK Government has initiated a debate on the future of the independent nuclear deterrent force and urges everyone in Scotland to take part in it; recognises that the decisions on national defence are rightly reserved to Westminster; considers that any government has a primary duty to protect the security of its people and that this includes a credible policy on national defence and international security; believes in a shared objective of a world without nuclear weapons and supports further reductions in the global nuclear arsenal; further believes that, in seeking a world free from nuclear weapons, we should utilise and develop our international engagement at every level including at the EU, the United Nations including the UK&rsquo;s seat on the Security Council, NATO and the G8; notes with concern the plans of the SNP to take Scotland out of the collective security arrangements of the UK and NATO and to establish separate armed forces for Scotland with greatly diminished capabilities either to contribute to international peacekeeping operations or even to defend Scottish interests, and rejects those policies on the grounds that they would threaten the security of Scotland, diminish our armed forces and destroy jobs.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5349.2</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Post Offices</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5349) in the name of Mr John Swinney, after second &quot;Government&quot; insert &quot;to begin paying post offices adequately for the government services they provide, to return services that it has withdrawn, such as issuing  television licenses, to post offices, to begin the development of post office accounts as a banking facility for those living in deprived and rural communities and to consider providing assistance to communities in deprived urban and rural areas to open community post offices to prevent the loss of vital local services, and thus.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5349.3</strong> <strong>Euan Robson:</strong> <strong>Post Offices</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5349) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the post office network plays a crucial role in Scotland; notes that this is a reserved issue and supports the Liberal Democrats&rsquo; rejection of the recommendation of the UK Government&rsquo;s post office network consultation paper that a further 2,500 post office branches be closed across the United Kingdom&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5349.4</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Post Offices</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5349) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that it is necessary to look carefully at the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals for the future of the post office network in full and the consultation paper itself to ensure that the special needs of Scotland&rsquo;s remoter communities are properly taken into account; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s proposal to apply four criteria to this assessment, namely whether there will be an acceptable level of future services, especially in remote rural and disadvantaged communities, whether there is a recognition that post offices do not occupy a purely commercial role in our communities, but have an important social role to play, whether there is proper consultation with affected local communities and whether there will be a continuation of Post Office efforts to promote innovative means of service delivery; believes that it is important that the vital social and economic role of post offices has been acknowledged; is pleased to see the commitment of &pound;1.7 billion to support the network and to pay for restructuring and that the annual social network payment will remain in place meantime, and is encouraged by the push for outreach locations for remote communities.&quot;</p>
