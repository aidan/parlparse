    Service Charges</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the review of Air Passenger Duty
    announced in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s pre-Budget Statement; further notes
    that air services both within and to the Highlands and Islands provide not only vital
    lifeline links but are central to the economic development of the area; supports an
    exemption for all flights from airports within the Highlands and Islands to all airports
    in the UK and calls on the Chancellor&#146;s review to examine also the detrimental effect
    current passenger service charges have on rural and island economies.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-441</b> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Commitment to Reducing Class Sizes</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament deplores the Scottish Executive&#145;s decision to break its commitment to
    spend savings from the abolition of the assisted places scheme on reducing class sizes;
    notes that these funds have instead been earmarked to fund rescue packages for Scottish
    Opera and the National Stadium project at Hampden, and believes that any savings within
    the arts and sports budgets or funding from the Executive&#146;s contingency provisions
    should have been utilised first.</p>

    an amendment to motion (S1M-437) in the name of Angus MacKay, leave out from
    &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;while welcoming the Executive&#146;s
    cross-cutting approach and the efforts being made to reverse the tragic level of drug
    deaths and drug misuse in Scotland, notes that the present framework for dealing with drug
    abuse is exceptionally bureaucratic and complicated and calls upon the Scottish Executive
    to appoint a Minister with sole responsibility for drugs within existing Ministerial
    numbers and budgets to help streamline this system, making it more easily understood and
    accessible to the people it seeks to serve.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-437.2</b> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Tackling Drug Misuse in Scotland</strong>&#151;As
    an amendment to motion (S1M-437) in the name of Angus MacKay, leave out from
    &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that there is neither a single
    drug problem nor a single solution; is concerned that at present there are insufficient
    resources available to those who desire to address the problems of addiction; welcomes the
    contribution which can be made to the debate by reference to international experience and,
    accepting that a cross-cutting approach is required to deal with the challenge posed to
    society by substance abuse, agrees to reflect that in the Parliament itself by the
    establishment of a Substance Misuse Strategy Committee which would facilitate the
    multi-agency debate required.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-437.3</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Tackling Drug Misuse in Scotland</strong>&#151;As
    an amendment to motion (S1M-437) in the name of Angus MacKay, leave out from
    &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets the current drugs policy which in
    1999 resulted in the highest number of heroin related deaths, the highest and most
    widespread level of heroin addiction and the worst level of drug related crime ever
    recorded in Scotland; supports an alternative policy based not on the failed policies of
    increased law enforcement and education based mainly on scare tactics, but on
    harm-reduction policies which would include &#150; (i) honest, realistic and constructive
    drugs education programmes formulated mainly by drugs workers and drug users; (ii) a range
    of approaches to heroin addiction, including the controlled prescription of pharmaceutical
    heroin to registered addicts in order to stabilise their lives and the lives of the
    communities they live in which would drastically reduce both drug-related deaths and
    drug-related crime; (iii) legalising the production and sale of cannabis through properly
    licensed and regulated premises to end the criminalisation of over one million cannabis
    users in Scotland as well as driving a clear wedge between the heroin and cannabis markets
    and (iv) the diversion of funds from the law enforcement budget to provide adequate
    resources for an integrated treatment, rehabilitation and education programme, and which
    is based on the best examples of integrated drugs policies endorsed and practised by
    European partners like Switzerland and Holland which have resulted in significant
    reductions in problematic drug use, and recognises that problematic drug use is mainly
    rooted in the social and economic conditions of poverty, lack of opportunity and poor
    recreational facilities which face so many of our young people and that tackling poverty
    is therefore essential to the success of this approach.</p>
