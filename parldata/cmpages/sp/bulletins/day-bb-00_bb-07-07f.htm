            in view of the present rundown in the oil fabrication industry, calls 
            upon the oil companies to establish clearly the likely future workload 
            for the rig fabrication yards in the UK, and Scotland in particular, 
            with a view to establishing a sustainable base for oil fabrication 
            and identifying where diversification away from fabrication will be 
            required, and further calls upon the oil companies to establish a 
            contingency fund, the Oil Rig Fabrication Communities Contingency 
            Fund, to help those leaving the industry or those no longer employed 
            in the industry to gain new skills, to provide support for the communities 
            who are hit hardest by the rundown and to help those yards with spare 
            capacity to diversify into other areas of engineering.</font></p>

            notes that, as a consequence of high taxation, the cost of providing 
            fuel for road haulage companies in Scotland is double that of our 
            European neighbours; notes that, as a consequence, the number of road 
            miles travelled by lorry has not been reduced, merely that Scottish 
            drivers and operators are being undercut and displaced by continental 
            drivers and operators, and that across Scotland the cost of goods 
            is rising to reflect increasing transport costs; further notes the 
            answer to question S1W-7586 by Sarah Boyack on 26 June 2000, indicating 
            that the Scottish Executive would carefully consider any proposals 
            by the Road Haulage Association for an essential user rebate; therefore 
            draws the attention of the Scottish Executive to the proposals published 
            by the Road Haulage Association for an essential user rebate for fuel 
            duty, a scheme which would ensure that on valid business journeys 
            the cost of fuel to Scottish operators was brought into line with 
            the cost of fuel to our nearest continental neighbours by rebating 
            the excess taxation charged here, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to publish a detailed consideration of the impacts and benefits of 
            such a scheme.</font></p>
