<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3033</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Agenda for Change Pay System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that at the end of October 2008 there were 1,991 substantive staff still to be assimilated to the Agenda for Change pay system and 12,598 bank staff in the same position; believes that reaching a conclusion on the banding of these staff is important in maintaining staff morale in the NHS, and calls on the Scottish Government to do all in its power to require NHS boards to tackle this issue with the greatest priority and to have completed the process for both substantive and bank staff by February 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3032</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>European Parliament&rsquo;s Climate Change Committee Recommendations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the final recommendations of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Climate Change for a future EU integrated policy on climate change, with the central goal of keeping the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius as well as meeting the long-term reduction target of at least 80% by 2050; further welcomes the recommendation that, in the next EU financial framework, the highest priority must be given to climate change and measures to combat it; notes that Scotland is a leading nation in Europe in setting ambitious national climate change targets, and welcomes the steps that the Scottish Government is taking to making Scotland the green capital of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3031</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Universal Declaration o Human Richts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by Amnesty International of a Scots language version of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in poster format, in time for its 60th Anniversary on 10 December 2008; believes this will help to promote awareness and understanding of both the human rights agenda and the importance of the Scots language; reaffirms its belief in the declaration&rsquo;s opening statement that &quot;All human beings born free and equal in dignity and rights&quot;, which translates as &quot;Aw human sowels is born free and equal in dignity and richts&quot;; notes that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is one of the most translated documents in history and welcomes the Scots and Gaelic translations of it, and further reaffirms its commitment to and respect for fundamental human rights, irrespective of language or any other distinction.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3030</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations Glenrothes - Britain in Bloom</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glenrothes on being nominated to represent Scotland in the large town category at the 2009 Britain in Bloom awards; wishes the town well for the finals of the competition, competing against rival towns from across the United Kingdom; notes that this follows Glenrothes being voted the most clean, sustainable and beautiful town in Scotland in the 2008 Beautiful Scotland campaign; congratulates members of the community who have worked hard for this award and particularly parks staff at Fife Council, and believes that the award is a great honour for Glenrothes as it celebrates its 60th anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3029</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Scottish Parliamentary Pensions Bill be passed.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3028</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>The May Day Network</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Business in the Community for the part that it is playing in the setting up of the May Day Network and the Climate Change Business Delivery Group; recognises that the May Day Network is designed to encourage companies to make a pledge to monitor, report and cut their carbon emissions and help companies progress towards a low-carbon model; further recognises that the May Day Network now has over 1,300 members across the United Kingdom, with all members having committed to tackling climate change by pledging to take one or more of the following six actions - calculating their carbon footprint, reporting their carbon footprint publicly, setting an absolute emissions reduction target and taking action to meet it, encouraging employees to reduce their carbon footprint at home and work, mobilising customers to take action and working in partnership with suppliers to reduce emissions in the supply chain, and calls on the Scottish Government to demonstrate its environmental leadership by requiring all public sector organisations also to commit to taking all six of these same actions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3027</strong> <strong>Angela Constance:</strong> <strong>16 Days of Activism to Challenge Violence Against Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the global 16 days of activism to tackle violence against women; welcomes the demonstration organised outside the Parliament by Amnesty International and Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid (SWA) on 4 December 2008; recognises that gender-based violence is a fundamental abuse of human rights; supports the calls by Amnesty International UK (AIUK) and SWA for women with &quot;no recourse to public funds&quot; (NRPF) to have the same rights to access refuge and services as domiciled Scots women and children when fleeing violence; notes that the NRPF rule applies to women with insecure immigration status; recognises that this includes women with spouse visas, work visas, student visas and other temporary visas, and women who have been illegally trafficked, as well as women who have overstayed their visa; accepts the research undertaken by AIUK and SWA that found that women subject to the NRPF rule find it almost impossible to secure places of safety because they usually leave a violent situation with nothing and find that they cannot claim the required benefits that fund accommodation and support; notes that only 24% of women seeking refuge between 2007 and 2008 who are subject to the NRPF rule were accommodated; is concerned that some local authorities will provide support to children only, which would separate children from their mothers; calls on the short-life working group on this issue to report back to the Parliament; supports the calls by SWA and AIUK for the Scottish Government to make available immediate emergency funding to help women in Scotland until a permanent solution is in place and to ensure that the needs of women subject to the NRPF rule are addressed in the strategic framework on violence against women, and urges the Home Office to exempt women fleeing violence from the NRPF rule.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3026</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Calman Threat to Students in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the views expressed on university and student funding in the first report of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution that &quot;further devolution would almost certainly affect the functioning of the UK as a single social unit&quot; and its invitation of further views on the policy context of higher education; is concerned by the clear implication that differing systems in this area are damaging and should be avoided; welcomes the positive dialogue existing between the Scottish Government and Scottish university principals; notes, by contrast, the introduction by the UK Government of &pound;3,000 per year top-up fees and much higher levels of state-sanctioned student indebtedness to fund higher education; considers the Calman position to pose a direct threat to students at Scottish universities, and believes firmly that the Parliament should continue to have responsibility for the funding of universities and student support.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3025</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Increased Vulnerability of Homeowners to Reposession</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the increased vulnerability of homeowners to repossession, particularly those with mortgages from sub-prime lenders; notes with deep concern that Scottish households currently have less protection from repossession than people elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and calls on ministers to act on the recommendations of organisations involved in debt management, and the joint statement by spokespeople from the Scottish Labour Party, Scottish Liberal Democrats, Scottish Green Party and Margo Macdonald MSP, by facilitating the introduction of a Scottish equivalent to the pre-court protocol introduced in England to place an enforceable duty on both lenders and courts to ensure that repossession is genuinely a last resort, to introduce licensing of sale and lease-back schemes and to provide vulnerable families facing repossession with an automatic right to legal aid.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3023</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Isle of Barra, Scottish and UK Calor Village of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Barra community on winning both the Scottish Calor Village of the Year title and also the inaugural UK Calor Village of the Year award; commends the work of those campaigners who have brought welcome and deserved plaudits for the island, and recognises the efforts of the community in the initiatives that secured these achievements and will benefit the wider community socially, economically and environmentally for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3022</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>European Parliament Committee&rsquo;s Concern at Human Rights Abuses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament shares the concern expressed by the European Parliament&rsquo;s Civil Liberties Committee that there has been a high number of fundamental rights violations in the European Union in recent years, including instances of serious discrimination against minorities and threats to privacy; notes the committee&rsquo;s concern that its previous recommendations on CIA activities in the EU have not been implemented, and calls on EU institutions and members states to redouble their efforts to ensure that the fundamental human rights of people living in the EU are respected and upheld at all times.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3021</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>One Third of People in Scotland Defined as Breadline Poor</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern findings by a BBC investigation that almost a third of people in Scotland can be classified as &quot;breadline poor&quot;, defined as a poverty line so low that people are excluded from participating in the norms of society; believes that the existence of such poverty, at any level, in modern Scotland, is a scandal; further notes that the powers over welfare and taxation, which could tackle the root causes of poverty, remain reserved to Westminster, and that the interim report of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution has ruled out devolving such fiscal powers to the Scottish Parliament, and further believes that only independence will therefore equip the Scottish Government with the powers it needs to finally end extreme poverty and deprivation in Scotland.</p>
