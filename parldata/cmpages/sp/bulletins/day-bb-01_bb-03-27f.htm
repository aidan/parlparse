            <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Tourism and the Economy</strong>—That the Parliament 
            notes the grave impact which the foot-and-mouth crisis is having on 
            the tourism industry; believes that conflicting information about 
            the disease, both at home and abroad, further jeopardises Scottish 
            tourism; further believes that more must be done to secure the future 
            of the tourism industry, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to implement the following recovery plan: (i) immediate action to 
            enable and ensure efficient crisis management, including a public 
            information campaign through the press and broadcast media to make 
            people aware of what can and cannot be done during the crisis, (ii) 
            interim support measures to prevent bankruptcy throughout the duration 
            of the crisis including a rates relief package for the months of April, 
            May and June, interest free loans for affected industries and an exemption 
            to be sought by the Scottish Executive from Her Majesty's Treasury 
            for VAT and National Insurance contributions over a similar period 
            for crisis-affected industries, and (iii) a recovery strategy to ensure 
            the success of the summer tourist season, beginning immediately and 
            including an emergency Scottish advertising campaign in all key markets.

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1796</strong> 
            <strong>Brian Adam: Hepatitis C Compensation</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes 
            the decision of the High Court in England to award compensation to 
            patients across England who were infected with Hepatitis C due to 
            contaminated blood products and calls on the Scottish Executive to 
            review its decision to refuse compensation to patients with haemophilia 
            who contracted Hepatitis C through contaminated blood products.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Armed Forces Bill - UK Legislation</strong>—That the 
            Parliament agrees the principles contained in the provisions of the 
            Armed Forces Bill as they relate to the Ministry of Defence Police 
            in Scotland and that the Scottish Ministers should consent to the 
            measures on jurisdiction being commenced in Scotland, and agrees that 
            the relevant provisions to achieve these ends in the Bill should be 
            considered by the UK Parliament.</font></p>

            <strong>Andrew Wilson: Financial Powers of the Parliament</strong>—That the 
            Parliament notes that the current devolution settlement gives the 
            Scottish Parliament fewer financial powers than any other Parliament 
            in the world; further notes that, while devolution is a recognition 
            of the need for and desirability of policy divergences within the 
            United Kingdom, the financial settlement underpinning it is designed 
            explicitly to produce convergence in public expenditure; recognises 
            that two thirds of Scots already support the devolution of full financial 
            powers to the Scottish Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to respond to this growing consensus and bring forward proposals to 
            deliver full financial powers to the Parliament.</font></p>

            <strong>Brian Adam: Disposal of Animal Remains from Foot and Mouth Culling 
            Programme</strong>—That the Parliament expresses concern that waste disposal 
            companies operating in the north east of Scotland have been approached 
            to bury potentially contaminated waste from foot-and-mouth suspected 
            animals in landfill sites and calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
            ensure that such waste is not disposed of in areas currently unaffected 
            by the disease and that transportation of this waste is kept to the 
            minimum.</font></p>

            <strong>Pauline McNeill: Use of Webcams at Royal Hospital for Sick Children, 
            Yorkhill</strong>—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow City Council's 
            hospital learning service on introducing webcams to link children 
            in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill in Glasgow to 
            their teachers and classmates and commends this hi-tech pilot project 
            as an innovative development in using modern technology to allow sick 
            children to continue their learning with as little interruption as 
            possible and assist children who are long-term patients in feeling 
            less isolated.</font></p>

            <strong>John Scott: The Work of the Hannah Research Institute</strong>—That 
            the Parliament recognises the important contribution made by the Hannah 
            Research Institute, Ayr, to the study of biology and lactation, the 
            inter-relationships between mother and offspring, and the physical 
            and biological properties of milk and dairy-based products that are 
            related to food quality and safety; further recognises the key work 
            undertaken by the Institute’s Food Innovation Centre, particularly 
            in the light of its work to assist food producers and processors during 
            the current crisis they are facing; further recognises the Institute’s 
            vital contribution to the Ayrshire economy, and urges the Scottish 
            Executive to maintain its support for the Institute and encourage 
            its expansion with a view to the creation of a large-scale science 
            park in the West of Scotland. </font></p>
          <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1790</strong> 
            <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Definition of Rape</strong>—That the Parliament believes 
            that the ruling given by Lord Abernethy that to have sexual intercourse 
            with a women without her consent does not in itself constitute rape 
            is wholly unacceptable; finds it perverse that it has been suggested 
            that physical injury has to have taken place before an attack can 
            be defined as a rape; believes that when a person says no to sex and 
            these wishes are ignored that this constitutes rape in the eyes of 
            the victim and should also constitute rape in the eyes of the law, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive to re-examine the legal definition 
            of rape and to change the law accordingly. </font></p>

            <strong>Johann Lamont: Lord Abernethy ruling on rape</strong>—That the Parliament 
            notes with grave concern the recent ruling by Lord Abernethy that 
            sex without a women’s consent is not rape unless the attacker uses 
            force or the threat of force; believes that women have the right to 
            be protected in law from those who seek to have sex with them without 
            their consent; believes that there are serious ramifications in such 
            a ruling for the willingness of rape victims to report the crime and 
            on the attitudes of men who abuse or seek to abuse women; considers 
            that this ruling raises significant issues about the current training 
            for judges dealing with such cases, and, given the Scottish Executive’s 
            commitment to the zero tolerance of violence to women and its commitment 
            to the support of the victims of crime, urges the Minister for Justice 
            and the Minister for Social Justice, in conjunction with the Executive’s 
            equality unit, the appropriate committees of the Parliament and in 
            consultation in particular with women’s organisations and victim support 
            groups, to review the legislation on sexual assault and rape in order 
            to ensure that the law offers real protection and support to anyone 
            who suffers sexual assault or rape.</font></p>
