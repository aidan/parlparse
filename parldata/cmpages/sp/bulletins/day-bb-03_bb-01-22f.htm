Godman: The Widening Pay Gap Between Men and Women</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
views with concern the widening pay gap between men and women; believes that the 
overwhelming majority of Scots will share this opinion; urges all employers in 
all industries and throughout public services to reassess their pay systems to 
ensure that female employees are not being discriminated against in relation to 
their male colleagues, and considers that the Scottish Executive should do all 
in its power to challenge the discrimination and prejudice suffered by many women 
in their terms and conditions of employment and where promotional opportunities 
are denied to them.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3783#</STRONG> <STRONG>Christine Grahame: 
Litter Louts</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the concerns of many people 
regarding the blight of litter in towns, the countryside and on the seashore, 
illustrated in the correspondence from pupils at Chirnside Primary School, Duns, 
which highlighted the increased risk of accidents to children, pets and livestock 
as a consequence of, for example, broken glass and discarded polythene bags; notes 
that traffic accidents can arise if drivers take avoidance measures when confronted 
with debris on our roadways and motorways and that the effect on tourism and its 
consequences to the local and national economy can only be deleterious; further 
notes that the pupils drew attention to the lack of litter bins, the impact of 
fast food outlets, the cut in refuse collections and the culture of disregard 
for the environment and that it may even be regarded by some as "cool" to throw 
away litter, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should consider 
the following measures: (a) providing education from an early age with accompanying 
publicity to bring about a culture change of regard for our environment and bring 
us into line with our European neighbours, (b) endorsing stiffer fines and penalties 
for litter louts, including community service in clearing litter, (c) being more 
committed to recycling and providing more assistance to local authorities who 
have a track record in recycling provision, (d) considering measures, including 
legislation, to make it mandatory that fast food outlets clear litter from their 
environs and (e) commissioning a questionnaire for tourists to ascertain their 
views on the cleanliness or otherwise of our towns, countryside and seashore.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3782
