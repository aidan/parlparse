<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1883</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>No to Nestl&eacute;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision to award the contract for Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities&rsquo; bottled water to Nestl&eacute;; considers this decision to be, at the very least, misguided given Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s previous involvement in a number of aggressive marketing campaigns to promote formula milk; notes that Nestl&eacute; utilises marketing practices which appear to be in direct violation of the WHO/UNICEF International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes; further notes Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s powerful influence over market trends, governments and other companies, culminating in the adoption of questionable marketing practices which could weaken legislation designed to protect infant health; views with interest report findings published by International Baby Food Action Network which shows Nestl&eacute; to be the largest single source of violation of the marketing code worldwide, and calls for an obligation to be placed on local authorities to thoroughly research companies to ensure that a positive ethical choice is made when spending taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1882</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Prestwick International Airport - Best Cargo Airport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds Glasgow Prestwick International Airport on being named Best Cargo Airport at the 25th Air Cargo News Awards; notes that the airport handles on average 20 Boeing 747 freighters each week and continues to improve its freight development month on month, and commends the management and workforce of Glasgow Prestwick International Airport for their efforts which have resulted in this award.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1881</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>The National Game on Terrestrial Television</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the new findings of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission that there is an overwhelming 96% public support for Scotland&rsquo;s international football matches being shown on free-to-air terrestrial television from among those interested in football and even 70% support from those who would not watch it; recognises that only one-third of households have access to subscription TV services; supports the right of the entire Scottish public to see the national team playing the national sport, and reiterates calls for this to take place, either through successful and wholehearted bidding by terrestrial broadcasters or through the exercise of government powers to reserve Scotland matches exclusively for terrestrial television.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1880</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>The BBC&rsquo;s Attack on Venezuela</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the clear implication of the BBC&rsquo;s words on page 28 of the May/June issue of its magazine, <em>World Agenda</em>, that, with regard to human rights and democracy, Venezuela is comparable to Burma and Iran; notes that Venezuela continues to improve the welfare of its people, particularly in terms of combating poverty and illiteracy, raising pensions and improving healthcare; considers that Venezuela, since Hugo Ch&aacute;vez&rsquo;s election in 1998 and with the exception of the short-lived US-backed coup, has an excellent track record with regard to democracy as evidenced by the fact that Ch&aacute;vez not only won 11 national votes in nine years and that all elections have been described by international monitors as free and fair, but also by the fact that he respected the electorate&rsquo;s recent narrow rejection of a proposed new constitution; believes that the independent Latinobar&oacute;metro report on Latin American countries demonstrates that Venezuelans have an overwhelmingly positive view of their democracy and great confidence in their government and president, and accordingly calls on the BBC to justify its categorisation of Venezuela alongside Burma and Iran and, if it is unable to do so, to retract its words and offer an unequivocal apology to the government and people of Venezuela whose integrity it has called into question.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1865&diams;</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>A Tenancy Deposit Protection Scheme for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the withholding of deposits unreasonably continues to be a problem for tenants in the private rented sector; notes that the private rented sector provides over 230,000 homes to households in Scotland, some 8% of all households, including families, students, migrant workers and young professionals; further notes that many tenants, on leaving a tenancy, rely on the return of their deposit to pay the upfront deposit and rent for their new property and that withholding a deposit unfairly can lead to hardship, debt and ultimately homelessness; highlights recent research by St Andrew&rsquo;s University Student Union that found that 24% of students there have had unjustified deductions made from their deposits and 28% have faced unreasonable delays of more than 28 days in returning their deposits; acknowledges the successful introduction of the tenancy deposit protection scheme in operation in England and Wales which ensures protection for both landlords and tenants, and believes that powers already on statute in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 could be used to further a deposit protection scheme for Scotland, building on landlord registration and accreditation initiatives already in place.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1864</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Keep INTO Out</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed introduction of private company, INTO, to deliver core education provision at Glasgow Caledonian University; considers that privatisation of this provision would undoubtedly be detrimental to the quality of service delivery as it is unlikely to be of the same quality as mainstream provision; acknowledges the impact on terms and conditions of staff employed by private companies like INTO which is likely to reduce their morale and ultimately impact on the quality of the learning experience of students; notes that Glasgow Caledonian University is a publicly funded institution and is therefore accountable for how it uses its public funds; recognises the obligation of Scottish universities to remain active in the recruitment of international students unable to access appropriate education in their native countries and therefore accepts the need to provide a consistently superior service that is not subject to market demands; notes that education is far too important to be trusted to market forces, and believes that the introduction of the private sector in such a sensitive area of educational provision is clearly dangerous and must be resisted.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1856</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Possible Replacement of Disability Living Allowance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the present system of payment of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which provides money to disabled people based on the severity of their impairment rather than on the level of their income, should continue; deprecates UK Government proposals to remove this money from disabled people in order to support the implementation of &quot;individualised budgets&quot; as this would lead to uncertainty with regard to the level of individual budgets provided, to a loss of portability of the benefit and to the introduction of stigmatising means-testing, and accordingly asks for immediate discussions to take place between Scottish and UK ministers on this proposal, which has significant implications for issues of devolved responsibility, and for the outcome of these discussions to be brought before the Parliament and into the public arena.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1843</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Housing Association and Second Stage Transfers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Stock Valuation Study on Secondary Stock Transfer by Glasgow Housing Association (GHA), produced by Mazars LLP; notes that second stage transfers have been publicly stated to be a priority for GHA and the Scottish Government; notes that the Mazars report confirms criticisms of the valuation methodology used by GHA, particularly the failure to disaggregate entire cost categories, contingency costs, management costs or central overhead costs and the failure to account for the reduced and delayed call on GHA&rsquo;s private finance facility; notes that these valuation issues appear to compromise the principle of financial neutrality and to render individual stock transfers less viable, and calls on the Scottish Government to facilitate discussion and mediation between GHA and the relevant local housing organisations to ensure that second stage transfers proceed speedily and equitably in the interests of all tenants.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-1843.1</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Housing Association and Second Stage Transfers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1843) in the name of Robert Brown, after &quot;less viable&quot; insert &quot;believes that concerns in relation to the over-valuation of stock should mean that no housing association currently involved in the Secondary Stock Transfer Gateway process should be excluded on the basis of those valuations pending meaningful consideration of the issues raised in the Mazars study; further believes that any secondary stock transfer concluded using current valuations should receive a future financial adjustment if it is later found that said valuations were too high&quot;.</p>

<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1679#</strong> <strong>Christopher Harvie:</strong> <strong>Supermarket Dominance in Scottish Retailing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the dominance of large-scale supermarkets in Scottish retailing, as is evident in many of the burghs of Mid-Scotland and Fife, and considers that there should be an impartial study of their economic and social impact on communities and demand for local produce, taking into account other retail modes like smaller specialist shops, street markets or market halls and co-operatives.</p>
