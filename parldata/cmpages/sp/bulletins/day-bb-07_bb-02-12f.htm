<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5570</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>School Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) plays a vital role in raising standards of attainment and enhancing the learning of pupils and students at all stages of school and college education and supports its strategic priorities of promoting public accountability through inspection and reporting, working with other organisations to build the capacity of high-quality education and informing education policy development through knowledge of the whole education system, while managing and developing HMIE as a best value public body.</p>
<p>Supported by: Margo MacDonald<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5569</strong> <strong>Murray Tosh:</strong> <strong>Investment in Building Affordable Rented Homes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the need for increased investment in building affordable rented homes; further acknowledges that the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review is the most significant opportunity to secure this funding, which is essential to achieve the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s target that all unintentionally homeless people will have the right to a home by 2012, and recognises the case for committing the funding for 30,000 affordable homes for rent over the period 2008 to 2011.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5568</strong> <strong>Dave Petrie:</strong> <strong>Western Isles Demographic Trends</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Comhairle nan Eilean Siar&rsquo;s report on the demographic structure of the Western Isles; welcomes the recent increase in migration to the Western Isles which is a tribute to the high quality of life, beauty of landscape and openness of its people that the islands provide; is concerned to see a long-term decrease in the number of schoolchildren, people of working age and women of child-bearing age in the Western Isles; is further concerned that only 29% of current inward migrants to the islands are women; acknowledges the threat to the island way of life in the isles by a rising age structure and dependent population ratio, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with the local authority and look at ways to encourage more women and families to the islands to protect their long-term future.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5567</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Biometric and Surveillance Systems in Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent decision by UK ministers to issue guidance to schools on the use of biometric systems; welcomes the acknowledgement that a completely unregulated approach to such technologies is inappropriate; notes that biometric systems are in place in some Scottish schools; is concerned that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s initial description of parental consent as an &quot;essential pre-requisite&quot; before children can be fingerprinted has now been rephrased as merely a matter of &quot;good practice&quot;; considers that there is a need for clear guidance from the Executive on the use of biometric and surveillance systems in schools before any increase in their use is contemplated; notes that section 8 of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill is expected to lead to increased use of such systems; urges the Executive to produce guidance for education authorities on the implementation of section 8 and, in so doing, to give clear preference to systems other than those involving biometric and data-gathering technology; further notes that recent calls have been made for schools to introduce ID cards, CCTV, airport-style security scanners and random drug testing, and considers that wider debate is required on the role, if any, of such measures, the impact they may have on school culture and the limits within which they should operate.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5565</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with Lieutenant Ehren Watada</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the courageous stance of First Lieutenant Ehren Watada who on 22 June 2006 became the US Army&rsquo;s first commissioned officer to publicly refuse deployment to Iraq; notes that Lieutenant Watada, who appeared before a court martial on 5 February 2007, faces up to six years imprisonment for refusing to deploy to Iraq and for speaking out against a war that he believes is illegal, stating on the day he announced his decision &quot;As the order to take part in an illegal act is ultimately unlawful as well, I must refuse that order&quot;; further notes and applauds the following words spoken by Ehren Watada when he addressed the Veterans for Peace National Convention in America last year &quot;I stand before you today, not as an expert, not as one who pretends to have all the answers. I am simply an American and a servant of the American people. My humble opinions today are just that. I realise that you may not agree with everything I have to say. However, I did not choose to be a leader for popularity. I did it to serve and make better the soldiers of this country. And I swore to carry out this charge honourably under the rule of law. To stop an illegal and unjust war, soldiers can choose to stop fighting it. It became instrumental in ending the Vietnam war, but it has been long since forgotten. Now it is not an easy task for the soldier. For they must be aware that they are being used for ill gain. They must hold themselves responsible for individual action. They must remember that duty to the constitution and the people supersedes the ideologies of their leadership. The soldier must be willing to face ostracism by their peers, worry over the survival of their families and, of course, the loss of personal freedom. They must know that resisting an authoritarian government at home is equally important to fighting a foreign aggressor on the battlefield. Finally, those wearing the uniform must know beyond any doubt that, by refusing immoral and illegal orders, they will be supported by the people not with mere words but by action. Awareness of the history of atrocities and destruction committed in the name of America &ndash; either through direct military intervention or by proxy war &ndash; is crucial. They must realise that this is a war not out of self defence but by choice for profit and imperialistic domination. They must know that neither Congress nor this administration has the authority to violate the prohibition against pre-emptive war &ndash; an American law that still stands today. Though the American soldier wants to do right, the illegitimacy of the occupation itself, the policies of the administration and rules of engagement of desperate field commanders will ultimately force them to be a party of war crimes. The Nuremberg Trials showed America and the world that citizenry as well as soldiers have the unrelinquishable obligation to refuse complicity in war crimes perpetrated by their government. Widespread torture and inhumane treatment of detainees is a war crime. A war of aggression born through an unofficial policy of prevention is a crime against the peace. An occupation violating the very essence of international humanitarian law and sovereignty is a crime against humanity. These crimes are funded by our tax dollars. Should citizens choose to remain silent through self-imposed ignorance or choice, it makes them as culpable as a soldier in these crimes. I have broken no law but the code of silence and unquestioning loyalty. If I am guilty of any crime, it is that I learned too much and cared too deeply for the meaningless loss of my fellow soldiers and my fellow human beings. If I am to be punished, it should be for following the rule of law over the immoral orders of one man. If I am to be punished it should be for not acting sooner. Martin Luther King Jr once said &quot;History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.&quot; The time to fight back is now &ndash; the time to stand up and be counted is today&quot;; notes that Watada ended with another quote from Martin Luther King, &quot;One who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is, in reality, expressing the highest respect for the law&quot;; agrees to send a message of solidarity to Lieutenant Ehren Watada, and encourages Members and parliament staff to sign the on-line petition at: http://gao.org/ltwatada/join.html.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5564</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Increasing the Use of the Donald Dewar Room</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the little use made of the Donald Dewar Room, as evidenced by the figures recently produced by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre indicating that during 2006 it provided keys for an average of 11 visits per month and that the figures for the four months from September to December 2006 indicated an average of five people on each visit, and invites the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to put into effect changes in the arrangements for use of the Donald Dewar Room to enable more use to be made of it,&nbsp;either by visitors or by Members and staff.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5563&diams; </strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>ME Charities&rsquo; Response to DWP Guidance on ME/CFS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the statement by all the national ME representative organisations in response to version 9 of the Department of Work and Pensions&rsquo; (DWP) guidance document on ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS); further notes the unanimity of the condemnation contained within the response and the disappointment that, following extensive consultation, the DWP has made only minor changes in version 9 of the guidance, despite many of the proposals contained in the draft guidance being unanimously rejected in July 2006 by all the ME organisations involved; further notes that the DWP fails to recognise that ME/CFS is classified by the World Heath Organisation as a neurological disease, and is accepted as such by the Department of Health; finally notes that the guidelines grossly understate the seriousness, chronicity and progressive nature of this organic condition, especially for the severely affected who make up 25% of the ME/CFS population, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its influence to persuade the DWP to revise its final guidelines to ensure that ME/CFS sufferers receive the correct allocation of benefits to which they are entitled and that the views of sufferers&rsquo; representatives in Dumfries and Galloway and across Scotland are fully addressed within those guidelines.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5562</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Widespread Support for Airgun Ban</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the result of a recent System Three opinion poll indicated that 82% of Scottish citizens would support a ban on airguns and that only 8% are opposed to such a ban; further notes that the support for such a ban is highest, at 85%, among both the oldest and youngest sections of Scots; believes that this widespread support for an airgun ban should result in support for the member&rsquo;s bill proposal to ban air guns in the name of Tommy Sheridan or in the Scottish Executive agreeing to take over the proposal and deliver such a ban, and also notes the recent comments of senior sheriff, Richard Davidson, who said in Dundee Sheriff Court in relation to a woman found guilty of misusing an airgun, &quot;It is simply intolerable for anyone to be walking around the streets of this city, or indeed any city, with such a dangerous weapon and to be prepared to use it in the manner in which she did. What I don&rsquo;t understand is what our legislators are thinking about in permitting such an item to be available over the counter without requiring a firearms certificate&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5385#</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Awareness of Coeliac Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the average general practitioner has little or no experience of coeliac disease, an extremely debilitating illness that affects one in 100 of the population, of which seven out of eight are undiagnosed; regrets that the lack of knowledge of this condition prevents many people with coeliac disease from receiving early diagnosis, leading to serious complications such as osteoporosis and bowel cancer if left undetected; welcomes the work done by Coeliac UK in providing literature, advice, a helpline and dietary information to address this need, and believes that the Scottish Executive should promote such measures as it sees fit to ensure that GPs in the Lothians and throughout Scotland receive more appropriate training and support to enable them to recognise and to diagnose the disease more accurately.</p>
