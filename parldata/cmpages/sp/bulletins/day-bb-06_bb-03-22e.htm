<p><strong>S2W-24470</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in relation to the proposed tendering of Clyde and Hebridean Ferry Services, it has now developed a scheme in respect of pension provision for Caledonian MacBrayne (CalMac) staff and, if so, whether the scheme has been approved by the CalMac pension fund trustees, the company and the Pensions Regulator.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-24471</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S2W-23748, S2W-23831, S2W-23835 and S2W-23994 by Cathy Jamieson on 16 March 2006 where it states that it &quot;is not aware of any credible and reliable information to support the allegations that Scottish airports are being used&quot; for the purpose of transferring &quot;individuals through Scottish territory or airspace where there are substantial grounds to believe they would face a real risk of torture&quot; by US agencies, whether this indicates that it does not believe that this is happening presently, or has happened in the past.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-24472</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S2W-23748, S2W-23831, S2W-23835 and S2W-23994 by Cathy Jamieson on 16 March 2006 where it states that it &quot;is not aware of any credible and reliable information to support the allegations that Scottish airports are being used&quot; for the purpose of transferring &quot;individuals through Scottish territory or airspace where there are substantial grounds to believe they would face a real risk of torture&quot; by US agencies, whether this means that it discounts the evidence presented by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International that there have been instances of such transfers as being either credible or reliable.</p>

<p><strong>S2W-24474</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23831 by Cathy Jamieson on 16 March 2006 where it states that it &quot;has not approved and will not approve a policy of facilitating the transfer of individuals through Scottish territory or airspace to places where there are substantial grounds to believe that they would face a real risk of torture&quot;, whether it will now discuss with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government the matter of CIA flights landing in Scotland, given that the original question did not pertain to whether it granted permission for such transfers to occur through Scotland but whether it would establish whether they happened at all.</p>

<p><strong>S2W-24476</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question&nbsp;S2W-23835 by Cathy Jamieson on 16 March 2006, how this answer indicates why it does not intend taking a position on the opinions expressed by Lord Steyn.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-24477</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23994 by Cathy Jamieson on 16 March 2006, how this answer indicates whether or not it has discussed with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government the briefing paper sent by the Foreign Office to the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office stating that people captured by British forces could have been sent illegally to interrogation centres to establish whether there are any links between these reports and the allegations that US agencies have used Scottish airports as refuelling stops for flights engaged in the process of &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-24478</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23750 by Cathy Jamieson on 8 March 2006, why it has not stated what the purpose has been of its internal discussions regarding the matter of US agencies using Scottish airports as refuelling stops for flights allegedly involved in the process of &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; other than those &quot;in relation to the answering of parliamentary questions and other enquiries&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-24479</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23752 by Cathy Jamieson on 15 March 2006, why it had nothing to add to its previous answer to question S2W-22493, given that question S2W-23752 sought different information.</p>
