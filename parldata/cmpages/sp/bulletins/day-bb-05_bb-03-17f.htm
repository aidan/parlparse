That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2606</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Jamie Oliver&rsquo;s School Meals Programme and On-line Petition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Jamie Oliver and Channel 4 on the excellent programme &quot;Jamie&rsquo;s School Dinners&quot; which concluded on 16 March 2005; believes that Mr Oliver has put the Westminster Government to shame in highlighting the devastating state of school food served to children in England and the consequent threat to the future health of an entire generation and, in doing so, has underlined the urgent need for government intervention; notes the petition launched by Mr Oliver&rsquo;s website which urges people to sign up to the following statement: &quot;I believe kids need a healthy diet so we need to change school dinners to ban the junk and get fresh, nutritious meals back on the plate. I support the Feed Me Better campaign&quot;; further notes that within two days of the petition being launched, well over 50,000 people have already signed, with the number of signatures going up by the second; congratulates Hull City Council on its three-year pilot programme of providing free and healthy school breakfasts, dinners and after-school snacks to all primary schoolchildren, and the Welsh Assembly on its free school breakfasts policy for all children, and looks forward to Glasgow City Council carrying out its manifesto promise to provide free, nutritious school meals to all primary schoolchildren in Glasgow by 2007.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2605</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Simon Pepper OBE, Retiral from WWF Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the contribution of Simon Pepper OBE to the environmental movement in Scotland and internationally for the last two decades and more; notes his announcement that he will retire from his post as Director of WWF Scotland in June 2005; recognises his unique contribution which has enabled and inspired many individuals and organisations to take action, not just on environmental policy but right across the sustainable development and public policy agenda, and particularly applauds his widely-respected work in supporting and building initiatives such as Scottish Environment LINK and the Millennium Forest for Scotland and his vigorous efforts to help Scotland become a forward-looking, globally-responsible and sustainable country.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2604#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the recent decision taken by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) not to recommend the use of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine in the treatment of newly-diagnosed sufferers of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in England; acknowledges the uncertainty and concern that this decision will cause the families of Alzheimer&rsquo;s sufferers in Scotland; recognises that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will take any such decision in Scotland; is aware that there are 62,000 sufferers of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in Scotland and that a significant proportion of these people are currently being prescribed these drugs; accepts that the drugs are widely available in the United States and across the rest of Europe to successfully treat Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; acknowledges the work of Age Concern and Alzheimer Scotland in raising awareness of the disease and providing advice and support for sufferers and their families; is aware that Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is a recognised terminal illness; notes that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland has not yet approved the use of memantine and has not yet taken a final decision on prescribing practices for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease on the basis of the NICE recommendations, but considers that the Scottish Executive should look at the wider picture and take into account the benefits that the use of these drugs have been proven to have for sufferers and their families across the rest of Europe and beyond.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2603#</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Disability Rights Commission Employment Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) on its new employment campaign aimed at increasing confidence among small employers in the benefits of recruiting and retaining disabled staff and exploding some popular myths about the costs to businesses of doing so; believes that more support should be offered to the one million disabled people in Britain who are unemployed but who want to find work; recognises that, while people who become disabled during their working years may have to alter their employment patterns, they retain highly-valuable and transferable skills and experience, and considers that all employers should fully embrace the DRC campaign, recognise that disabled people represent a vast, untapped source of talent, and take positive steps to address under-representation of disabled people in the workplace.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2602#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the preliminary recommendations of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) which, while recognising the effectiveness of three dementia drugs, donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine, to many sufferers, recommends withdrawing these drugs on the grounds of cost to the NHS in England and Wales; endorses the call by Alzheimer Scotland that all patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease who are considered suitable by their doctors for these treatments should receive them until it can be shown that either they are not or are no longer benefiting, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that the NICE recommendations are not adopted by NHS Scotland to avoid a disastrous decision for the 62,000 sufferers of dementia in Scotland and their families.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2601#</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>City of Perth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the foundation of Perth as a royal burgh dates back to a charter granted by King William the Lion in 1210 and that the first reference to Perth as a city came in the Golden Charter granted by King James VI in 1600; recognises that between 1600 and the early 19th century the use of the terms &quot;city&quot;, &quot;burgh&quot; and &quot;town&quot; was interchangeable and that from the early 19th century Perth was consistently referred to as a city in official documents such as Acts of Parliament; further recognises that this use continued in the 20th century when the terms &quot;City of Perth&quot; and &quot;Royal Burgh of Perth&quot; appeared in many official documents, and welcomes Perth and Kinross Council&rsquo;s intention to reaffirm Perth&rsquo;s status as one of Scotland&rsquo;s historic and modern-day cities with a declaration in the old Council Chambers and a series of events leading up to the celebration of the 800th anniversary of the City of Perth in 2010.</p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2597.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2597) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;fully endorses a comprehensive education system based on equality of opportunity for all from the nursery sector through to secondary education and beyond; supports a reduction in class sizes to no more than 20 or, indeed, less, along with suitably-qualified support teachers with expertise in working alongside classroom teachers to support pupils with special educational needs and social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, and recognises that early intervention in early years, learning styles and developing emotional intelligence are key areas that require different approaches to learning and teaching, alongside flexibility to ensure that all children and young people reach their potential.&quot;</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2597.3</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2597) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the dedication of teachers and support staff in Scotland&rsquo;s schools to achieving excellent outcomes for the young people of Scotland; supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s agenda for the most comprehensive modernisation programme in Scottish schools for a generation, as described in <em>Ambitious, Excellent Schools; </em>acknowledges the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to building on the investment and successes in education over recent years; welcomes plans to bring a transformation in ambition and achievement through higher expectations for schools and school leadership, and recognises greater freedom for teachers and schools, better parental involvement and choice for pupils, increased and further enhancement of school/college partnerships to extend learning opportunities for pupils and better support for learning so that the individual needs of young people can be better met through tough, intelligent accountabilities to drive improvement.&quot;</p>
