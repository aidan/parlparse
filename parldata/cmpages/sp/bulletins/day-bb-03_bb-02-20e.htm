            evidence, whether or not it is given by scientists, and, if so, what

            in the United States of America and, in particular, the provision 
            in this rule that states &quot;if scientific, technical, or other 
            specialised knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand 
            the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified 
            as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, 
            may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1)

            is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness 
            has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the 
            case&quot;; whether it will assess the present rules of expert evidence 
            in Scotland against these criteria; whether the Scottish rules fall 
            short of this standard and, if so, in what ways, and whether it will 
            bring forward proposals to improve rules of evidence based upon this 
            standard.</p>
