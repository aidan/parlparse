<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>

<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section </a>the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7738&diams;
  Des McNulty: 70th Anniversary of the Clydebank Blitz</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the Clydebank Blitz; recognises that the destruction inflicted by aerial bombardment on 13 and 14 March 1941 in Clydebank was proportionately the worst suffered in any part of the United Kingdom, leaving only seven houses undamaged in the town and over 48,000 people homeless; mourns the hundreds of people who lost their lives, along withthose who were seriously injured; praises the heroism of service personnel, health and local authority workers and volunteers in Clydebank at the time of the Blitz; welcomes the efforts of West Dunbartonshire Council, local church congregations and other local groups to ensure that the anniversary is recognised in an appropriate fashion;  acknowledges the terrible price paid by Clydebank, and considers there to be a need to invest in the regeneration of the town that was affected not only by the Blitz but also by the collapse of the shipbuilding and engineering industries on which the economy of the town was so dependent.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7737 Robin Harper: Opportunities for Young People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus in founding, in 1976, the Grameen Bank, which provides microfinance for people living in poverty in Bangladesh; recognises that, since its beginnings in Bangladesh, there arenow Grameen-type programmes tackling poverty across 38 countries around the world and that Grameen America is now branchingout to many new locations in New York, Nebraska, Washington DC and California; believes that there is an opportunity to tackle the growingproblem of unemployment among 16 to 19-year-olds with the establishment of a microcredit scheme for young people in Scotland;notes that this scheme could offer loans for small business ventures to young people who are not in education, employment ortraining and be supported by an entrepreneurial mentoring scheme; further believes that such a scheme would build on thecontribution made by Scotland&rsquo;s social enterprise sector and draw on Scotland&rsquo;s long history of entrepreneurial achievement, and calls on the Scottish Government to explore ways to establish a Scottish youth microcredit scheme.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7735 Patrick Harvie: Protecting Public Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on ministers to open discussions in good faith with their UK counterparts regarding the prompt re-establishment of the democratically endorsed Scottish variable rate of income tax; believes that the UK Government&rsquo;s cuts agenda is ideologically driven, economically illiterate and will have a disproportionate impact on poorer people both in Scotland and in the rest of the UK; rejects the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision simply to hand on these cuts to Scottish public services, with housing, energy efficiency and public transport particularly at threat; believes that the terms of the proposed council tax freeze reduce local authorities&rsquo; ability to make their own democratic decisions and look at alternatives to cutting vital local services, and urges the Scottish Government to revise the draft budget to reduce these cuts by incorporating progressive ways to raise revenue at a local level within the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament to ensure that wealthier people pay more and poorer people pay less, including options such as land value tax, a hotel bed tax and reducing exemptions to the uniform business rate.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7717 John Scott: Discards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns what it believes to be the reprehensible, yet widespread, practice of discarding fish whereby dead or dying fish are thrown back into the sea; considers that this is utterly indefensible on environmental, economic and ethical grounds; notes that the practice occurs as a direct result of what it views as the ill-thought-out and inflexible decrees of the European Common Fisheries Policy, and believes that the Scottish Government, the UK Government, the European Commission, Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen and all other interested parties should work together to find solutions to bring about a speedy termination of discarding in Scottish waters.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7717.1 Robin Harper: Discards</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7717) in the name of John Scott, insert at end &quot;; considers that most North Sea fish stocks, especially cod, have been at an all-time low for at least a decade due to relentless overfishing and that most proposals from the European Commission have been successfully undermined year on year by an alliance of EU politicians and fishing interests, and urges the Scottish Government and all EU partners to cooperate in reducing the catching capacity of the entire EU fishing fleet as a precursor to the landing of all catch and the development of a more sophisticated strategy that will allow for the introduction of further targeted conservation policies to be introduced, understood and properly implemented&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7713 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Earth Hour 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the *WWF&rsquo;s* Earth Hour 2011, which is scheduled to take place at 8.30 pm on 26 March 2011, and what it hopes will be the thousands of people across Scotland joining hundreds of millions across the globe in switching off their lights for 60 minutes to demonstrate support for tackling climate change; considers the implementation of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 to be a priority for the Scottish Government; welcomes the publication of <em>Low Carbon Scotland:The</em> <em>Draft Report on Proposals and Policies </em>by the Scottish Government and calls on it to ensure that policies are in place to enable Scotland to meet its annual emissions reduction target and its target of achieving a 42<strong>%</strong> reduction in overall emissions by 2020; considers that the benefits of tackling climate change will be better homes, healthier lifestyles, a much-improved public transport system and a fairer Scotland; welcomes the investment, skills and job opportunities in moving toward a low-carbon future, and calls on countries around the world to sign up to a fair, ambitious and binding global deal on climate change at the UN climate talks in December 2011.</p>
