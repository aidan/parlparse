            application to the Scottish Football League.</font></p>

            McNeill: Sex Trade</strong>—That the Parliament notes the content of the 

            ITV programme <i>Vice – Inside Britain’s Sex Business: The New Slave 

            Trade</i>, broadcast on 10 April 2001, which highlighted the plight 

            of an estimated 5,000 Eastern European women and girls who have been 

            lured to the UK, held against their will and forced to act as prostitutes 

            under the threat of violence with no passports and no money; further 

            notes the identification of at least six addresses in Glasgow where 

            this trade is known, and calls upon the Scottish Executive and the 

            international authorities to take action to crush this crime, seek 

            out the entrapped women, release them and provide a means for them 

            to return to safety. </font></p>

            Grahame: Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week 2001</strong>—That the Parliament 

            notes with concern that, while Scotland is the multiple sclerosis 

            (MS) capital of the world with 10,400 people with MS, only 2.4% of 

            these people have access to beta interferon compared with equivalent 

            percentages of 15% in Finland and 13% in Italy; notes that the cost 

            of providing beta interferon to those in Scotland who might benefit 

            would be some £7 million, representing a minute fraction of the NHS 

            budget; queries the cost of beta interferon in Scotland as compared 

            to elsewhere; notes the inadequate provision of physiotherapy for 

            those affected by MS; further notes the lack of provision of specialist 

            MS nurses; affirms that MS nurses should be fully funded by the NHS; 

            notes that there is an urgent need for suitable respite facilities; 

            recommends that it be standard practice on a diagnosis of MS that 

            the appropriate consultant meet the patient’s GP to inform them and 

            discuss the case, as many GPs may only occasionally see a case of 

            MS and may therefore be uninformed about the disease and treatments; 

            considers that money expended on the above will not only benefit the 

            10,400 people with MS and their carers but would also lead to a net 

            saving to the public purse, and commends all those with MS, their 

            carers and the MS Society for their continuing campaign for justice 

            in health care provision.</font></p>
