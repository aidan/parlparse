            <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Compensation for Miners</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should launch an urgent and wide-ranging 
            inquiry into the circumstances causing the severe and unacceptable 
            delays in relation to the compensation for miners in Scotland who 
            have contracted serious and debilitating illnesses and injuries as 
            a result of their employment as miners and who are still awaiting 
            compensation for the contraction of illnesses such as emphysema, bronchitis 
            and vibration white finger among others, and further believes that 
            such an inquiry should involve the National Union of Mineworkers in 
            Scotland, retired Scottish miners' branches and the families of deceased 
            Scots miners and should look into the objectivity of medical examinations 
            with a view to streamlining the whole procedure. </font></p>

            University of York, Aberlour Child Care Trust, Extern, Children's 
            Promise and The Children's Society for producing this report, the 
            most extensive piece of research yet undertaken into young people 
            under 16 who run away or are forced to leave home; notes that this 
            is the first comprehensive research to provide both an overall picture 
            of the scale and extent of the problem while suggesting workable strategies 
            for responding to the needs of this very vulnerable group of young 
            people, and asks the Executive to look closely at the findings and

            for Environment before he does further damage to Scotland's interests; 
            notes two occasions in one week when he has overturned recommendations 
            by the Planning Inquiry Reporter, and believes that rejecting the 
            second recommendation, that regarding Ayr United's Stadium and adjacent 
            retail complex, flies in the face of the unanimous opinion of South 
            Ayrshire Council and shows contempt for the interests of Ayr and Prestwick 
            as towns, for the aspirations of the local football club and for the
