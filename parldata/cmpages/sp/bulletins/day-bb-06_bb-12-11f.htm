<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5299</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Academic Freedom Must be Safeguarded</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that there has been an erosion of faith that the Scottish Executive will report accurately the findings of commissioned research, such as the recent report on youth crime whose authors have since faced disciplinary action which they claim was instigated following pressure from the Executive after they wrote an article for a criminal studies journal highlighting findings including, among others, concerns that the youth courts are in breach of human rights legislation, which were omitted from the final report; further notes with increasing concern the comments made by Mr Walters, the report&rsquo;s co-author, who told <em>Holyrood</em> magazine that the Executive had created an environment where &quot;universities are terrified about losing contracts and academics are looking over their shoulders, being careful not to say anything critical of the Executive&quot; adding that &quot;one of the hallmarks of a democratic society is the free and open flow of information and a state that prevents, disrupts or misrepresents that flow is acting in a way that is, I would argue, corrupt&quot;; resolutely condemns the manipulation of independent research in order to claim political success, and believes that the Executive should initiate an internal investigation to get to the bottom of this matter.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5298</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Call for Independent Inquiry into PFI Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Centre for International Public Health at the University of Edinburgh for its report on the private financing of our health service; notes the disturbing rise in the cost to Scotland&rsquo;s health care budget from &pound;107 million now to &pound;510 million in five years; considers that this is a major threat to patient care, and calls for a major independent inquiry into the costs and impacts of PFI in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5297</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Breathalyser Pilot Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the introduction of the ignition interlock system for breathalysing people in Canada has resulted in a reduction of 75% in the number of persistent drink drivers getting behind the wheel; notes that curbing such offending behaviour brings benefits by reducing the resource pressure on hospitals and emergency staff and ultimately on the courts; acknowledges that the ignition interlock system does not offer a panacea in terms of ending the scourge of drink driving but would be a significant tool in preventing and helping to prevent some of the 50 deaths and 270 injuries per year directly attributed to drink driving behaviour, and therefore calls on the Scottish government to introduce an extensive pilot scheme using the ignition interlock system, which would be fitted to the vehicles of those convicted of drink driving offences as a way of significantly reducing the number of deaths and injuries on Scotland&rsquo;s roads as a result of drink driving offending and further acting as a deterrent.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5296</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>&quot;Euro-trashed&quot; Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Communications Workers Union&rsquo;s &quot;Euro-trashed&quot; campaign to give agency workers equal employment rights and to rectify the current situation where the United Kingdom has the worst employment law in Europe in relation to the rights of agency workers.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5294</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Assistance for Annan Workforce</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by Young&rsquo;s Seafood Limited to send Scottish seafood 12,000 miles to Thailand to be processed; notes that this decision will result in the loss of 120 jobs in Young&rsquo;s processing plant in Annan and that this is due to the company&rsquo;s belief that the local workforce earns prohibitive wages, despite local wages being no higher than the national average; notes that Young&rsquo;s is currently undertaking the statutory 90-day consultation period to try and find suitable alternative employment for its workers in the local area and that this period is due to expire at the beginning of February; sympathises with the workforce which is currently suffering the uncertainty over potential job losses, and calls on the Scottish Executive, in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Industry, to explore programmes such as regional assistance to aid the retention of jobs in Annan.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5292</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Need for Integrated Free Public Transport in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that global warming is currently the greatest threat posed to the future of humanity and the planet; considers that grave threats need radical solutions, yet Scotland is unlikely to achieve the ambitious targets set by the Scottish Executive while it continues to pursue car-friendly road-building policies, and therefore agrees to support the phasing-in of an integrated free public transport system throughout Scotland which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, putting Scotland at the forefront of efforts to save the planet, reduce congestion, thus saving hundreds of millions of pounds for Scottish businesses, and provide a huge boost to the Scottish economy through increasing the disposable income of low-paid households who are the most likely to use public transport.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5287</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Trident Renewal Debate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication by the UK Government of its White Paper on the future of the Trident nuclear missile system on Monday 4 December 2006; acknowledges the Prime Minister&rsquo;s call for &quot;a very full process of debate&quot; on this profoundly serious area of policy; recognises the need for the debate fully to explore the military, economic and political consequences of Trident renewal; believes that a convincing case can be made, in military, economic and political terms, for the non-renewal of Trident, and therefore advises electors to lobby their Westminster representatives to urge them to vote against the renewal of Trident in any debate held on that subject in the House of Commons.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5284#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Voice Must Be Heard</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes, with due concern in respect of the legitimacy of open and free democratic debate, that the outcome of the much-publicised debate on a replacement to Trident has already been reached through the Conservative Party&rsquo;s committed support to the Government&rsquo;s stated position; expresses disappointment that a real debate cannot be secured in either the House of Commons or the Scottish Parliament; considers that this issue is of great importance to the people of Scotland, especially considering the very real danger to Glasgow and much of the west through contamination in the event of a nuclear accident, and therefore believes that the people of Scotland should be given the chance to debate this tough issue and to decide by means of a referendum on Trident, echoing the sentiments of the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament when, as reported in <em>The Scotsman</em>, he stated that referenda &quot;provide citizens with tangible power over what they see as the crucial issues of the day, even if these have been ignored by the Executive and the Parliament&quot;.</p>
