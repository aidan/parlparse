<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4229</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>World Health Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to celebrate World Health Day, which is this year devoted to health workers and to highlighting the global health worker shortage; believes that we should celebrate the work of health workers in Scotland and across the world for all the hard work that they do; recognises that the World Health Organisation blames the current chronic shortage on under-investment in education, training, salaries, working environment and management which leads to career switching and national and international migration; understands that Africa is badly affected by this shortage when combined with having to deal with the HIV/AIDS pandemic; recognises that the Parliament unfortunately cannot deal with international issues and, until it can, believes that the Scottish Executive should exert pressure at Westminster to do all it can to cancel third world debt as a way to allow countries to have disposable money to invest in health care.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4228&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Muscular Dystrophy &quot;My Life&quot;Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that there are 3,000 people in Scotland with inherited neuromuscular disorders and muscular dystrophy; is concerned that in Cumbernauld &amp; Kilsyth, whilst some constituents tell of good provision of electric wheelchairs and praise the staff delivering social services care, some have never received a full needs assessment of their home environment and can only experience care services delivered via an inflexible system weighted towards older people that does not accommodate the lifestyle that other young people are able to enjoy; notes that this is an example of the variation in standards and availability of care, service and equipment provision across Scotland; supports the work of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign in pioneering the search for treatments and cures for over 40 years, whilst also providing practical, professional and emotional support for people affected by neuromuscular conditions; in particular, supports the Muscular Dystrophy &quot;My Life&quot; campaign and its work in Scotland to encourage a co-ordinated approach by local authorities and NHS boards when assessing individuals&rsquo; needs and requirements, and considers the findings of the &quot;My Life&quot; expert group to be a model for future delivery of services to people affected by neuromuscular conditions.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4227</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Below the Radar: Secret Flights to Torture and &lsquo;Disappearance&rsquo;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the report, <em>Below the radar: Secret flights to torture and &lsquo;disappearance&rsquo;,</em> by Amnesty International; agrees that &quot;the programme of rendition and secret detention is eroding the human security and rule of law it claims to protect&quot;, and supports Amnesty International&rsquo;s call for a full public inquiry.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4226</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Thomas Blake Glover</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the esteem in which Scotsman Thomas Blake Glover is held in Japan; notes that Glover introduced the first railway locomotive to Japan, was responsible for that country&rsquo;s first mechanised coal mine, and that his shipbuilding company later grew into what is today known worldwide as the Mitsubishi Corporation; wishes success to the forthcoming photographic exhibition on the life of Glover at the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in his native Fraserburgh, and welcomes this initiative as an opportunity to build links between north-east Scotland and Japan, where Glover&rsquo;s house annually attracts around two million visitors.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4225</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Real Nappy Week Tenth Anniversary 24 to 30 April 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes and sends a message of encouragement on its tenth anniversary to Real Nappy Week which runs from 24 to 30 April 2006; notes that three billion nappies per year, or eight million nappies per day, are thrown away in the United Kingdom with 90% ending up in landfill sites; further notes that 90% of local authorities have already signed up to Real Nappy Week and that parents could save &pound;500 on the cost of nappies for one baby if they used washable rather than disposable nappies, and commends the Scottish Waste Awareness Group and the Waste and Resources Action Programme for their work in jointly delivering the Real Nappy Campaign.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4224</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Launch of &quot;Come off it&quot; on 4 April 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of &quot;Come off it&quot; on 4 April 2006, and the message promoted on its website, www.comeoffit.org.uk, that everybody can make a difference in reducing the amount of energy that is wasted every day by taking simple actions, such as switching off all appliances that are on standby and replacing regular light bulbs with energy-efficient bulbs; encourages everyone to take such simple actions today and the Scottish Parliament to set a lead example in energy efficiency, with all MSPs and their staff ensuring that their computers and office lights are switched off at the end of the day, and welcomes the ethos behind &quot;Come off it&quot; which realises that we must reduce pollution in order to stop climate chaos which will damage and change our planet.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4205.1#</strong> <strong>Euan Robson:</strong> <strong>Closure of Borders CABx</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4205) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave out from &quot;and therefore&quot; to end and insert &quot;; believes that Scottish Borders Council should change its decision not to meet the CABx&rsquo; request fully to fund its staff, and further believes that the council should meet with MSPs and the CABx&rsquo; steering group with a view to delivering resources commensurate with the needs of Borderers.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3971*#*</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Mental Health and Deaf and Deafblind People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges and supports the campaign by the Scottish Council on Deafness (SCoD) for equal access to mainstream and specialist mental health services for deaf and deafblind people in Scotland; notes the widespread lack of provision for deaf and deafblind people who have specific language and communication needs and that presently their rights under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Scotland Act 2003 and Disability Discrimination Act 2005 are not being met, leading to misdiagnosis and unsuitable treatments being applied; further notes with concern the complete lack of consultant psychiatrists in Scotland who are trained and experienced to work with deaf and deafblind people who have mental health problems and that the nearest available specialist mental health service for deaf and deafblind inpatients is Manchester whose outreach service, which is currently used by Scots deaf and deafblind people, is now under threat of closure; endorses the campaign for a specialist mental health service for deaf and deafblind people in Scotland, funded through the NHS, and SCoD&rsquo;s aim of providing support for training and recruiting of deaf and deafblind people to enable them to work with deaf and deafblind patients; backs SCoD&rsquo;s call for additional resourcing for mainstream psychiatric services in both hospital and community settings which would lead to greater accessibility for deaf and deafblind people with mental health problems, and recommends the establishment of a specialist Scottish centre for deaf and deafblind people with mental health problems in the south of Scotland or other suitable region.</p>
