          <p><strong>*S2M-679</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade 
            Universities</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the decision by 
            the Students' Association of the University of Edinburgh to work towards 
            Fairtrade University status; acknowledges the ongoing campaigns of 
            People and Planet groups in the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, 
            Dundee and Aberdeen and the One World Group in St Andrews to get Fairtrade 
            accreditation for their universities from the Fairtrade Foundation; 
            urges universities and students' associations to respond positively 
            to these campaigns by meeting the five goals set by the Fairtrade 
            Foundation, including requirements to stock and promote Fairtrade 
            goods at university shops and outlets, serve Fairtrade products at 
            university and student union meetings and establish a written policy 
            and steering group on setting and meeting Fairtrade targets; believes 
            such campaigns play an important part in raising the awareness of 
            current unfair trade rules that force millions of people in developing 
            countries into poverty and of the pressing need for trade justice; 
            further believes that supporting Fairtrade plays a practical role 
            in increasing the sale of products that benefit the world's poorest 
            nations, and urges all Scottish universities to become officially-accredited 
            Fairtrade Universities.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-678#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Winter 
            Fuel Deaths</strong>-That the Parliament notes with extreme concern 
            recent figures that show there were 2,510 deaths from cold-related 
            illnesses during the winter of 2002-03, the majority of these being 
            elderly people, which is an increase of nearly 700 from the previous 
            year; condemns such statistics as reprehensible in Scotland in the 
            21st century and, while welcoming the Scottish Executive's central 
            heating and warm homes programmes, recognises that the delivery of 
            these programmes must be radically improved to reach all senior citizens 
            in need as soon as possible, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should use its powers fully to tackle fuel poverty by looking at new 
            initiatives that would release additional financial resources to the 
            elderly for household essentials like heating.</P>
          <p></P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-677#</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Crisis 
            in Scottish Football</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its concern 
            at the current financial predicament of many of Scotland's football 
            clubs; notes that in the past week Dundee Football Club has gone into 
            administration, as have a number of clubs over recent years; considers 
            that the national bodies governing football, including the SPL, Scottish 
            Football League and Scottish Football Association should encourage 
            better financial management of football clubs and much greater involvement 
            of supporters through football trusts, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should ensure that any public money for football is invested 
            at a grass-roots level to develop the game in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-676#</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Fatigue 
            and Chronic Neurological Illnesses</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            that there are many thousands of individuals living with chronic neurological 
            illnesses in Scotland, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), chronic 
            fatigue syndrome (CFS), multiple sclerosis (MS), post polio syndrome 
            (PPS) and fibromyalgis; notes that one of the major causes of stress 
            in this population is fatigue associated with their condition; further 
            notes that, given the range of illnesses and care needs, patients 
            are often given inappropriate treatment and medications, and therefore 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should consider as a first step 
            the establishment of a centre of excellence specifically to assess, 
            treat and research ways of managing and improving such individuals' 
            life quality and that any centre should be promoted in such a manner 
            as the Scottish Executive sees fit to ensure that GPs and other health 
            professionals are informed of this new service and are encouraged 
            to refer patients as the need arises.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-675</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>The 
            Symphony of Dreams Trust</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the Symphony of Dreams Trust for the good work it has been doing in 
            Glasgow; notes that the trust was created to help fulfil the musical 
            dreams of people who are chronically sick, disabled or who suffer 
            from the effects of poverty, and wishes continued success to the trust 
            in its activities such as encouraging people to achieve their musical 
            aspirations by giving them a chance to hear, feel, see and create 
            music.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-674#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>7:84 
            Theatre Company</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 7:84 
            Theatre Company (Scotland) on the many ground-breaking achievements 
            in the first 30 years of its operation; commends its philosophy of 
            bringing touring productions and participatory outreach work to areas 
            of geographic and social isolation; notes, however, that the company 
            will struggle to survive if it loses its Scottish Arts Council funding 
            from March 2005, and believes that the Scottish Executive should investigate 
            the situation affecting 7:84 and other similar theatre companies.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-673</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Saving 
            7:84</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the great contribution 
            that 7:84 Theatre Company (Scotland) has made to the cultural and 
            political life of Scotland over many years; notes that a previous 
            attempt was made to close the company under the Tory government and 
            finds it deeply ironic that the company faces closure under a Labour 
            government, and calls on the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport 
            to intervene to ensure that the Scottish Arts Council has sufficient 
            funds to continue funding the theatre and that all Scotland's theatre 
            and music companies can continue to deliver stimulating and high standards 
            of work.</P>

            (West Coast) (No.11) (Scotland) Order 2003 (SSI 2003/561)</strong>-That 
            the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency 
            Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.11) (Scotland)

          <p><strong>S2M-669</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Help 
            the Aged SeniorLine</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            that Help the Aged has decided to close their office in Scotland which 
            runs SeniorLine, the free telephone advice service for older people, 
            in December; recognises that experienced trained welfare rights advisers 
            have answered thousands of queries from people in Scotland, particularly 
            following the very effective campaign with the <em>Daily Record</em> 
            to promote the uptake of the new pension credit; is concerned that 
            if future calls from Scotland are answered by advisers in the London 
            office with no experience or training in Scots law and unaware of 
            policy differences between Scotland and the rest of the UK, such as 
            free personal care, the recent positive developments to remove the

          <p></P>
          <p>citizens in Scotland will be damaged and undermined, and therefore 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's 
            Government to ensure the future security of Help the Aged, a partner 
            organisation in the take-up campaign, and particularly to reconsider 
            the closure of the Scottish office of SeniorLine.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-668</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Bhopal 
            Anniversary</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 19th anniversary 
            of the disaster at Bhopal; calls on the Dow Chemical Company to ensure 
            that its 100%-owned subsidiary Union Carbide, along with ex-chairman 
            Warren Anderson, end their 11-year absence from criminal proceedings 
            in Bhopal and face trial; calls on Dow to assume responsibility for 
            the long-term effects of Union Carbide's gases and provide long-term 
            health care for the victims and those as yet unborn who may be affected; 
            further calls on Dow to clean up Union Carbide's heavily-contaminated 
            factory site in Bhopal and provide safe drinking water for communities 
            whose wells have been poisoned by chemicals leaking from the factory, 
            and further calls on Dow to provide economic and social support to 
            people who have been incapacitated by their injuries and families 
            who have become destitute as a result of losing their breadwinner.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-667#</strong> <strong>Kate Maclean:</strong> <strong>Photodynamic 
            Therapy for the Treatment of Wet Age Related Macular Degeneration 
            (AMD)</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent decision by NHS 
            Quality Improvement Scotland on the use of photodynamic therapy for 
            the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and acknowledges 
            that photodynamic therapy is the only effective treatment for wet 
            AMD, the most aggressive form of the disease and the leading cause 
            of blindness in the UK, with around 650 new patients diagnosed with 
            wet AMD in Scotland every year; is deeply concerned that funding has 
            not been made available for clinicians to treat on the NHS those patients 
            who urgently require the therapy, and endorses the demand by the Royal 
            National Institute of the Blind Scotland and the Macular Disease Society 
            that the Scottish Executive ensures that funding is immediately provided 
            by all NHS boards, thereby saving the sight of those who could benefit 
            from the therapy.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-666</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Highlands 
            Tourism</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Highland tourism 
            group Highlands Loch Ness on the initiative and enterprise shown in 
            chartering the vessel <em>Lord of the Glens</em> and sailing it from 
            Buckie to Custom House Quay in London's docklands where it stood out 
            as a shining beacon at the World Travel Market Exposition and was 
            a focal point for those advertising the style and excellence of Highland

          <p><strong>S2M-665</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Use 
            of Sewel Motions</strong>-That the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive's 
            use of the convention known as the Sewel motion; recognises that there 
            are occasional circumstances where the use of Sewel motions is an 
            appropriate legislative route; believes that such motions should not 
            be used for specifically political reasons and that an action of this 
            nature would undermine the authority of the Parliament; further believes 
            that it is possible for a process to be developed by which the Scottish 
            Parliament can fully scrutinise a bill that is in passage at Westminster, 
            and considers that this process would require a committee of the Scottish 
            Parliament to consider the UK bill with sufficient time to take evidence 
            and report, the Scottish Parliament to debate the committee's report 
            and agree recommendations for amendments to those parts of the bill 
            that relate to Scotland, such recommendations to be submitted to the 
            UK Parliament with sufficient time for their incorporation into the 
            bill and a second Sewel motion to be considered by the Scottish Parliament 
            to approve this bill as amended, before the bill is approved by the 
            UK Parliament.</P>

            cultural work of the 7:84 Theatre Company (Scotland) and its positive 
            innovative role in the social inclusion agenda; deeply regrets the 
            decision of the Scottish Arts Council to change the funding structure 
            for 7:84, and calls for the reinstatement of the three years core

            that the implementation of the programme will make to the health of 
            ethnic and cultural minorities in the Greater Glasgow area; congratulates

            notes that its success was the result of four years of dedication 
            and preparation based on a strong club structure, which contains valuable 
            lessons for the Scottish Rugby Union; trusts that England will use 
            its term as world champions to help develop the game further throughout 
            the world, and hopes that, before defending its title in 2007, it

            of Globalisation on Jobs in the Scottish Finance Sector</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is concerned that Lloyds TSB/Scottish Widows is considering 
            plans to transfer some of its operations to India, with the potential 
            loss of many hundreds of Edinburgh-based jobs; notes that moves to 
            replace Scottish workers with significantly lower-paid labour abroad 
            could put pressure on other finance companies to follow suit, with 
            serious consequences for jobs and the economy, and believes that the 
            Scottish Executive should seek a commitment from Lloyds TSB/Scottish 
            Widows that it will cease developing plans to transfer work abroad.</P>

            National Park P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta a' Ch&agrave;irn Ghuirm</strong>-That 
            the Parliament, while welcoming the designation of the Cairngorm National 
            Park, expresses concern that the provisional Gaelic name being given 
            to the park is P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta a' Mhonaidh Ruaidh which 
            translates as the Red Mountain National Park; believes that this name 
            is inaccurate and misleading as the national park will contain both 
            the Monadh Ruadh and the Monadh Liath mountain ranges (Red and Grey 
            mountains), and, in order to avoid confusion, considers that the park's 
            name should be the same in both English and Gaelic, that is Cairngorm 
            National Park and P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta a' Ch&agrave;irn Ghuirm.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-655#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Drug 
            Assisted Rape</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            properties of the drugs Rohypnol (roofies) and gamma hydroxybutyrate 
            (GHB, Liquid E or Liquid X), commonly known as &quot;date-rape&quot; 
            drugs or &quot;forget pills&quot; as the sedative effects are seven 
            to ten times greater than Valium; further notes the extensive foundation 
            work carried out by Detective Chief Inspector Peter Sturman of the 
            Metropolitan Police Serious Crime Group on the subject; welcomes the 
            banning of GHB in June 2003 because of government concerns over its 
            use in sexual attacks; further welcomes the Scottish Executive's plans 
            to respond to increasing public concern over date-rape drugs and to 
            take the matter seriously by running a major festive season information 
            campaign including leaflets, posters and videos in pubs and clubs 
            and, hopefully, also in universities, colleges and schools; notes 
            that although over 60 drug-related sexual abuse victims in Scotland 
            have, since 1997, contacted The Roofie Foundation which provides assistance 
            and support, fewer than 15% of victims report these crimes and in 
            Scotland only two convictions have ever taken place, and considers 
            that drug-assisted rape should be recognised as a major crime.</P>

            Summit</strong>-That the Parliament supports the efforts of the Scottish 
            Executive and others to make Scotland a regular venue for major international 
            events; welcomes the news that Scotland is being considered as a potential 
            venue for the G8 summit meeting; believes that such an event provides 
            an excellent opportunity to promote Scotland on the world stage as 
            well as providing economic benefits to local businesses, and believes

            Kingdom armed forces and the impact that these will have on Scotland's 
            famous regiments; believes that, in a time of uncertainty due to international 
            turbulence and terrorism and with our forces deployed and over-stretched 
            throughout the world, our regiments, including the Black Watch, the 
            Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers, should be strengthened 
            and not cut back or disbanded, and considers that any proposals which 
            undermine or damage this objective are ill-timed, counter-productive

            chemicals campaign; notes with serious concern mounting evidence that 
            suggests that hormone-disrupting chemicals and chemicals that persist 
            and bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife are linked to a range of 
            adverse physiological and mental effects, including effects on reproduction, 
            cancers, genital deformities and neurological and developmental problems; 
            considers that exposure to such chemicals in the environment must 
            be reduced to protect human health and the environment; notes the 
            importance of the Parliament reaching a view on the proposed new European

            endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the phasing out of hazardous and

            with special needs in Aberdeenshire and elsewhere with regard to accessing 
            vital physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy 
            and orthotics; further notes the difficulties of recruiting speech 
            and language therapists in the north east of Scotland and that the 
            speech and language therapy training courses are located in the central 
            belt and are oversubscribed; further notes that those staff currently 
            in place do a tremendous job given the strain that they are being 
            placed under, and considers that the Scottish Executive should (a) 
            make greater funding available for these courses, (b) promote the 
            location of a speech and language therapy training course in the north 
            east, (c) provide funding for training and employment of additional

            livelihoods that these fisheries sustain; further notes that any future 
            expeditions by industrial vessels of this nature will inevitably deplete 
            available stocks to unsustainable levels, and therefore believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should introduce a three-mile exclusion zone 
            for all vessels over 40 feet to cover both of these bays thereby safeguarding 
            both the stocks and the jobs that they sustain.</P>
