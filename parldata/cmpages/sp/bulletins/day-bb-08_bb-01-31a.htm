    <blockquote>

      <p><strong>S3M-1246.1.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Accessible Passenger Transport and the National Concessionary Fares Scheme</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-1246.1) in the name of Patrick Harvie, insert at end &quot;and notes that Labour and Liberal Democrat ministers in the previous administration chose not to grant eligibility to disabled people in receipt of the lower rate of disability allowance and to older and disabled people using community transport in rural areas when they created the National Concessionary Fares Scheme.&quot; </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-1258.1</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1258) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;; notes the SNP&rsquo;s commitment&quot; to end and insert &quot;and the need for energy efficiency, quality design including the incorporation of sound ecological and sustainable design principles, and value for money for the public purse in building schools; recognises the need for the Scottish Government and local authorities to continue to improve Scotland&rsquo;s school estate; notes the SNP&rsquo;s commitment to match the previous administration&rsquo;s proposed school building programme &quot;brick for brick&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a statement to the Parliament detailing its plans for new schools and how these will be funded.&quot; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-1258.1.1</strong> <strong>Maureen Watt: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-1258.1) in the name of Elizabeth Smith, insert at end &quot;and further notes that future plans for school buildings will be usefully informed by the imminent publication of Audit Scotland&rsquo;s report on improving the Scottish school estate and the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals for the Scottish Futures Trust and the Infrastructure Investment Plan.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> <strong>S3M-1258.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1258) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;recognises the publication of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on the Scottish Futures Trust and its support for the use of private finance, and is concerned that the failure of the SNP government to bring forward an alternative funding mechanism and support is causing confusion and uncertainty and is holding back councils across Scotland who want to improve schools in their areas.&quot; </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-1260.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran: Poverty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1260) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;that tackling these challenges&quot; to end and insert &quot;; regrets that the SNP&rsquo;s approach fails to respond to the needs of the poorest households in Scotland and fails to engage those groups experienced in tackling poverty in finding solutions, and believes that social justice is a priority for the Scottish people and should remain a central policy commitment of the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-1260.1</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Poverty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1260) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;recognises that the Scottish Government, UK Government and local governments need to work together to get people off welfare and into work where possible and to increase the percentage of benefit take-up ensuring that those most in need of help get it, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward proposals to achieve these aims.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-765</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Extra-curricular Outdoor Education for Every School Pupil</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vital contribution that taking part in extra-curricular activities makes in developing our young people; notes that extra-curricular programmes help our young people to learn new skills, to enjoy new responsibility, to appreciate the work of other people and to learn about leadership; notes the success of projects such as Crieff High School&rsquo;s Community Awareness Project, and considers that, in an age when too many of our young people are in the headlines for the wrong reasons and when there are increasing concerns about school discipline and the numbers of youngsters involved in incidents of antisocial behaviour, extra-curricular activities in schools and five days outdoor education for every school pupil in Scotland should be supported. </p>
