            Sam Galbraith: Sustainable Development</strong>—That the Parliament affirms 
            its commitment to sustainable development; recognises the importance 
            of sustainable development to achieving social justice for all peoples, 
            and commends the Scottish Executive for continuing to place the issue 
            central to its policies and programmes, as evidenced in its Programme 
            for Government <i>Working together for Scotland</i>.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1693#</strong> <strong>Mr Alex Salmond: Future 
            of Fishing Industry</strong>—That the Parliament notes the decision by 
            Scottish fishing boats to tie-up in port as an attempt to stop the 
            slaughter of juvenile haddock and whiting; recognises that the Cod 
            Recovery Plan in closed fishing areas has forced the fleet into fishing 
            grounds which are teeming with juvenile fish which when caught must 
            be discarded dead back into the sea; further notes that the future 
            of the fishing industry depends on the survival of these juvenile 
            fish; deplores the fact that working fishermen, with mortgages and 
            financial commitments to meet, now apparently care more for the conservation 
            of fish stocks than the Scottish Executive or Her Majesty's Government, 
            and seeks the immediate introduction by the Scottish Executive of 
            a compensation lay-up scheme to allow the industry to move through 
            this difficult period and secure a future for the white fish fisheries.</font></p>
