<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5434</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Israel War Crime Court Action</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of an English court to issue an arrest warrant for the Israeli opposition leader, Tzipi Livni, who was foreign minister at the time of the three-week Israeli assault on Gaza, an attack in which, according to the United Nations, the Israeli Defence Force committed a number of war crimes, including the deliberate and systematic targeting of Palestinian civilians; supports any future arrest warrants being issued against the former Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, and Ehud Barak, the defence minister, and considers that all states, including the United Kingdom, have a duty, under the principle of universal jurisdiction, when dealing with crimes against humanity to pursue war crime suspects and can bring them before English and Scottish courts regardless of whether the crime took place outside their normal legal jurisdiction; welcomes the precedent that this English court decision establishes despite reports that the British Government now plans to introduce new legislation to make Israeli Government ministers immune from such action, and urges relevant groups and organisations to bring similar court proceedings against other individual former US and UK Government ministers, such as George W Bush and Tony Blair, who are suspected of instigating wars in flagrant contravention of international legal mores.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5426#</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Car Parking Charges at HIAL Airports</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the welcome, if belated, decision by Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) to postpone the introduction of car parking charges at Kirkwall Airport; regrets that this decision was taken only after the board of HIAL initially rejected the unanimous recommendation of the statutory Kirkwall Airport Consultative Committee to put the introduction of the charges on hold until a proper consultation was undertaken; further notes that HIAL is considering imposing similar charges at its airports at Sumburgh and Stornoway; is concerned that the introduction of car parking charges at these island airports will add still further to the high cost for island residents of using their lifeline internal and external air services and of island life in general; expects the consultation to be thorough and to enable the detail of HIAL&rsquo;s proposals, as well as the principle of charging, to be robustly challenged, and considers that the delay offers the opportunity for all Orcadians to make their views known and for islanders from Shetland and the Western Isles to add their voices to the campaign against the Kirkwall charges in order to avoid a precedent being set at Kirkwall, which HIAL could use to impose charges at Sumburgh and Stornoway.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5425</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Tony Blair Finally Reveals the Truth on Iraq</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recalls that the House of Commons voted in favour of the United Kingdom participating in the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 based on the premise that the Iraqi Government possessed weapons of mass destruction despite it being the case that UN weapons inspectors in Iraq had found no such weapons in the period before the invasion, that many people at the time considered it unlikely that any such weapons existed and that no such weapons have been found since the invasion; further recalls that this invasion took place in the face of significant domestic and international opposition to war; considers that the war in Iraq has led to the deaths of hundreds of coalition combatants and tens of thousands of civilians as well as unleashing previously unknown sectarian and political terrorism in Iraq; further considers that the recent revelation by Tony Blair that he would have supported military intervention in Iraq regardless of whether or not the Iraqi regime possessed weapons of mass destruction is telling in the extreme and suggests that those arguments that the regime did possess such weapons were no more than a charade used to justify an already-decided-on invasion that was more to do with Western political and economic interests than it ever was about removing any tangible threat posed to the UK or US by Iraq; believes that the actions of George Bush&rsquo;s &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; in Iraq have served only to destabilise the world; notes the body of legal opinion that suggests that the invasion was illegal, and believes that this opinion should be put to the test by having those leaders who authorised the invasion tried before internationally recognised courts for their alleged criminality.</p>
