            <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: School Milk</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern that almost one third of children go to school without breakfast; 
            recognises the importance of the provision of subsidised school milk 
            in providing children with essential calories, vitamins, proteins 
            and minerals; welcomes the decision by the EU to fund school milk 
            at 75% of the target milk price; supports provision of the necessary 
            top-up funding of an estimated £380,000 in Scotland to ensure the 
            maintenance of the current level of subsidy for school milk in primary 
            schools, and further calls for reintroduction of school milk in secondary 
            schools in order to fulfil the Labour Party's 1997 manifesto pledge.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1264</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: 
            Scotland's Participation in Future Olympic Games</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates all British participants in the recent Sydney Olympic 
            Games; is pleased that the number of gold medals won by the Great 
            Britain team was the highest for 80 years; is aware that Cuba won 
            the same number of gold medals as Britain, as did Romania, while the 
            Netherlands won 12, despite these countries having less than a fifth, 
            a third and a quarter of Great Britain's population; realises that 
            Great Britain came only thirtieth in terms of per capita success; 
            believes that this is due to continued underfunding of sport relative 
            to other countries, resulting for example in Britain having only eight 
            Olympic sized swimming pools compared with 1,500 in Australia, which 
            has a population only a third of the size of Britain's; notes that 
            the 199 countries participating excluded one of Europe's oldest nations, 
            Scotland; notes that while most national Olympic Committees are from 
            nations, the International Olympic Committee also recognises independent 
            territories, commonwealths, protectorates and geographical areas and 
            that therefore, despite the Minister for Children and Education's 
            statement on 28 September 2000 (<i>Official Report,</i> col. 792-3), 
            there is not necessarily only a single recognised Olympic committee 
            for each independent nation state; is pleased that American Samoa, 
            Aruba, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, 
            Guam, Hong Kong, Netherlands Antilles, Palestine, Puerto Rico and 
            US Virgin Islands all entered teams in the Olympics despite their 
            non-independent status; recognises that Scotland competes in the cricket, 
            football and rugby union world cups and Commonwealth Games in its 
            own right; believes that Scotland should compete in the Athens and 
            subsequent Olympic Games in its own right, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to work to that end.</font></p>

            that the company serves; acknowledges the importance of these jobs 
            to the economic well-being of these remote and island communities; 
            notes with concern the fears that employees of Caledonian MacBrayne 
            have regarding the potential consequences of the competitive tendering 
            process required by the European Commission, and urges the Scottish 
            Executive to do everything within its power to ensure that job security

            of the City and calls upon Aberdeen City Council to reconsider this

            an annual Scottish Parliament bursary which would enable artists and

            (SAC) made during the last year under Natura 2000 and covering more 
            than 8% of Scotland's landmass; notes that the position is modest 
            when compared with, for example, Denmark which has over 22% of its 
            land designated as SPAs and Finland where 14% of its land is proposed 
            as an SAC; asks the Scottish Executive to confirm the scientific basis 
            for these designations, which are selected according to European law; 
            further notes that future European funding will be targeted at such 
            Natura 2000 sites, and therefore regrets the relatively small designation 
            rate in Scotland given our outstanding natural heritage and the opportunity
