<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#fend">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5280#</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Rise in Alcohol-Related Crime Figures in the Highlands and Islands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the serious rise in alcohol-related crime figures, released by Northern Constabulary, which show a year-on-year increase in drunkenness, drink-driving, serious assaults and alcohol-related deaths; notes in particular the increase in the number of people being arrested for drunkenness, including the charge of being drunk and incapable; commends the work of CrossReach in Inverness, which provides a purpose-built residential service designed to care for people who have difficulty in managing their alcohol and/or drug abuse and which also provides a &quot;designated place&quot;, thereby offering an alternative to custody for those who have been arrested for public drunkenness offences; welcomes the campaign being launched by Northern Constabulary alongside the Highland Drug and Alcohol Action Team&rsquo;s festive drinking campaign which it is hoped will prevent drinkers ending up in police cells and hospital wards over Christmas and New Year, and endorses the &quot;Don&rsquo;t push it&quot; campaign being run by the Scottish Executive asking Scots to take responsibility for themselves and to think first before they encourage others to have &quot;just another drink&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5279</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Marilyn Livingstone be appointed to replace Ms Wendy Alexander as the Labour Party substitute on the European and External Relations Committee.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5273</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Parliament Cr&egrave;che in Danger</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regretfully notes the recent liquidation of KidCare, the Parliament&rsquo;s cr&egrave;che provider, and the current closure of the service; acknowledges the very difficult situation in which this development places the Parliament&rsquo;s cr&egrave;che facility and its team of dedicated staff; strongly supports the family-friendly founding principles of the Parliament and believes that the continuing provision of suitable childcare facilities is essential if these principles are to be upheld, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to do everything in its power to ensure the continuity of the cr&egrave;che facility and retention of its staff in the immediate short term and the continued provision of childcare facilities in the long term.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5272</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Victory for Militant Trade Union Action at Glasgow City Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates UNISON members in Glasgow City Council for the substantial victory they have achieved after the council caved in on the eve of a planned three-day strike which would have been the biggest conflict it faced with trade unionists in several years; notes that the negotiated agreement means that the union has won a settlement that amounts to indefinite or lifetime protection of current salaries, that is that either people will be retrained or their jobs will be redesigned to guarantee them their current pay by March 2009 or that deadline will be extended indefinitely until such time as these devices kick in; recognises that the Culture and Leisure Services Department is still threatened by a proposal that it will be hived off to a charitable trust which would mean only one year&rsquo;s protection under TUPE rules, and further notes that women underpaid for decades have still not achieved full compensation to the value of potential equal pay claims but, in so doing, recognises that this victory strengthens the trade union and its members and will enable them to organise and achieve fair and equal terms and conditions in the future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Colin Fox<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5271</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Focus Environment 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the children throughout Scotland who participated in this year&rsquo;s Focus Environment competition; notes that Focus Environment, sponsored by Chevron Upstream Europe in partnership with the Scottish Wildlife Trust and British Trust for Conservation Volunteers Scotland, is an environmental photography competition open to secondary school pupils throughout Scotland which aims to encourage young people to demonstrate their awareness of the natural world around them by applying imagination, a creative eye and photographic skills; further notes the efforts and high standard of the work from all of the competition participants, and urges all who can to view the work of the competition winners while on display in the Scottish Parliament in the first week of December.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5270</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Meter Relief</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Scottish Gas to end the practice of back charging token prepayment meter customers; notes that only three of the six main suppliers, Scottish Power, npower and Powergen, continue a practice which forces low income consumers into debt as a result of these suppliers&rsquo; failure to reset meters after a price rise, and calls on these companies to follow Scottish Gas by announcing an immediate end to back charging.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5269.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Civic Participation - Trade Union Engagement with Scotland&rsquo;s Civic Society</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5269) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;its&quot; to end and insert &quot;a partnership with civic Scotland, but stresses that such a partnership should be on as wide a basis as possible including the private sector and business and enterprise groups in order that a more balanced approach be taken towards the governance of Scotland and the achievement of social justice.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5269.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Civic Participation - Trade Union Engagement with Scotland&rsquo;s Civic Society</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5269) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, insert at end &quot;and, towards the aim of real and meaningful engagement with the trade union movement in Scotland, resolves to publicly encourage employees to consider trade union membership in all areas of employment and to implement trade union recognition audits of all companies and bodies which seek public contracts, grants or employment aid to ensure that only the best employers who recognise trade unions are entitled to benefit from public money in whatever form.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5269.3</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Civic Participation - Trade Union Engagement with Scotland&rsquo;s Civic Society</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5269) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;strength&quot; to end and insert &quot;important part that free independent trade unions play in civic Scotland today; welcomes the Scottish Trades Union Congress&rsquo;s (STUC) role over many years in promoting trade union values and the interests of working people in Scotland on a wide variety of matters such as job protection, pay and conditions, health and safety and equal opportunities; welcomes the STUC&rsquo;s information week at the Parliament, and recognises the just cause of the workers at McKinnon Mills in Coatbridge and public sector workers across Scotland seeking to secure their right to equal pay for work of equal value.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5261*#*</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Success of Scots Trad Music Awards 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hands Up For Trad, its founder Simon Thoumire of Footstompin&rsquo; Records and the sponsors and supporters who made the 2006 awards ceremony and weekend entertainment in Fort William such a happy and successful gathering; draws particular attention to the staff of the Nevis Centre whose hard work allowed the annual event to move from its Edinburgh base and offer a top-class venue, a friendly Highland welcome and a tremendous warm-up for the major events to be staged there in 2007 during the Scottish Year of Highland Culture; offers congratulations to winners of a wide range of awards, voted on by thousands across the globe, that give significant recognition to the excellence within Scotland&rsquo;s thriving contemporary traditional music scene; encourages the funding bodies to invest in this success which promotes, through composition, performance and enthusiastic audience response, such a positive message about Scottish cultural confidence, and believes that Scotland&rsquo;s television media should build on BBC Radio Scotland&rsquo;s role as the sole consistent champion of our Scottish music and traditions by broadcasting the images and sounds round the world.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5258.1</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Council Tax</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5258) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;a 50% discount&quot; to end and insert &quot;the council tax to be abolished and replaced by a local income tax based on the ability to pay.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5258.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Council Tax</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5258) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;a 50% discount&quot; to end and insert &quot;the unfair Tory council tax to be scrapped and replaced with a progressive and fair income-based alternative in order to tax the well-paid and wealthy more and the low-paid and pensioners less and effect a significant redistribution of income from those with most towards those with least, thereby improving social justice and economic activity across Scotland, and condemns those political parties such as the SNP and Liberal Democrats who promote opposition to the council tax publicly but who refused to support scrapping it on 1 February 2006 when they failed to vote for the Council Tax Abolition and Service Tax Introduction (Scotland) Bill.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5258.3</strong> <strong>George Lyon:</strong> <strong>Council Tax</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5258) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from &quot;the recommendations&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the Scottish Executive established the independent inquiry into local government finance consistent with the Partnership Agreement of May 2003; notes that individuals and political parties made representations to this inquiry which published its findings in November 2006, and notes that the Executive will consider the report in its entirety and will respond to the committee&rsquo;s findings in due course.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5235*#*</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Scottish Power Takeover</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should issue a statement setting out its position in response to Iberdrola&rsquo;s proposed takeover of Scottish Power; expresses concern that Scotland&rsquo;s fourth-largest company may pass into foreign ownership without real debate about the effect this will have on jobs at the Glasgow headquarters, energy prices and the Scottish economy, and therefore believes that a Parliamentary debate on the issue should take place at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
