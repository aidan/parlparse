            Act 1997 (Enhanced Criminal Record Certificates) (Protection of Vulnerable 
            Adults) (Scotland) Regulations 2002</strong>&#151;That the Justice 
            2 Committee recommends that the draft Police Act 1997 (Enhanced Criminal 
            Record Certificates) (Protection of Vulnerable Adults) (Scotland) 
            Regulations 2002 be approved.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2933</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Alain Baxter</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament condemns the International Olympic Committee (IOC) 
            for its failure to institute a standard of testing methamphetamine 
            in Alain Baxter&#146;s test sample which would have shown conclusively 
            that the Olympic Bronze medallist did not enhance his performance 
            in the Winter Olympics by the illegal use of the stimulant d-methamphetamine 
            but that the nasal spray which caused amphetamine to be registered 
            in his test contained l-methamphetamine which is acknowledged by Professor 
            Arnold Beckett, formerly a member of the IOC medical commission, to 
            be a non-stimulant which would have had no effect whatsoever on Alain 
            Baxter&#146;s performance, and therefore urges the IOC to re-instate 
            Alain Baxter&#146;s Olympic medal.</p>

            of Flower Arrangers</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the 
            visit to Scotland by the World Association of Flower Arrangers, congratulates 
            the City of Glasgow and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre 
            on hosting the seventh World Flower Show (Floramondi) which is scheduled 
            to take place from Thursday 13 to Sunday 16 June 2002 and wishes this 
            prestigious event every success; further congratulates the organisers 
            for securing over 200 trade stands and selling over 20,000 tickets; 
            acknowledges that this showcase for the World Association of Flower 
            Arrangers is also a major opportunity to boost tourism in both the 
            City of Glasgow and throughout Scotland, and notes the support of 
            the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Valley Tourist Board and Scottish Enterprise 
            Glasgow in helping to sponsor and promote this memorable event.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2931#</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Parkinson's Awareness 
            Week</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges Parkinson&#146;s 
            Awareness Week, 8-14 April 2002; recognises the impact Parkinson&#146;s 
            Disease has on 12,000 people in Scotland as well as their families, 
            friends and carers; congratulates the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society 
            on raising awareness of this degenerative and debilitating condition; 
            notes the serious difficulties often caused by the lack of awareness 
            of the impact of Parkinson&#146;s Disease, particularly with regard 
            to its prevalence in younger people, the fluctuations in symptoms 
            and also the importance of the timing of medication; applauds the 
            Society&#146;s education programme to deliver essential information 
            and advice to a wide range of professionals, organisations and individuals, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should give priority status 
            to neurological and other long term conditions, promote better understanding 
            throughout the healthcare professions and continue to address the 
            variation in standards and access to services across the country through 
            a National Service Framework for Neurological Conditions in close 
            consultation with people with Parkinson&#146;s Disease and other specialists 
            in the field.</p>

            Mr Keith Harding <strong><em>R</em></strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2930</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Inverness Air Links 
            - Public Service Obligation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the huge significance of direct links between Inverness Airport and 
            London hub airports to the economic and social well-being of the Highlands 
            and Islands, particularly in relation to tourism, exports, the business 
            economy and employment; notes that the peripherality of Inverness 
            and the dependence of the Highlands on air transport are unusual in 
            UK terms and that other transport links from the north of Scotland 
            cannot provide an adequate substitute for the established air links; 
            believes that the absence of a fast alternative adds weight to the 
            case for the imposition of a Public Service Obligation (PSO) which 
            would allow the ring-fencing of the Gatwick slots, which is necessary 
            for the continued operation of the service; further believes that 
            early implementation of a PSO is crucial, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to press further the case for a PSO with the Department 
            for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and press for that 
            Department to approach the European Commission on this matter as was 
            done by the previous Minister for Transport and Planning.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2926#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Teenage Cancer 
            Trust - Beatson Oncology Unit</strong>&#151;That the Parliament pledges 
            its support to the campaign to raise £750,000 for the first ever specialist 
            teenage cancer ward to be set up in Scotland by the Teenage Cancer 
            Trust at the Beatson Oncology Unit in Glasgow.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2925</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Ethical Threads</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the introduction of the &quot;Ethical Threads&quot; 
            branding; notes that tee-shirts carrying the brand are sourced from 
            ethically sound companies and co-operatives that employ good labour 
            practices, provide safe and hygienic working conditions and pay workers 
            a living wage; further notes that the vast majority of tee-shirts 
            currently sold in the music merchandising sector are produced by sweatshop 
            labour, and therefore calls on the musical artists and promotion companies 
            of Scotland to adopt the Ethical Threads trademark as a means of insisting 
            that sweatshop exploitation plays no further part in the music merchandising 
            business.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2924</strong> <strong>Ian Jenkins: Bill McLaren</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates Bill McLaren on his remarkable career 
            in broadcasting as the unmistakable voice of rugby football, a career 
            spanning fifty years in the course of which he has become recognised 
            as a much admired ambassador for rugby, for Scotland and for the Borders.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2917#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith: In-House Provision 
            of Public Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust on its decision to transfer 
            porters and domestic staff at Stobhill Hospital, previously outsourced, 
            back into the employment of the NHS trust on 1 May 2002; further congratulates 
            UNISON on its &quot;Positively Public&quot; campaign, which includes 
            support for the principle of having public services of the highest 
            quality provided by an in-house team, and believes that the in-house 
            model of public service provision should be extended right across 
            Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John McAllion</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2916</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Launch of Burnbrae 
            Primary School Drug Free Zone</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            Burnbrae Primary School on becoming a drug-free zone; notes the hard 
            work of the Task Force, which was entirely made up of pupils, in making 
            it happen; applauds the staff, parents, pupils, police, Glasgow City 
            Council and Scotland Against Drugs for the commitment shown in participating 
            in this initiative, and urges the Scottish Executive and the appropriate 
            committees of the Parliament to do all they can to promote initiatives 
            such as this, which place young people at the centre of the process 
            and empower them to make positive choices in their lives.</p>

            out from second &quot;that&quot; to end and insert &quot;, with grave 
            concern, that the Scottish Executive has approved the planting of 
            a GM oilseed rape crop at three trial sites in Scotland this spring 
            and encourages ministers to take full responsibility for Scotland&#146;s 
            environment by using the devolved powers available to them to reverse 
            their environmentally-damaging decision.&quot;</a> </p>

            the killing of 167 men in the Piper Alpha disaster which was the result 
            of the negligence of the Occidental Oil Company, as clearly demonstrated 
            by the Public Inquiry into the disaster; notes that there has never 
            been a parliamentary inquiry into the Crown Office&#146;s decision 
            not to prosecute in this case, and therefore calls for such an inquiry 
            into that decision.</p>
