            Accountability</strong>-That the Parliament notes that there is widespread 
            public misunderstanding of who is responsible for what in terms of 
            policing in Scotland; recognises that there needs to be greater local 
            involvement in policing along with a police service that is more responsive 
            to public demands, and calls on the Scottish Executive to strengthen 
            public accountability and involvement by considering ideas such as 
            the direct election of conveners of police boards and the regular 
            publication of localised crime statistics. </P>

              the Scottish Executive's commitment to work for a safer Scotland

              community accountability for policing through local police boards; 
              endorses its promotion of responsiveness to local communities through 
              police boards' duty to secure Best Value and to report to the public 
              on performance, and welcomes its policy of Community Planning which 
              is enabling police forces to improve the delivery of services to 
              local communities through more effective collaboration with other 
              public bodies.&quot;</p>

            out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the 
            public's concern about policing is less about the lack of police accountability 
            and more about the lack of police officers; calls for an overall increase 
            in the number of police officers to take account of the fact that 
            many more are now engaged in specialist activity, rather than community 
            policing; recognises the right of the police to set local priorities 
            free from political interference; encourages an intensive targeting 
            of crime hotspots, low-level offending that nevertheless impinges 
            on the quality of life in communities and persistent offenders who 
            account for a disproportionate amount of crime, but urges all those 
            involved in the criminal justice system not to lose sight of the fact 
            that it is serious violent crime that is on the increase in Scotland.&quot;

            consistent underperformance of the Scottish economy relative to that 
            of the UK as a whole; recognises that the burdens of higher rates, 
            water charges and regulation faced by businesses in Scotland are factors 
            contributing to this underperformance, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to take immediate steps to create a more business friendly 
            environment by reducing business rates and water charges and cutting 
            red tape, thereby encouraging business development, improving the 
            outlook for economic growth, and contributing to a reverse in Scotland's

            Scotch whisky industry; believes that the case for a tax stamp system 
            is not proven and that it would be an ineffective means of combating 
            fraud and illicit trade while imposing substantial costs and practical 
            problems on the industry, particularly in relation to labelling and 
            storage; notes the Scottish Executive's Scotch whisky framework which 
            supports a fair taxation regime for Scotch whisky, and therefore believes 
            that the Executive should make representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            against the introduction of tax stamps or any similar burdens on the 
            Scotch whisky industry. </P>
