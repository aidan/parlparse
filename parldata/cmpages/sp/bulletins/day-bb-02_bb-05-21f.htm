          <p><strong>*S1M-3136</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Royal Opening of 
            Millennium Wheel, Falkirk</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            British Waterways, Falkirk Council and all the organisations and people 
            who contributed to the creation and building of the Falkirk Millennium 
            Wheel, which is a testament to Scotland's well-renowned and innovative 
            engineering skills. and welcomes Her Majesty the Queen, who will officially 
            open the Wheel on 24 May 2002, and whose presence is an indication 
            of the significance of this imaginative project as a new landmark 
            in central Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3135</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Volunteers Week 
            2002</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the efforts of Volunteer 
            Development Scotland to encourage people to be volunteers during this 
            year's Volunteers Week from 7 to 13 June 2002; congratulates and welcomes 
            those who will be volunteering for the first time during that week; 
            appreciates that very many of those volunteering will already be regular 
            and committed volunteers who support individuals and communities in 
            many indispensable ways, and commends the valuable contribution to 
            Scottish life and communities made by volunteers from all walks of 
            society.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3134</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson: Transfers Under 
            PFI/PPP - Protection of Staff Rights and Conditions</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">recognises concerns expressed 
            by many employees, trade union members, commentators and concerned 
            citizens about the operation of PFI/PPP contracts initiated by the 
            public sector in Scotland; acknowledges that these concerns are based 
            on a number of factors, including the excessive cost of capital provided, 
            the quality of public service provided and the rights and conditions 
            of staff employed under PFI/PPP contracts; further recognises that 
            many of the alleged efficiency gains in PFI/PPP contracts in comparison 
            to the public sector are made at the expense of staff rights and conditions, 
            which, in turn, can have a significant negative impact on the quality 
            of ongoing service; further recognises that there is growing concern 
            that the rights and conditions of employees transferred out of the 
            public sector in Scotland through PFI/PPP deals are less favourably 
            protected than elsewhere in the UK; resolves that any future PFI/PPP 
            contracts should make the detail of alleged efficiency savings publicly 
            available and specify the impact that such savings have on staff rights 
            and conditions so that public bodies entering into such agreements 
            are fully accountable to the people that they serve, and further resolves 
            that, in respect of employee transfers under the TUPE regulations 
            from public bodies for which the Scottish Executive has any responsibility, 
            transfer practice should adhere to the Cabinet Office Statement of 
            Practice as a minimum standard.</a></p>
