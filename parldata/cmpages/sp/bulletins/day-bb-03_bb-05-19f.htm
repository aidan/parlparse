          <p><strong>S2M-34#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Closure of Animal 
            Welfare Centres</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned about 
            the possible closure of at least seven of the 13 animal welfare centres 
            across Scotland owing to financial difficulties being experienced 
            by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA); 
            believes that this would be detrimental to animal welfare; notes with 
            relief that the SSPCA board of management has postponed making a final 
            decision on the closures of the centres for a further six months, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should hold urgent discussions 
            with the SSPCA to try to find a way of keeping the animal welfare 
            centres open.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-32</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson: Recognition of 
            the Role of Nursery Nurses</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the important and expanding role of nursery nurses in the pre-five 
            sector; further recognises the demands placed on nursery nurses in 
            ensuring continual professional development to meet registration requirements, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive to work with COSLA to reach 
            agreement with UNISON on behalf of nursery nurses.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-31#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Glasgow and Edinburgh 
            Airports Investment</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the response 
            by BAA plc to Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s consultation document, 
            <em>The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: 
            A National Consultation &#150; Scotland,</em> which states that the 
            upgrading of Glasgow Airport to international hub status would cost 
            £1.1 billion, £200 million less than government estimates, and that 
            the cost of upgrading Edinburgh Airport would be £1.3 billion, £400 
            million more than previous estimates; further notes the massive investment 
            planned for airport expansion in the south east of England; expresses 
            its support for Scottish Airports Ltd&#146;s call on Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government not to put Scotland&#146;s long-term economical prospects 
            at risk by opting to develop only one of the country&#146;s main airports, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations 
            to Her Majesty&#146;s Government to ensure that the necessary investment 
            is made available to ensure that both airports grow to their full 
            potential.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-30</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Broomhill Day Centre, 
            Penicuik</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the excellent and 
            consistent standard of care provided by the Broomhill Day Centre in 
            Penicuik; commends the dedicated staff and volunteers for their work 
            over many years in establishing the centre as an example of high quality 
            day care facilities in Scotland; is concerned at the precarious nature 
            of its funding for 2003-04 which could jeopardise this standard of 
            care, and calls on all funding bodies to ensure that the centre&#146;s 
            funding is secure.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-29</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: Threatened Execution 
            of Amina Lawal</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with horror 
            that the Nigerian Supreme Court has upheld the death sentence for 
            Amina Lawal, condemned for the crime of adultery on 19 August 2002, 
            to be buried up to her neck and stoned to death; further notes that 
            this sentence was postponed so that she could continue to nurse her 
            baby but that execution is now set for 3 June 2003; calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to make urgent representations to Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to ask it to intervene with the Nigerian Government to prevent this 
            atrocity, and believes that Nigeria cannot remain part of the Commonwealth 
            and international community if it enforces this sentence.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, Frances Curran, Robin Harper, Ms Sandra 
            White, Tommy Sheridan, Ms Rosemary Byrne</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-28</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Deportation of Ali 
            Serir</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the case of Ali Serir, 
            an Algerian asylum seeker threatened with deportation to Algeria on 
            Friday 16 May 2003; further notes that Ali is married to Karen from 
            Glasgow and has lived in Royston, Glasgow, for the last 18 months 
            and that Karen is expecting their first child in August; condemns 
            the way Ali and Karen were forcibly removed from their home at 5.20am 
            on 6 February 2003 under an anti-terrorist investigation where no 
            charges were made or are pending, and believes that Ali should be 
            granted asylum to live with his wife and child in Glasgow as his life 
            would be in danger if he returned to Algeria, given the very adverse 
            publicity that has now been generated over his arrest and detention.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, Ms Sandra White, Ms Rosemary Byrne</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-27</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Fire Service Dispute</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament applauds the professionalism of Scotland&#146;s fire 
            service personnel who deliver daily a first-class service to Scotland&#146;s 
            citizens; supports the right of free trade unions to negotiate and 
            bargain on behalf of their members and to engage democratically in 
            collective action up to, and including, strike action; rejects any 
            plan to impose a settlement of the current fire service dispute as 
            a profoundly undemocratic and provocative action unacceptable in a 
            modern democracy, and believes that the finance must be found to reward 
            properly the fire service personnel for the essential job they do 
            without reducing the quality and resources of the service.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, Ms Rosemary Byrne</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-26</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Bed Shortages in 
            Glasgow Hospitals</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the survey 
            conducted by Greater Glasgow Health Council which exposed the unacceptable 
            delays that citizens in Glasgow are forced to endure as a direct result 
            of hospital bed shortages throughout the city; further notes that 
            the examples highlighted in the survey included an 81-year-old man 
            kept waiting in the accident and emergency department for five hours 
            for access to a bed after treatment at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and 
            a 91-year-old women kept waiting for four hours for a bed after treatment 
            at Glasgow&#146;s Southern General Hospital; believes that records 
            to detail every person&#146;s visit to an accident and emergency department 
            in Glasgow and across Scotland must be introduced immediately and 
            that no reduction in overnight or acute beds can be afforded in Glasgow 
            without an emergency investigation of the bed shortage problem, and 
            therefore calls for all plans to reduce the availability of acute 
            and overnight beds at the Stobhill and Victoria hospitals to be halted 
            immediately pending an emergency short-term investigation of the number 
            of acute beds required in the city.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, Ms Rosemary Byrne</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-25</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Income Inequality 
            Under New Labour</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the latest 
            statistics from the Office for National Statistics that reveal that 
            income under the New Labour governments is worse than under Margaret 
            Thatcher&#146;s governments from 1979 to 1990; further notes that 
            inequality has grown sharply under New Labour as a direct result of 
            its unwillingness to tax appropriately Britain&#146;s growing band 
            of millionaires and high earners; is aware that the latest figures 
            show that inequality under New Labour is, on average, one sixth higher 
            than the equivalent average under the 11-year government of Margaret 
            Thatcher and 10 per cent higher than under the Conservatives&#146; 
            18-year rule as a whole, and calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to introduce immediately a wealth redistribution package involving 
            higher taxes for the wealthy and millionaires, combined with a living 
            minimum wage, significantly improved benefits and a basic state pension 
            of £150 a week without means testing.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, Ms Rosemary Byrne</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-24</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Service 
            Tax</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the inherently unfair 
            nature of the Conservatives&#146; council tax and believes that its 
            ten-year existence has effected a wealth transfusion to the rich and 
            wealthy from pensioners and low-paid workers; believes that a fair 
            system to fund essential local government jobs and services must be 
            introduced urgently to shift the burden of payment for local services 
            from those least able to pay to those most able to pay, and therefore 
            resolves to introduce a personal income-based tax to pay for local 
            government jobs and services applied progressively and practically 
            across Scotland as a priority designed to improve the disposable income 
            of pensioners and ordinary workers while raising more revenue for 
            local services.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, Ms Rosemary Byrne</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-23</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Nursery Nurses Regrading</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament supports the nursery nurses in their campaign for the 
            regrading of their annual pay from a current maximum possible annual 
            salary of £13,800 to £17,000 in recognition of the crucial expertise 
            and training required to provide pre-school children with education 
            and social skills; recognises that nursery nurses represent a low-paid 
            female workforce whose skills have been undervalued for far too long, 
            and calls on COSLA to agree to the nursery nurses&#146; justified 
            regrading claim which UNISON has been pursuing on behalf of nursery 
            nurses for almost two years.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan, Ms Rosemary Byrne</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-22</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Epilepsy Scotland 
            Free Helpline</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the launch 
            of the Epilepsy Scotland free helpline as the precursor to Epilepsy 
            Awareness Week from 18 to 24 May 2003; recognises the valuable role 
            that the helpline will provide in helping the 30,000 families living 
            with epilepsy and their carers to have better access to support and 
            information, and further recognises the important work of Epilepsy 
            Scotland in advocating on behalf of, and working with, Scottish families 
            affected by epilepsy.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper, Carolyn Leckie, Ms Sandra White</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-21</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: Cancellation of Iraq's 
            Debt</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that under Saddam Hussein&#146;s 
            regime Iraq accumulated almost $400 billion of debt and reparation 
            claims; welcomes the Jubilee Iraq organisation&#146;s call for cancellation 
            of these financial obligations so that the new democratic government 
            promised in Iraq, and the Iraqi people, are not made to pay the bill 
            for the wars and oppression they suffered under Saddam Hussein&#146;s 
            government; believes that the next government of Iraq should in reciprocation 
            cancel debts owed to Iraq by highly indebted poor countries, and encourages 
            the United Nations and the governments of the United States of America 
            and United Kingdom to use their influence with creditors and their 
            authority to achieve this objective.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-20#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: 30th Anniversary 
            of Seafield Pit Disaster</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            10 May 2003 was the 30th Anniversary of the Seafield pit disaster; 
            acknowledges the efforts of the Fife Miners Cultural Group in ensuring 
            that the anniversary was commemorated with the unveiling of a plaque 
            to the five miners who died; recognises the tireless work done by 
            the group in preserving and promoting Fife's mining heritage, and 
            congratulates the group on the creation of the Mining Heritage Centre 
            in Kinglassie.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Ms Sandra White, Scott Barrie</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-19#</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Firefighters' Dispute</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that the firefighters' dispute remains unresolved; 
            supports the continued right to strike for an improvement in pay and 
            conditions; further notes the position of Her Majesty's Government 
            which allows for a pay settlement to be imposed by legislation; opposes 
            such an imposition and any proposal for legislation in the Scottish 
            Parliament intended to achieve that, and calls for meaningful talks 
            to be resumed as soon as possible ensuring a fair settlement for firefighters 
            with no detriment to the delivery of fire services to the general 
            public and for any change to future bargaining arrangements to be 
            the subject of consultation and negotiation with the Fire Brigades 
            Union, the STUC and other relevant parties.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-18</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes: M74 Northern Extension</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the proposed extension of the M74 motorway; 
            notes the potential economic benefits of completing Scotland&#146;s 
            "missing link", including the creation and safeguarding of thousands 
            of jobs; acknowledges that the construction of the M74 northern extension 
            will reduce traffic in urban areas such as Rutherglen Main Street 
            by up to 70%, and urges the Scottish Executive and the relevant local 
            authorities to ensure that this extension is completed as soon as 
            possible.</p>

            the Parliament endorses the decision of the Scottish Executive to 
            move the headquarters of Scottish Natural Heritage to Inverness; looks 
            forward to the further devolution of government departments and agencies 
            well away from the capital, to the benefit of Scotland as a whole; 
            recognises that the process of devolution away from Edinburgh is very 
            difficult for employees, and calls for all necessary support to be 
            made available to ease moves to other parts of the country, now and 
            in the future.</p>

            expresses grave concern regarding the proposals for change at the 
            Scottish Agricultural College; regrets that these proposals run contrary 
            to the policy of jobs dispersal and undermine widening access to further 
            and higher education, and considers that the matter should be referred 
            urgently to the appropriate committees of the Parliament so that an 
            inquiry may be held.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-15</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Dumfries and Galloway 
            Standard - Local Newspaper of the Year 2003</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament recognises the importance of local newspapers not only 
            in providing information to their communities but also in highlighting

            campaigns run by the <em>Dumfries and Galloway Standard</em>, including 
            its current "Joining Forces" campaign with Dumfries and Galloway Police, 
            and congratulates the newspaper's editor, news team and production

          <p><strong>S2M-14</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: M74 Northern Extension</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament expresses its complete opposition to the M74 Northern 
            Extension; recognises that the process by which this proposal has 
            been pursued, the monies already spent and the estimated cost of the 
            project have failed the people of Glasgow; condemns the Scottish Executive's 
            lack of provision of an alternative public transport system for this 
            part of Glasgow and its apparent disregard for local concerns and 
            needs; calls on the Executive to review its transport policy so that 
            it properly reflects the needs and desires of the Scottish people, 
            and, in the case of the M74 extension, calls for an immediate public 
            inquiry including an environmental impact assessment and proper exploration 
            of alternative options.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-13#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: A9</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the dangers of the A9 trunk road between 
            Perth and Inverness and, in particular, the confusion to motorists 
            caused by switching between dual and single carriageway, which adds 
            to the accident statistics; notes the support of Tayside Police for 
            the dualling of the A9 in its entirety with improved junctions and 
            adequate rest areas in the interests of road safety; further notes 
            the increase in traffic year-on-year on the A9, which has been assisted 
            by economic growth in the Inverness area, and therefore supports the 
            calls from local campaigners for the Scottish Executive to make a 
            commitment to a programme of dualling the A9 between Perth and Inverness.</p>

            an amendment to motion (S2M-13) in the name of Murdo Fraser, insert 
            at end &quot;further recognises that the A9 does not finish at Inverness; 
            welcomes the improvements committed for the A9 at the Ord of Caithness; 
            believes that important work needs to be done to upgrade the road 
            north of Inverness to an acceptable single carriageway standard, and 
            urges the Executive to conduct a safety analysis of the A9 from Perth 
            to Thurso in order to prioritise further improvements.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-12</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: South Lanarkshire 
            Council Secondary School Public Private Partnership Proposal and Hamilton</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament shares the concerns of parents and pupils in Hamilton 
            regarding the public private partnership secondary school proposal 
            of South Lanarkshire Council which, if implemented, will mean the 
            closure of Earnock High School; notes that local residents feel so 
            strongly with regard to the closure of this school that they have 
            elected two independent &quot;save our schools&quot; councillors to 
            the council; further notes the concern of parents in Hamilton that 
            the council's consultation process is inadequate, and calls on the 
            council and the Minister for Finance and Public Services, in consideration 
            of the local community's deep-felt anxiety on this issue, to reconsider 
            this deeply flawed proposal.</p>

            Kilbride</strong>&#151;That the Parliament shares the concerns of 
            parents and pupils in East Kilbride regarding the public private partnership 
            secondary school proposal of South Lanarkshire Council which, if implemented, 
            would mean that 75% of resultant school closures will be in East Kilbride, 
            which will also lose 50% of its secondary schools resulting in school 
            rolls becoming amongst the highest in Scotland, and that the locations 
            of the proposed schools will entail considerably longer school journey 
            times for many pupils; notes that the council's financial proposal 
            is underpinned by the closure of St Bride's School, academically the 
            highest performing school in South Lanarkshire, so that its site can 
            be sold for development; further notes the concern of parents in East 
            Kilbride that the consultation process by the council is inadequate, 
            and calls on the council and the Minister for Finance and Public Services,

          <p><strong>S2M-10#</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Scottish Agricultural 
            College</strong>&#151;That the Parliament views with concern the plans 
            by the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) board to move the college's 
            teaching and research services from Auchincruive, Ayrshire and Craibstone, 
            Aberdeen to Edinburgh; believes that there should be a full economic 
            impact assessment that takes into account the effect that this move 
            would have on students, staff and local communities before the proposal 
            is approved by the Scottish Executive; questions the methodology used 
            by the consultants in their review and report, and considers that 
            there should be a halt to the movement of staff from the SAC campuses 
            in Ayrshire and Aberdeen to Edinburgh, which runs contrary to the 
            Scottish Executive's policy of dispersing agency and department jobs 
            and offices outwith the central belt, until proper scrutiny is carried 
            out by the Parliament and its committees.</p>

            steering committee and supporters for presenting a festival of Burns 
            in a way that not only induces considerable public acclaim and interest

            of service delivery that is both operationally and financially sustainable 
            for the whole of Scotland; recognises the importance of maintaining 
            the existing advisory and consultancy services throughout Scotland, 
            and recognises the vital strategic importance of the decision to the
