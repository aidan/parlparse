<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4141</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>A Strategy for Older Volunteering</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>The Hidden Resource: A Strategy for Older Volunteering in Scotland </em>by the Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme of Community Service Volunteers; notes that this initiative follows months of research into the benefits of volunteering by people aged 50 and over both to society as a whole and to the volunteers themselves and that it complements the Volunteering Strategy of the Scottish Executive; further notes the valuable contribution already made by older citizens in supporting local community organisations and individuals throughout Scotland, enriching the lives of people of all ages, and believes that Scotland&rsquo;s ageing population provides great opportunities as well as challenges.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4140</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Proposed Demutualisation of Standard Life</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned to note the proposed demutualisation of Standard Life, in light of the recent report of the Cross Party Group at Westminster which found, in line with previous research by the Building Societies Association, that demutualisation &quot;had a largely negative impact on customer choice and financial services provision in the UK&quot;, that mutuals had &quot;largely out-performed their plc rivals&quot; in value for savers or borrowers and that the best way of &quot;ensuring that inter-generational equity created over the last 180 years in this successful company is available in the years to come to benefit the greater community of Scotland&quot; is for Standard Life to retain its mutual status.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4139</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Scottish Marine Energy Industry on the ROCs?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the warning from the fledgling Scottish marine renewables industry that the Renewables Obligation Scotland, the market mechanism that could drive the expansion of&nbsp;the marine renewable energy industry, must be urgently amended if Scotland is to maintain its leading position in this field;&nbsp; congratulates Ocean Power Delivery (OPD) on the export of its Pelamis wave power device to Portugal in a deal worth &pound;50 million, but shares OPD&rsquo;s regret that its first commercial contract to generate electricity was not in Scotland; acknowledges the World Energy Council&rsquo;s estimate that the global wave energy market is worth &pound;500 billion and therefore finds it difficult to reconcile the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s failure to support adequately the marine renewables industry with the Executive&rsquo;s claim that its top priority is growing the Scottish economy, and calls on the Executive to recognise the dangers faced by the Scottish marine renewables industry and to take immediate steps to ensure that this golden opportunity is not lost to Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4138</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Borders Forest Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates The Borders Forest Trust which celebrates 10 years of restoring native woodlands this year; notes that since its establishment in 1996 it has planted over 800,000 native trees and shrubs and currently supports 29 community woodlands, reconnecting people with their local woods and utilising local hardwood timber resources and woodworking talent; further notes that these ideals were merged in 1996 to form the Trust and Woodschool, which itself received double honours in 2005 at the Dynamic Places Awards, winning the Sir Robert Grieve Award for sustainability and being highly commended in the Connected Places category; recognises that the Trust and Woodschool have had a substantial effect on the Borders&rsquo; economy and are fine examples of sustainable and sympathetic development, and therefore encourages people of the Borders and beyond to take part in the many events running throughout the year in celebration of this 10th anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4137</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Street Lighting - Safer Communities, Better Environment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of good street lighting in tackling crime and improving public safety; further notes the potential environmental benefits that could result from the replacement of old lighting equipment with new energy efficient bulbs, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with local authorities to develop a plan to provide Scotland with modern, efficient and effective street lighting.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4136</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Anniversary of Halabja Massacre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, along with Kurdish communities and other organisations around the world, remembers 16 March 2006 as the 18th anniversary of the attack on Halabja; respects the memories of the thousands who died and recognises the pain of those who survived but suffer long-term health effects; condemns any use of chemical weapons and attacks against civilian populations; reaffirms its opposition to genocide, and supports the call to bring to justice those responsible for the attack, to seek compensation for the victims of the attack, to work to address the environmental problems caused by this attack and others and to help the refugees of these attacks to return to their homelands.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4135</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>EU Prohibition of Battery Cages for Egg Laying Hens</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the EU-wide prohibition of conventional battery cages for egg-laying hens which is due to come into force in 2012 under EU Council Directive 1999/74 is to be reviewed during 2006; firmly believes that the prohibition should remain in place and should not be repealed or postponed; notes that the report of the Scientific Panel for Animal Health and Welfare of the European Food Safety Authority concludes that the inability of battery hens to engage in their natural behaviours poses a particularly severe threat to their welfare, and urges the Scottish Executive to press Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to take the lead in persuading our EU partners that the prohibition of conventional battery cages should neither be repealed nor postponed but should come into force in 2012 as enacted by Council Directive 1999/74.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4134</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Wild Animals in Circuses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned for the welfare of wild animals in circuses; commends the Born Free Foundation for its investigation into this issue and notes the findings of the scientifically based report by the Born Free Foundation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; recognises that, due to their dependency on regular travel, circuses cannot provide sizeable and complex living conditions for wild animals; further recognises that, under such circumstances, satisfactory standards of welfare cannot be provided, and therefore supports the introduction of measures to end the use of wild animals in circuses.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4133</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Unions Work: Rebuilding Scotland&rsquo;s Trade Union Movement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament joins with the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) in welcoming the rise in trade union membership levels in Scotland; acknowledges that statistics show that 2005 saw a rise of over 4,000 in the membership of STUC-affiliated trade unions, giving a membership density of some 33.7 per cent; believes that the increase in the number of women members is particular proof that Scotland&rsquo;s unions are organising better, campaigning better and recruiting better around the issues that concern Scottish workers; believes that membership of a trade union remains the best way for individual workers to achieve better workplaces and a better Scotland; congratulates the STUC and its affiliates on the success of the &quot;Unions Work&quot; campaign, and declares that modern, growing trade unions are an important, indeed vital, part of both Scottish society and of the viability and future success of Scotland&rsquo;s economy.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4123</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Excessive Paperwork</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that many aspects of Scottish life suffer from an excess of regulation and paperwork, which is created and imposed by the European Union, Whitehall, the Scottish Executive, councils and health and other authorities, and suggests that, to help reduce this burden and to free the energies and initiative of those burdened, relevant Parliamentary committees should each set up a reduction of bureaucracy sub-group which would work with the initiators of, and sufferers from, excessive regulation and paperwork with the aim of significantly reducing its volume.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4122</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Artists&rsquo; Rates of Pay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that public bodies, such as the Scottish Executive, councils and health, enterprise and education authorities, should pay agreed professional rates to artists working in any of the arts in projects funded by public bodies.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4121</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Support the Strike for Pension Rights on 28 March 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the overwhelming mandate from local government workers to strike in defence of their contractual pension rights on 28 March 2006; regrets that the actions of the Westminster Government and the Scottish Executive in pressing for the abolition of the Rule of 85 have directly caused this trade union revolt; believes that there is no justification for this erosion of the pension rights of local government workers, most of whom are low-paid and women who already suffer pay discrimination; wholeheartedly supports the trade unions in their campaign, and calls on the Executive to stick up for workers in their jurisdiction by declaring their support for the retention of the Rule of 85 and, by so doing, to exert pressure on the Westminster Government to draw back from the biggest confrontation with workers since 1926.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4119</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Lothian Buses Fares Increases</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep disappointment at the decision by Lothian Buses to increase its fares by up to 25%; believes that the increases will act as a further disincentive to people to use public transport in the region at a time when the city faces significant congestion problems and car exhaust emissions; notes that the company blames the rise on the fuel prices over the past year, yet in recent months these costs have in fact been falling; calls on Lothian Buses to reconsider its decision and recognise that the costs of short bus journeys in the city of Edinburgh are now among the most expensive in Scotland, and believes that Lothian Buses&rsquo; decision is both economically short-sighted and detrimental to strategies for encouraging greater public transport and countering environmental pollution.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4117</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Mehmet Tarhan is Free</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends solidarity greetings to Mehmet Tarhan, the gay Kurdish conscientious objector who was released from military prison in Turkey on 9 March 2006; notes that the &quot;crime&quot; for which he has been imprisoned since 9 April 2005 was refusing to kill, as he is a conscientious objector and refused to be drafted into the Turkish army; is appalled that he suffered torture and solitary confinement while in prison and twice went on hunger strike to win equal treatment with other prisoners; considers that his release is a victory for his determination to refuse the army&rsquo;s offer of avoiding the draft by allowing himself to be classified as &quot;ill&quot; because he is gay; considers it abhorrent that the Turkish army and police, and even teachers, are allowed to perform &quot;virginity tests&quot;, involving forced anal and vaginal penetration of men and women, which are a pretext to perpetrate rape and other sexual violence and notes that Mehmet Tarhan refused to submit to this abuse; further notes that the court which freed Mehmet has ruled that such &quot;tests&quot; are a violation of human rights and considers that this precedent will help in women&rsquo;s struggle against this form of legalised abuse in Turkey; is concerned that, despite his release from prison, the army could still try to force Mehmet to serve against his will; congratulates the Payday and Wages Due Lesbians organisations for their work in highlighting Mehmet&rsquo;s case, campaigning for his release and for exposing the persecution of conscientious objectors in Turkey, and demands that Turkey be forced to adhere to the European Court of Human Rights&rsquo; guidance and other international rulings recognising the right to conscientious objection and to abolish from its military regulations the definition of homosexuality as an illness.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4114</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Global CO2 Concentrations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has now reached 381 parts per million, the highest level for at least one million years; further notes that concentrations have risen by 2.6 parts per million over the past year, one of the largest annual increases on record; believes that urgent action is vital if we have any chance to stabilise atmospheric carbon levels; notes the confirmed closure of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology unit at Banchory which will weaken Scottish-based research into climate change and its effects, and calls on the Scottish Executive to consider legislative moves similar to those in Westminster where Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative politicians have joined forces to propose legislation on micro-renewable power and the setting of annual reduction targets for CO2 emissions.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4113</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Closure of Centre for Ecology and Hydrology</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to close the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology at Banchory, along with three other centres in England; recognises the groundbreaking research into climate change for which the centre had a deservedly high reputation; considers the closures to be tantamount to environmental vandalism, and urges the Scottish Executive to fight tooth and nail to resist these closures and to lobby the UK Government and the NERC to rethink this decision.</p>
