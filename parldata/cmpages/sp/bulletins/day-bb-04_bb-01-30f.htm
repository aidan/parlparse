          <p><strong>*S2M-840</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>20 
            mph Speed Zones Around Schools in Dundee</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates Dundee City Council on its decision to introduce 20 
            mph speed limits in the area of all of its primary and secondary schools; 
            regards this decision as an important step in improving road safety 
            amongst both school children and road users in and around schools, 
            and further regards it as a step towards the successful accomplishment 
            of the Scottish Executive's target of reducing by half the number 
            of children killed or seriously injured in road accidents by the year 
            2010.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-839#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Safety 
            Belts on School Buses</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the 
            Scottish Executive should ensure greater standards of safety in school 
            transport by drawing up a phased timetable, with appropriate targets, 
            so that all buses contracted by local education authorities to carry 
            children between school and home and on school trips will be fitted 
            with seatbelts.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, 
            Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-838</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Asylum 
            and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That 
            the Parliament endorses the principle of creating a new offence to 
            combat trafficking in human beings for non-sexual exploitation as 
            set out in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) 
            Bill and agrees that the provisions to achieve this end in Scotland 
            which relate to devolved matters should be considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p></P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-837</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Solidarity 
            with Diane Wilson</strong>-That the Parliament notes with alarm the 
            charges of criminal trespass and resisting arrest brought against 
            leading US environmental activist Diane Wilson; acknowledges that 
            these charges are an attempt to silence a woman whose only crime has 
            been to act peacefully in the interests of the people of Texas; recognises 
            that the actions committed were only an attempt to draw attention 
            to Union Carbide/Dow's moral responsibility to face up to the ongoing 
            horrors in Bhopal, India, the scene of the world's worst industrial 
            disaster, and calls upon the Texan authorities to recognise that Diane 
            was motivated by nothing more than the necessity of alerting the people 
            of Texas to the dangers posed by the pesticide industry and to drop 
            all criminal charges against her.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-836#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Inadequate 
            Consultation by Royal Mail on Closure of Local Post Offices</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that the consultation period for Royal Mail's 
            proposed closures of post offices started on 2<SUP> </SUP>December 
            2003 and ended only six weeks later, spanning the Christmas and New 
            Year holiday period, thereby pressurising post office users and elected 
            representatives to respond to a critically important consultation 
            at a time when they were focused on celebrations and preparations 
            for the holiday period; further notes that Royal Mail based its decisions 
            on incomplete information and a classification of settlements as rural 
            or urban that was 15 years out of date and proposed closures of post 
            offices that do comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 
            while keeping open post offices that do not comply with the Act; notes 
            that decisions to close post offices in some instances appear to have 
            been made with little regard to submissions from local representatives 
            or the views of post office users and that in some cases the decisions 
            have been made prior to consultation meetings with the public having 
            taken place, and is concerned at Royal Mail's style of consultation 
            that goes to the heart of how this decision-maker has treated with 
            contempt individuals in communities across Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-835#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Hepatitis 
            C Ex Gratia Payment Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            the ex gratia payment scheme for people infected with hepatitis C 
            from NHS blood or blood products will now be administered through 
            a UK-wide scheme; regrets that there has been a delay of over a year 
            in establishing this scheme due to protracted negotiations between 
            the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government; believes that 
            the scheme is flawed as it does not include payments to the relatives 
            of those who have died from hepatitis C, and further believes that 
            the Executive should reconsider the level of payments and the exclusion 
            of family members from the ex gratia payment scheme.</P>

            the Finance Committee recommends that the draft Budget (Scotland) 
            Act 2003 Amendment Order 2004 be approved.</P>

            by a subsidiary of Thames Water plc, and *considers that* the Scottish
