         <p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
         <p>9.30 am&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
         <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Green Party Debate: Energy Efficiency&mdash; </p>
         <p><strong>S2M-2462</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Towards an Energy Efficiency Strategy in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that energy efficiency has great potential to improve efforts to tackle climate change and fuel poverty and to improve quality of life; agrees that energy efficiency has a key part to play in meeting the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s target of eradicating fuel poverty in Scotland by 2016; further agrees that more than half the emissions reductions in the United Kingdom&rsquo;s climate change programme could come from energy efficiency, as stated in the UK Energy White Paper, and commends the Executive for its current initiatives to improve energy efficiency and for its move towards a national strategic approach to energy efficiency as outlined in its climate change consultation. </p>
         <blockquote>
           <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
           <p><strong>S2M-2462.1</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Towards an Energy Efficiency Strategy in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2462) in the name of Shiona Baird, after &quot;improve quality of life&quot; insert &quot;and increase competitiveness of businesses in Scotland&quot; </p>
           <p> <strong>S2M-2462.3</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Towards an Energy Efficiency Strategy in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2462) in the name of Shiona Baird, leave out from &quot;and commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;while supporting any moves to increase energy efficiency notes that this must be in tandem with eradicating fuel poverty which affects 13% of households involving some 30,000 children; notes that, for every 5% increase in fuel prices, 30,000 are returned to fuel poverty and that one in five pensioners struggle to keep warm, all of which is often compounded by damp and poor housing conditions which is to be deplored in an energy and resources-rich nation; notes that endeavours to amend the Housing (Scotland) Bill in 2001 to raise tolerable standards, including measures to facilitate energy efficiency, were resisted by the Executive on the argument that its fuel poverty strategy would resolve these problems which it singularly is failing to do; calls on the Executive to raise mandatory housing standards as a matter of urgency, and affirms that only an integrated approach to energy efficiency and fuel poverty can both impact on climate change and improve quality of life.&quot; </p>
           <p> <strong>S2M-2462.2</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Towards an Energy Efficiency Strategy in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2462) in the name of Shiona Baird, leave out from &quot;has a key part&quot; to end and insert &quot;is widely recognised as the cheapest, cleanest and safest way of achieving Britain&rsquo;s climate change commitments; notes that while climate change is a global challenge, energy efficiency gives ordinary people an opportunity to act locally and make a contribution, but believes, however, that the Scottish Executive could do more to promote energy efficiency in Scotland.&quot; </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Green Party Debate: ID Cards&mdash; </p>
         <p><strong>S2M-2463</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Identity Cards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Identity Cards Bill currently being considered by the Westminster Parliament; is concerned at the lack of time devoted to the scrutiny of this Bill, which has left important questions unanswered over how the identity card scheme will work in practice; believes the proposals to be flawed on political, technical and financial grounds; is concerned that the national identity card and database offer an ineffective response to problems of security and fraud and pose an unacceptable threat to civil liberties; notes that the current cost estimate for the scheme is &pound;5.5 billion and that further escalation of this cost is expected; rejects the Prime Minister&rsquo;s belief, stated on 1 December 2004 in the House of Commons, that &quot;it is legitimate and right, in this day and age, to ask people to carry identity cards&quot; which appears to go far beyond the current scope of the Bill and would require the consent of the Scottish Parliament; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s position that identity cards will not be required to allow access to devolved public services, and calls on the Executive to make a full statement on the intended use of the identity database by devolved institutions. </p>
         <blockquote>
           <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
           <p><strong>S2M-2463.4</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: Identity Cards</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2463) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the current position of the Scottish Executive in relation to devolved services; believes that identity cards are a central tool in the fight against organised crime and international terrorism; further notes that ID cards would provide a gold standard of identity in the modern world, and recognises that ID cards have attracted overwhelming public support as they assist significantly in delivering safer, more secure communities.&quot; </p>
           <p> <strong>S2M-2463.1</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Identity Cards</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2463) in the name of Patrick Harvie, insert at end &quot;and expresses concern that the data format and operation likely to be associated with proposed identity cards conforms to no formal international standard and carries the real risk of data disclosure to commercial interests.&quot; </p>
           <p> <strong>S2M-2463.3</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Identity Cards</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2463) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets the introduction of the Identity Cards Bill to the UK Parliament, notes the consistent opposition to these proposals by Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons on the grounds that they will be ineffective in their stated aim of reducing terrorism; believes that there is an excessive cost to the individual and the taxpayer in introducing the identity card; believes that it will lead to increased discrimination and harassment; is concerned for the protection of civil liberties with the lack of definition of how the card will be used; further believes that the UK Government should explore more effective anti identity and benefits fraud, illegal immigration and illegal working measures; is further concerned with the UK Government&rsquo;s intention that by 2013 it will be compulsory for UK citizens to possess an ID card and to produce it when accessing designated public services, and welcomes the commitment by the Scottish Executive that identity cards will not be necessary for accessing devolved services.&quot; </p>
