            <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Lord Advocate's Reference in Trident Case</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the decision of Sheriff Gimblett in October 1999 
            in the case of the &quot;Trident Women&quot;, who were acquitted of 
            causing malicious damage relating to the Trident Missile Programme 
            on the basis that the women's actions could be regarded as crime prevention 
            through the disarmament of illegal and criminal weapons of mass destruction; 
            further notes that a Lord Advocate's Reference is being heard on related 
            issues; expresses deep concern that in a case of such substantial 
            public interest, proceedings will not be officially recorded; regrets 
            that, as a consequence, there will be no official transcript available 
            to the public or to the respondents; recognises that this may infringe 
            European human rights law; notes further that the respondents will 
            not be allowed audio recording to assist their own record-keeping 
            in the light of the absence of an official record; questions the use 
            of £100,000 of public money for the Lord Advocate's Reference hearing, 
            and calls for the official recording of the proceedings to take place.</font></p>

            <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Central Aberdeenshire Youth Advice Project</strong>-That 
            the Parliament deplores the fact that Aberdeenshire Council has forced 
            the closure of the Central Aberdeenshire Youth Advice Project by refusing 
            a grant of £26,000 on 30 August 2000; recognises that the decision 
            by the council will deny young people aged between 13 and 24, who 
            have used this service for the last four years, the provision of confidential 
            advice, information and support from qualified staff and fully trained 
            volunteers on matters relating to drugs, teenage pregnancies, abortions, 
            sexually transmitted diseases and other issues concerning young people, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive to ask Aberdeenshire Council

            working for the establishment of genuine democracy, with freedom of 
            speech and fair elections free of corruption; supports those parties 
            in their ongoing struggle, and deplores any measure that denies the 
            electorate the right to vote for the party or individual of their

            <strong>John Scott: SSI, SPA and SAC Designations</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes and expresses its concern at the significant increase in proposed 
            designations of Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Special Protection 
            Areas and Special Areas of Conservation made during the last year 
            and covering more than 8% of Scotland's landmass; asks the Scottish 
            Executive to report to Parliament on the scientific basis for these 
            designations; further asks the Executive to report on the findings 
            of any consultations undertaken prior to designation, and believes 
            that this issue should be debated in Parliament before these designations 
            are finalised.</font></p>

            <strong>Shona Robison: Community Care Services for Elderly People</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes with concern the loss of 
            30,000 home care hours since 1998 due to cutbacks in local government 
            funding, making it more difficult for many elderly people to remain 
            living at home; is further concerned about the 10,000 people awaiting 
            an occupational therapy assessment for basic aids and adaptations; 
            recognises the current postcode lottery which elderly people face 
            when trying to access community care services, and calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to implement fully the recommendations of the report 
            by the Royal Commission into Long Term Care in order to address the 
            concerns about community care expressed by carers, voluntary organisations 
            and elderly people themselves.</a></font></p>

            together with the McIntosh and Kerley recommendations, should be debated 
            as a whole, and, in view of the limited timescale, resolves that the 
            next local authority elections should take place on the basis of the 
            existing first-past-the-post electoral system which delivers accountability, 
            a clear link between elected member and voter and puts the power to 
            create administrations in the hands of voters rather than politicians.

            and further recognises that the Liberal Democrats have opposed all 
            fuel duty increases since the introduction of the fuel escalator under 
            the last Conservative government and support (a) a cap on fuel taxes 
            in real terms for five years, (b) investment of additional resources
