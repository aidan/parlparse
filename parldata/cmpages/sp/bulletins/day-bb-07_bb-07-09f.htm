<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm" target="_self"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-286&diams; </strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Christian Aid Cut the Carbon March</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Christian Aid on its Cut the Carbon march, beginning on 14 July 2007 in Belfast and ending on 2 October 2007 in London, which aims to highlight the impact of global warming on poorer communities across the world and, in particular, the threat of increased drought, disease and food shortages as a result of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-285</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Scottish Spina Bifida Association Centre, Cumbernauld</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the vital work carried out by the Scottish Spina Bifida Association by providing the only specialist family support service for spina bifida and hydrocephalus in Scotland; welcomes the new family support centre in Cumbernauld which has allowed the association to expand its support services to best meet users&rsquo; needs by providing a relaxing environment for families to visit and training, recreation and support services; congratulates the association on the creation of a specialist telemedicine suite which is the first to be located outwith a hospital setting and which enables those with spina bifida and hydrocephalus to receive medical advice from health professionals based across the United Kingdom; recognises that Scotland has more live births with spina bifida per head of population than anywhere else in the UK, resulting in one pregnancy per week in Scotland being affected by spina bifida and/or hydrocephalus, and notes that taking folic acid supplements at the correct recommended dose could prevent over 75% of those pregnancies from being affected.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-284</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Wilson Doctrine</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Wilson Doctrine, developed in the late 1960s, banned the tapping of MPs&rsquo; and peers&rsquo; telephones; further notes that in 2006, following representations to have the doctrine revoked, the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, rejected revocation after a backbench rebellion and that this remains the position to this day; notes with concern that the Wilson Doctrine does not apply to MSPs, and considers that duly elected members of the Scottish Parliament should be offered the same protection from intrusion as applies to duly elected members of the Westminster government in the interests of performing their public duty free from covert surveillance and in the interests of democracy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-283</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Thomas Telford Celebrations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 9 August 2007 marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of Thomas Telford, known as &quot;<em>pontifex maximus</em>&quot;, the high priest of bridges; further notes that in the Highlands alone Thomas Telford was responsible for the building of over 1,200 miles of roads, many harbours and churches and over 1,000 bridges, one of which was the Craigellachie bridge in Moray which spans the River Spey; notes that, when completed in 1815, this 150ft bridge was regarded as one of the finest cast iron bridges in Britain as it still is; supports Moray Council in the celebrations it has organised to celebrate the life and works of an engineer whose structures are still much admired almost two centuries after their completion, and further supports the Institution of Civil Engineers for awarding the bridge International Landmark status, becoming one of only 200 buildings in the world to be awarded this prestigious status and joining the ranks of the Eiffel Tower and San Francisco&rsquo;s Golden Gate Bridge.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-276</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Welcome Freedom, Lasting Peace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses great relief and delight at the release of the BBC&rsquo;s correspondent, Alan Johnston, who had been kidnapped and held captive for over three months in Gaza City, Palestine; notes the comments of Mr Johnston, who said that Hamas&rsquo;s seizure of power in Gaza and its subsequent pledge to improve security in the territory had facilitated his release; welcomes the important role that the Hamas government played in securing his release, and believes that this act and the subsequent acknowledgment of Hamas&rsquo;s crucial role by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, should serve as a springboard to facilitate discussion with the Hamas government over the crucial issues which need to be addressed in order to achieve lasting peace in the region.</p>
