            in Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26193</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask

            a salmon fishing under Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26194</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask

            salmon fishings unaffected by the exercise of the provisions to acquire 
            salmon fishings compulsorily in Part 3 of the Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26195</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what measures it plans to prevent owners of 
            salmon fishings from avoiding compulsory purchase of their salmon 
            fishings under Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill by the creation 
            of tenancies, time shares or syndication arrangements.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26196</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive why communities should be given the opportunity 
            by Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill to purchase land compulsorily 
            in order to utilise it in a holistic fashion if this were to cause 
            land severance and deny the present owner the ability to manage his 
            land in a holistic fashion.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26197</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive why communities should be given the opportunity 
            under Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill to purchase part of 
            a salmon fishing compulsorily so that it may be utilised in a holistic 
            fashion with croft land if this were to cause severance of the ownership 
            and management of the salmon fishing and deny the present owners the 
            ability to manage the salmon fishing in a holistic fashion.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26198</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive why the Minister for Justice considered that 
            the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill was within the legislative competence 
            of the Parliament, and therefore compatible with ECHR, given that 
            Part 3 of the Bill includes provisions to expropriate compulsorily 
            salmon fishings. </p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26199</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive why it considers it necessary to include salmon 
            fishings within the provisions of compulsory purchase in Part 3 of 
            the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill when it believes that the provisions 
            will rarely be exercised in relation to salmon fishings.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26200</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether the expression &quot;inland waters&quot; 
            is to have the same meaning in Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) 
            Bill as it does in Part 1 of the Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26201</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how many responses to its consultation paper, 
            <em>Draft</em> <em>Land Reform (Scotland) Bill</em> expressed (a) support 
            for, and (b) opposition to, the provisions in Part 3 of the Land Reform 
            (Scotland) Bill for the compulsory purchase of salmon fishings, and 
            which bodies expressed such support or opposition.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26203</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how much of the £1.5 million Strategic Change 
            Fund for museums has been allocated to assist Glasgow museums.</p>
          <p><strong>S1W-26204</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> To ask
