<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong><br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;<br />
</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong><br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">current motions</a> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Any questions in relation to this section should be directed to the Chamber Desk, for which contact details are provided at the end of the Bulletin.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00032 Mary Scanlon: Congratulations to Nairn County FC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Nairn County FC on its 4-0 victory over Fraserburgh FC in the Fosters Highland League Cup final; notes that the final match pitted the Highland Football League&rsquo;s two longest serving managers against each other, with Les Fridge and his Nairn County side emerging as victors; praises the management, players and supporters of Nairn County FC for achieving this result, and congratulates all the teams and match officials involved with the Highland Football League who have once again provided a memorable season for supporters of all clubs.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00031 Marco Biagi: Play Fair with Donaldson&rsquo;s</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the submission by Cala Homes to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland to remove restrictions on developments in front of the former Donaldson&rsquo;s School; considers that, regardless of planning controls, there would be no need to remove these restrictions if there were no desire to develop the site, and believes that the site&rsquo;s historic and scenic beauty should be preserved.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00030 Jackie Baillie: Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply disappointed with figures from the Scottish Government indicating that progress on tackling poverty in Scotland has stalled; notes that more than 200,000 children are still living in poverty across the country; further notes that, in 2009-10, the proportion of working age adults in relative poverty increased; considers that cuts being made to public services across Scotland will have a significant impact on people already struggling on low incomes; supports the 100 Day Challenge proposed by the Poverty Alliance that calls on the Scottish Government to make tackling poverty a priority by putting concern for poverty and inequality at the heart of government and for it to tackle low pay and in-work poverty, to promote fairer welfare, to address socioeconomic inequality, to change perceptions of people living in poverty and involve people with direct experience of poverty in the development of policy, and calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent and sustained action to address what it considers to be the increasing problem of poverty in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00029 Jamie Hepburn: Cumbernauld and Kilsyth&rsquo;s Rugby Stars </strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its congratulations to St Joseph&rsquo;s, Chapelgreen, St Patrick&rsquo;s, Ravenswood, and Carbrain and Cumbernauld primaries on successfully qualifying for the North Lanarkshire area primary six and seven rugby finals, which are to take place in Coatbridge on 3 June 2011; applauds the hard work of all those who have taken part in the tournament so far, and wishes the best of luck to those competing in the finals.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00028 Jim Eadie: Child Poverty and The Hunter Foundation Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the launch of the charitable initiative by The Hunter Foundation (THF) in association with Scottish Television that will partner with the following leading charities in Scotland, Aberlour, Action for Children, Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland, CHILDREN 1st, Save the Children Scotland and One Parent Families Scotland; welcomes the venture&rsquo;s focus in its first year on children affected by poverty; notes that 200,000, one in four children in Scotland, still live in relative poverty despite a 10,000 drop on the previous year; further notes that the venture will seek to create long-term sustainable change in the lives of Scotland&rsquo;s most at-risk children and young people; applauds the focus of the campaign on raising awareness, challenging stereotypes and bringing attention to the real extent of child poverty, aiming to tackle both the causes and effects of poverty and disadvantage; recognises the fact that all operational costs of the charitable venture will be covered by THF, meaning that every penny donated by the public will go directly to support those children most in need, and looks forward to the success of this innovative and collaborative approach involving the public, private and third sectors in being able to provide a strong and lasting partnership that can make a difference to the lives of Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable children and young people.</p>
