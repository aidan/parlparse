            <P><strong>S2M-541</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Scotland's 
              Transport</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance 
              of the Scottish Executive's proposals for improving transport in 
              Scotland as set out in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em>, 
              in particular its intention to set up a transport agency to secure 
              delivery of the Executive's major investment programme to expand 
              transport infrastructure and services across Scotland and to improve 
              the integration of these services, the proposals to enhance the 
              schemes of concessionary fares to benefit elderly and disabled people 
              and the proposals to enhance the ability of local government to 
              serve the travelling public through stronger regional transport 
              partnerships, which should contribute to an effective transport 
              system, central to a thriving economy and strong communities. </P>
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p><strong>S2M-541.4</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Scotland's 
              Transport</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-541) in the name 
              of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;and the proposals&quot; to 
              end and insert &quot;; notes with concern the under-performance 
              of the Executive on major transport schemes to date; notes that 
              for the new agency to be successful there must be transparency, 
              accountability and direction for Scotland on all aspects of transport 
              policy whether road, rail, marine or air, and recognises that the 
              new agency should be strategic and should not undermine the role 
              and function of Strathclyde Passenger Transport nor any future statutory 
              regional transport authority elsewhere in Scotland and that the 
              performance of the agency should be monitored to ensure that it 
              delivers improvements to allow Scotland's transport system to match 
              those of its European competitors.&quot; </p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-541.1</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Scotland's Transport</strong>-As 
              an amendment to motion (S2M-541) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave 
              out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets 
              that the Scottish Executive's transport policies continue to be 
              driven by spin, the need for press releases and photo opportunities 
              and a determination to introduce road tolls; notes the Scottish 
              Executive's continuing failure to make any firm financial commitments 
              to significant infrastructure projects, such as the Borders rail 
              link and addressing missing strategic links in the road network; 
              believes that there is no evidence that the introduction of further 
              bureaucracy and delays to decision-making, as represented by the 
              proposed transport agency, will improve infrastructure or services, 
              and calls upon the Executive to produce detailed and costed measures 
              with start and completion dates for the major transport infrastructure 
              programmes that the Scottish economy and local communities need 
              in the 21st century.&quot; </p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-541.2</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance: Scotland's 
              Transport</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-541) in the name 
              of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and 
              insert &quot;notes with concern the Scottish Executive's proposals 
              for improving transport in Scotland, as set out in <em>A Partnership 
              for a Better Scotland</em>, in particular its failure to give sufficient 
              support for healthy transport initiatives such as walking and cycling; 
              further notes that the finance put aside so far overwhelmingly relates 
              to encouraging road and air transport, the most polluting forms 
              to transport, and, while welcoming any extension of concessionary 
              fares, regrets the failure to promote an effective public transport 
              system in Scotland.&quot; </p>
