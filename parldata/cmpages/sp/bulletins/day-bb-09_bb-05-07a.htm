<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: School Discipline&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4067</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>School Discipline</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the rise in the number of exclusions from Scottish schools attributable to weapon attacks by pupils; notes the growing concern expressed by teachers and parents that serious and persistent offenders are not being punished appropriately; calls on the Scottish Government to publish detailed information at regular intervals on the level of reported physical and verbal attacks in schools, as called for by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning when in opposition, and believes that the Scottish Government should devolve more power to head teachers to deal with indiscipline in schools. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4067.3</strong> <strong>Keith Brown: School Discipline</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4067) in the name of Elizabeth Smith, leave out from &quot;as called&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the 11% reduction in exclusions from Scottish schools from 2006-07 to 2007-08; acknowledges that appropriate support should be provided to the small number of children and young people who persistently misbehave; further acknowledges that head teachers already have considerable power over school discipline through their responsibility for school discipline policies and their devolved responsibility for excluding pupils; agrees that the future policy on behaviour in schools should be informed by the survey currently being conducted by the University of Edinburgh on behalf of the Scottish Government, which will provide in-depth information on this area, and further welcomes the comments in the HM Inspectorate of Education report, Improving Scottish Education 2005-2008, in relation to secondary schools, which states &quot;In almost all schools, climate and relationships are constructive and encouraging. While many schools have small numbers of young people with particularly challenging behaviour, any issues arising are usually handled effectively. Most schools have clear and concerted strategies for promoting positive behaviour&quot;.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4067.1</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh: School Discipline</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4067) in the name of Elizabeth Smith, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports all appropriate measures to uphold the rights of teachers to teach and pupils to learn in a disciplined environment; notes the significant steps made by the previous administration to achieve this including the setting up of the Discipline Task Group, the removal of restrictions on head teachers to exclude pupils if necessary, the use of special units, support for teacher training, reduced class sizes and more classroom assistants, and calls on the Scottish Government to address the recent decline in teacher numbers and support staff, including behaviour support staff, and to work in partnership with key stakeholders to put in place a framework for a discipline code in every school incorporating rights and responsibilities for head teachers, teachers, parents and pupils.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-4067.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: School Discipline</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4067) in the name of Elizabeth Smith, insert at end &quot;and further believes that the Scottish Government should engage closely with pupils, staff, the voluntary sector and other partner organisations to improve formal and non-formal learning opportunities for young people to ensure that they are not excluded from education.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Community Courts&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4065</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Community Courts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the decision of the Scottish Government not to proceed with the establishment of a community court in Glasgow; recognises that community courts based on the New York City model in Midtown can address patterns of offending behaviour by providing for swift and effective summary justice coupled with a range of rehabilitation services to break the cycle of reoffending, and believes that the recent action taken by the Scottish Government demonstrates its incoherent approach towards addressing crime and the causes of crime and to providing viable and robust alternatives to custody. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4065.3</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Community Courts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4065) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that community courts based on the New York City model in Midtown can help to address patterns of offending behaviour by providing for swift and effective summary justice coupled with a range of rehabilitation services to break the cycle of reoffending; notes the decision by the project board for the Glasgow Community Justice Centre that in the current economic circumstances they should not proceed with the development of a new court building, and supports the joint work underway between Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government to identify how best offenders can pay back for their crimes to the communities most in need of reinvestment and local services can be directed to support offenders out of a life of crime.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4065.1</strong> <strong>Richard Baker: Community Courts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4065) in the name of Bill Aitken, insert at end &quot;and further believes that the Scottish Government should reverse its decision and seek to progress plans for a community court in Glasgow.&quot; </p>
