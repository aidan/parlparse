            <strong>Richard Lochhead: Meetings of the Parliament in North East Scotland</strong>—That 

            the Parliament believes that, since Edinburgh and Glasgow have already 

            played host to the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Parliamentary 

            Corporate Body and the Parliamentary Bureau should identify a suitable 

            location in the north east of Scotland for the period in 2002 when 

            a temporary home will once more have to be sought in order to allow 

            the Church of Scotland General Assembly to return to the Mound.</font></p>

            <strong>Christine Grahame: The Disability Claim Form</strong>—That the Parliament 

            notes that the 5th issue of <i>Inform</i>, Citizens Advice Scotland’s 

            Quarterly Social Policy Briefing, identifies social security benefits 

            as the biggest category of problems dealt with by bureaux, with 133,272 

            enquiries; further notes that, of these, disability benefits amounted 

            to 20,244 enquiries, income support 16,524 and housing benefit 12,274; 

            recognises that disability benefits are a particular concern because 

            of the complexity of the form and because decisions are sometimes 

            contradictory, leading to some entitlement being removed altogether; 

            notes that applicants may be charged up to £40 by their GP for a medical 

            assessment; notes that the complexity of the application system is 

            evidenced by the 10,510 repeat enquiries which bureaux dealt with 

            in this area; commends the citizens advice service on representing 

            638 clients at disability appeals tribunals, two thirds of which had 

            positive outcomes, and urges the Scottish Executive, against this 

            background, to make representations to Her Majesty’s Government requesting 

            that the application system be reformed without delay.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: PETA's Irresponsible Campaign Against Milk and 

            Dairy Products</strong>—That the Parliament condemns as totally irresponsible 

            and ill-informed the campaign by People for the Ethical Treatment 

            of Animals (PETA) against milk and dairy products; is aware that Scottish 

            dairy farmers produce milk to among the highest standards in the world; 

            is disgusted that PETA should play on the fears and insecurities of 

            children in pursuit of their goals; notes that the claims made by 

            PETA against milk and dairy products are totally without foundation; 

            is aware that a diet which includes milk and dairy products is greatly 

            beneficial to young people as a source of calcium, energy and protein, 

            and believes that this issue provides the Scottish Executive with 

            an excellent opportunity to highlight the advantages to school age 

            children of consuming milk and dairy products, particularly in areas 

            of social exclusion.</font></p>
