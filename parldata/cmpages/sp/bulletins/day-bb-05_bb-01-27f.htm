          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2328 Christine May:Fife Constabulary - Use of Antisocial Behaviour Powers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of Fife Constabulary in obtaining a closure order on a flat in Leven under the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004; notes that the new powers introduced under this legislation made it possible for such an order to be granted; congratulates Fife Constabulary and Fife Council for this innovative use of the new powers; agrees with Mr Richard Martin of Leven who noted that it was regrettable that an Act of the Scottish Parliament was needed to deal with the antisocial behaviour to which he and his neighbours had been subjected for a lengthy period of time but nevertheless welcomes this addition to the legal framework in Scotland; regrets the opposition which was shown to the Bill in its passage through the Parliament by those who argued that such powers would not be needed and would prove ineffective; congratulates ministers and the Parliament for their courage in passing the legislation, and urges all involved in dealing with antisocial behaviour to study the actions of Fife Constabulary to see if similar solutions can be used across Scotland. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2327 Carolyn Leckie:Avoid Compromising the Smoking Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports a ban on smoking in public places; believes that this would be a positive pro-health measure, albeit limited, in the context of poverty-related ill-health; is concerned, however, that the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Bill, as introduced by the Scottish Executive, undermines the chance of a ban being introduced by including other controversial measures within the Bill such as further marketisation of health care and intellectual property and the plans for expansion of the authority to deem adults incapable of making informed decisions about their health needs or care; considers that these measures should not be introduced under the cover of such a high profile debate as the smoking ban and that they should have individual scrutiny as measures in themselves, and believes that, unless the Executive removes these sections from the Bill, the very laudable public health measure that is the smoking ban would be seriously compromised and risk defeat. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2326# Frances Curran:Use of Rubber Bullets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned and alarmed about recent press reports that the Scottish Police Force is training to use rubber bullets in anticipation of the G8 summit at Gleneagles in July; believes that rubber bullets should not be used on the streets of Perthshire, and considers that the Scottish Executive should clarify whether there is an intended use of rubber bullets. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2325 Dr Jean Turner:Congratulations to Kirkintilloch Skatepark Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the initiative of everyone involved in the Kirkintilloch Skatepark project which will help to keep children off the streets and will benefit them by giving valuable exercise and improving physical fitness; congratulates East Dunbartonshire Council and everyone working hard on the fundraising efforts for this skatepark initiative; commends the commitment of the chartered surveyors and planning advisers who are helping with funding and planning applications, and recognises the great effort by the future users of the skatepark who are also making a video to support their fundraising. </p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2324 Pauline McNeill:Kenny Richey Reprieve</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kenny Richey on having his murder conviction and sentence overturned after 18 years on death row in the United States; notes that the ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that Richey must be retried within 90 days or freed came only two days before the 18th anniversary of his incarceration at Mansfield Correctional Institution following his conviction for arson and murder in 1986 and his sentence to death on 27 January 1987; further notes that, although his case has been overturned on a technicality, Kenny Richey has always maintained his innocence and has been prepared to be executed rather than make a false confession; acknowledges the campaigning efforts, spearheaded by Amnesty International, in raising the public profile of this injustice, claiming it was one of the most compelling cases of apparent innocence that human rights campaigners have ever come across; welcomes the support of the British government and cross-party support of many MSPs in signing an <em>amicus curiae</em> and petitions; further welcomes the support that the campaign has received from the European Parliament, Pope John Paul II and the former Archbishop of Canterbury, and considers that MSPs and campaigners should keep up the pressure to support the campaign as the State of Ohio may continue with appeal proceedings against this decision within 14 days or set a date for a retrial within 90 days. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2323 Mike Rumbles:JDWetherspoon Pubs to be Smoke-Free</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by JD Wetherspoon to ban smoking in all of its pubs; notes the comments of Chairman, Tim Martin, firstly that a &ldquo;significant number of people are staying away from pubs and restaurants because they are too smoky&rdquo; and secondly that the UK Government&rsquo;s approach does not make sense since pubs can get around it by giving up food sales; welcomes the fact that smoking will be banned in its Aberdeen and Glasgow pubs from May 2005; commends this decision taken on straightforward business grounds, and welcomes the intention of the Scottish Executive to introduce a ban on smoking in enclosed public places from March 2006.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2320.1 Frances Curran:Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2320) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &ldquo;and to higher&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;; calls on the Executive to state categorically that no new nuclear power stations will be built in Scotland, bring forward the closure dates of all existing nuclear power stations in Scotland, initiate an immediate programme of investment in all aspects of renewable energy and create a publicly-owned, publicly-resourced renewable energy industry.&rdquo; </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2320.2 Richard Lochhead:Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2320) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &ldquo;is concerned&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;believes that Scotland is well placed to be Europe&rsquo;s energy powerhouse given our massive energy resources; believes that onshore and offshore wind energy is an important element in a balanced renewables policy but that the development of other renewables must be accelerated; shares the frustration expressed by many others, including Highland Council and the Parliament&rsquo;s Enterprise and Culture Committee, who are calling for a national strategic framework for wind farm developments; calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the UK Government does not introduce any charging scheme for access to the grid that discriminates against renewables in Scotland; believes that no new nuclear power stations should be built in Scotland, and calls for the Scottish Parliament to have control over energy policy and oil and gas revenues.&rdquo; </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2320.3 Shiona Baird:Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2320) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from &ldquo;is concerned&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;welcomes the political consensus that climate change is a reality and that alternatives to fossil fuel energy sources must be developed in order to curtail emissions of greenhouse gases; strongly believes that Scotland&rsquo;s energy future requires a wide range of environmentally-sustainable energy sources; agrees with the Enterprise and Culture Committee&rsquo;s Inquiry into renewable energy that Scotland needs to develop urgently all forms of renewable energy including marine, on and off-shore wind and solar sources; believes that a much greater focus on energy efficiency across all sectors must be central to any energy policy; notes the International Atomic Energy Agency&rsquo;s view that nuclear power will be unable to halt climate change and considers that the case for nuclear power in Scotland&rsquo;s long-term energy future remains completely unconvincing, and calls for more powers over energy policy to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.&rdquo; </p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2291.1 Frances Curran:Budget (Scotland) (No.2) Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2291) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, leave out from &ldquo;agrees&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;does not agree to the general principles of the Budget (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill because it believes that the budget is insufficient to avoid job losses in the public sector and that the efficiency savings will lead to less efficient public services, is insufficient to protect, let alone improve, the pay and conditions of public sector workers, is insufficient to implement equal pay for women and is based on further fragmentation and privatisation of public services.&rdquo; </p>
