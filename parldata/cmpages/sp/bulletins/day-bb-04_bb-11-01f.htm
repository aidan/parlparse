          <p><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1921</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Open Source and Free Software</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the findings of the Office of Government Commerce&rsquo;s report following proof-of-concept trials of Open Source software; notes that the report concludes that Open Source software is a viable and credible alternative to proprietary software and that its use can generate significant savings in hardware and software costs and reduce licensing costs and hardware refresh requirements; notes the significant financial and environmental benefit that could arise from a policy of adopting Open Source software, including the GNU/Linux operating system; notes the long-term dangers for organisations in becoming locked into proprietary systems; further believes that the principles of free software and concepts such as Copyleft can help to protect important rights and freedoms for people in an increasingly digital age, and urges the Scottish Executive to develop a strategy for promoting the adoption of free software and Open Source wherever workable throughout the public sector and to ensure that all software developed with public funds is copylefted.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1920</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>British Council Scotland and International Education Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the importance of international projects and activities that are taking place in schools, universities and colleges across Scotland; recognises that an international dimension in the curriculum enhances the quality, variety and relevance of education and acknowledges its contribution to the professional development of teachers, and welcomes the British Council Scotland&rsquo;s information stand highlighting these activities which will be in the garden lobby of Holyrood on 16 and 17 November 2004 and the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s annual international education conference in Victoria Quay on 23 November 2004, both of which are taking place during International Education Week.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1919</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Best Wishes to Fidel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its best wishes for a speedy recovery to the Cuban President, Fidel Castro, in respect of his recent fall in Havana and recognises the enormously positive role that he has played over the last 45 years in turning his country from a brutal tyranny into an island that prioritises the health and education of its citizens and the export of peace and human solidarity across the world.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1918</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Powers over Casinos</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the growing opposition to the Gambling Bill recently launched by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government in Westminster; believes that claims that the proposed regional casinos to be allowed under the Bill will boost urban regeneration are much over-stated; is concerned that the Bill is likely to lead to a significant rise in gambling addiction in Scotland; is aware that experience in countries like Australia shows that the problems occur disproportionately in deprived areas, and believes that key decisions on whether or not to allow the licensing of facilities like this should be a matter for decision in Scotland as part of other planning and licensing legislation and that consideration should be given to passing the appropriate powers to the Scottish Parliament in this area.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1917</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Clocks in the Chamber</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the positioning of the electronic clocks in the Chamber should be such as to enable all Members, in every seat, to read the time.</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1916#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Cuts in Local Benefits Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses great concern about the impact of the proposed cuts by the Department of Work and Pensions in local provision of benefits advice; regrets the likely reduction in benefits uptake by many vulnerable people; deplores the unfair geographical spread of the cuts, leaving Grampian, Tayside and Fife without any local offices; recognises the consequential increased workload that will fall on local authority and voluntary sector money advice services, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to protect the interests and incomes of the vulnerable in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Roseanna Cunningham, Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1915#</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> <strong>St John&rsquo;s Hospital, Livingston</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the emergency and major general surgery services in operation at St John&rsquo;s Hospital, Livingston, until 27 September 2004 should be restored with all possible speed and certainly as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Phil Gallie</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1914</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Voting Irregularities in the US Presidential Elections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the reports of voting irregularities already emanating from the US presidential elections and offers the expertise of Members of the Scottish Parliament in an observer role to ensure that the United States of America is able to conduct a full and fair democratic election.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Eleanor Scott, Rob Gibson</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1913</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Draft Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 Modification Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the draft Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 Modification Order 2004 be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1912#</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Pools Companies Holding Scottish Football to Ransom</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the decision by Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters football pools companies to cease payment to the Scottish Football League (SFL) of copyright payments for the right to use SFL fixtures in their pools games; notes that, for this season, the SFL was scheduled to receive around &pound;600,000, which would have meant an income of some &pound;20,000 for each club; recognises that 20% of the SFL&rsquo;s commercial income comes from this source and that this decision will have a major impact on the finances of every member club of the SFL, and therefore believes that the three pools companies should reverse the decision.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Rob Gibson, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Bruce Crawford, Alex Neil, Stewart Stevenson, Donald Gorrie, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1911</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>Investigation into Pregnancy Discrimination</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the first ever investigation into pregnancy discrimination which has been launched by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC); notes with concern that the EOC helpline receives more calls from women facing problems at work because of pregnancy than on any other subject; further expresses alarm that women have been demoted, disciplined or sacked simply for having a baby; strongly believes that the Scottish economy needs the skills and experience in the workplace of pregnant women and women returning from maternity leave, and calls on the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to act upon the findings of the investigation to put a stop to pregnancy discrimination.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dr Elaine Murray, Michael McMahon, Margaret Jamieson, Donald Gorrie, Brian Adam, Ms Wendy Alexander, Susan Deacon, Pauline McNeill<strong>*</strong>, Kate Maclean<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Elaine Smith<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenneth Macintosh<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Helen Eadie<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1910</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>John Peel</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament mourns the passing of John Peel; regards his outstanding and lasting contribution to popular culture in the UK as unique; notes that he was responsible for bringing a diverse range of music to generations of young and old alike through his radio shows, championing everything from punk rock to reggae and hip hop; notes particularly that he gave help and assistance to many Scottish bands who would have otherwise been unable to make progress in an industry that is over-dominated by the multinational record labels, and believes that his legacy will last forever in the music that he so dearly loved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson, Scott Barrie, Michael Matheson, Jackie Baillie, Alex Neil, Donald Gorrie</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1909</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Parenting Across Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 25 to 31 October 2004 is National Parenting Week; notes the publication of a MORI poll, commissioned by Parenting Across Scotland (PAS), a multi-agency partnership led by Children 1st and funded by the Scottish Executive, the findings of which include that two-thirds of adults questioned believe that bringing up children today is more difficult than when they were young and that materialism and financial pressure, discipline, children&rsquo;s safety and work-life balance are the main reasons for this, that love, affection and a good stable upbringing are seen as the most important factors in raising children and that over two-thirds of adults were not aware of any organisations that provide advice and support to parents, and believes that this poll, and other research being undertaken by PAS, should be used to inform policy and service development and help ensure that greater support is offered to parents and families across Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dr Elaine Murray, Bruce Crawford, Eleanor Scott, Mr Jamie Stone, Margaret Jamieson, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Sarah Boyack, Carolyn Leckie, Brian Adam, Marlyn Glen, Des McNulty, Mrs Mary Mulligan, Scott Barrie, Mike Pringle, Chris Ballance, Colin Fox, Christine May, Ms Sandra White, Robert Brown, Margaret Smith, Cathie Craigie, Alex Neil, Elaine Smith, Mary Scanlon, Donald Gorrie, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenneth Macintosh<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1904</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> <strong>Deplorable Comments by Bruce McFee MSP</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the description of the Union Flag as a &quot;butcher&rsquo;s apron&quot; by Bruce McFee MSP; calls on Mr McFee to withdraw his statement and to apologise for this offensive slur on the flag of the Black Watch battle group, and deplores this implied attack on the exemplary conduct of Scottish military personnel serving in the peacekeeping force in Iraq.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone, Murdo Fraser, Phil Gallie, Dr Elaine Murray, Mike Pringle, Mr David Davidson, Des McNulty, Mr Frank McAveety, Trish Godman, Ms Wendy Alexander, Margaret Jamieson, Helen Eadie, Scott Barrie, Alex Johnstone, Janis Hughes, Mr Duncan McNeil, Cathie Craigie, Mr Brian Monteith, Mr Alasdair Morrison<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1903</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>10th Anniversary of the National Lottery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the National Lottery is currently celebrating its 10th anniversary; further notes the lack of support for good causes in Scotland and therefore congratulates the Fair Share funding initiative which is designed to target lottery money at areas, including specific areas in Glasgow, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire and Dundee, which have not received a fair share of lottery funds in the past, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to work with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to set up a not-for-profit Scottish lottery with the funds raised by lottery customers in Scotland being exclusively used for the benefit of the people, communities and organisations in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Neil</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1902#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Commonwealth of Learning Award for Open University Access Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Open University&rsquo;s (OU) short course programme &quot;Openings&quot; consists of short flexible courses designed to give students, particularly from under-represented groups, an experience of OU study, the intention of which is to bridge the divide between further and higher education and to give students clear pathways for their future development; congratulates the OU for winning the prestigious Commonwealth of Learning Award for excellence in distance education materials at the recent pan-commonwealth conference in New Zealand for its &quot;Understanding Children&quot; course, part of the Openings programme, which has received international recognition for giving over 36,000 people a stepping stone into higher education; notes that the course was praised for its &quot;innovative approach to designing, developing and implementing an access course&quot;; notes that the quality of the multi-media course materials and the level of support provided to students were also given special mention; commemorates the 100th anniversary on 3 November 2004 of the birth of Jenny Lee, formerly Labour MP and Baroness Lee of Asheridge, the founder of the Open University and celebrates the fact that Jenny Lee, wife of Aneurin Bevan, was born and lived her early life in Cowdenbeath, in the Dunfermline East constituency, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider a service of commemoration not only to celebrate Jenny Lee&rsquo;s life but also to mark the amazing achievements and contribution which the Open University continues to make to our world.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Chris Ballance, Cathie Craigie, Sarah Boyack, Dr Elaine Murray, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Tommy Sheridan, John Swinburne, Elaine Smith, Donald Gorrie, Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1901</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Proposed National Front March in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen City councillors on their brave decision to ban a proposed march by the National Front and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward legislation to ensure that local councillors representing local opinion can make decisions on proposed future marches without fear of oppressive punishment.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Bill Butler, Scott Barrie, Michael Matheson, Alex Neil, Donald Gorrie</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1900#</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Deafblindness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the European Parliament Declaration of Rights of Deafblind people which was formally adopted on 1 April 2004 and recognises deafblindness as a distinct disability separate from hearing or sight impairment; considers that more should be done to identify, correctly assess and provide appropriate services for this unique group who cannot automatically benefit from mainstream services or services for people who are either blind or deaf, and further considers that councils should make appropriate provision for this uniquely disadvantaged group, ensuring that they have the same provision of services as outlined in the guidance issued under section 7(1) of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 for England and Wales.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Neil, Mr David Davidson, Murray Tosh, Fergus Ewing, Mary Scanlon, Chris Ballance, Donald Gorrie, David McLetchie, Robert Brown, Mrs Nanette Milne, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Phil Gallie<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, John Scott<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1897</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>First ScotRail Anti-Violence Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the poster campaign by First ScotRail and the British Transport Police highlighting the physical and verbal abuse that many rail workers face in the course of their working lives; believes that nobody should have to endure the threat of violence at work and that drawing attention to this problem and educating people about the consequences of their actions is a positive step, and congratulates First Scotrail and the British Transport Police for taking the first step towards tackling this serious problem.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Donald Gorrie, Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1896#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Proposals to Deregulate Gambling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent publication of the Gambling Bill by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government; notes that the deregulation of gambling proposed in this Bill will lead to more casinos being built and that it is highly likely that more problem gambling will result; further notes with concern the dismissal of the legitimate concerns of those opposed to the proposals by Tessa Jowell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, as being &quot;a whiff of snobbery&quot;, and believes that such comments are unworthy of a government minister and should be retracted.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Michael Matheson</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1893#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the comments of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Patricia Hewitt, that getting rid of &quot;career sexism&quot; is vital to closing the gender pay gap but regrets that the Scottish Executive utterly failed the nursery nurses on this very issue during their three-and-a-half-month-long strike over pay; notes that this group of workers, 95% of whom are women, have suffered &quot;career sexism&quot; for far too long resulting in pay discrimination; considers that the Executive should be ashamed of itself for sitting on its hands and doing nothing when over 4,000, mainly women, workers took to the streets, and fully supports any nursery nurses who take up the advice of the Equal Opportunities Commission to pursue the issue of pay equality through employment tribunals.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, Rosie Kane, Shiona Baird, Tommy Sheridan, Patrick Harvie, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>

          <p>Supported by: Mr Andrew Welsh, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Alex Neil, Michael Matheson, Donald Gorrie</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1881</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Energy Efficiency Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Energy Efficiency Week between 25 and 31 October 2004&nbsp;and recognises the report, <em>Forecasting The Future</em>, published by the Energy Saving Trust to launch the week; notes with concern the report&rsquo;s findings that climate change could result in &pound;200 billion of property and infrastructure damage from flooding and coastal erosion in the United Kingdom by 2050; notes with concern that <em>Key Scottish Environment Statistics 2004,</em> published by the Scottish Executive, shows that Scotland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change are again increasing; notes with concern the lack of a specific Scottish target for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; regards energy efficiency as an essential way of reducing emissions that contribute to climate&nbsp;change, and&nbsp;recognises that measures, such as improving the energy efficiency of Scotland&rsquo;s housing stock, will also reduce the impact of fuel poverty but &nbsp;also that any improvements in energy efficiency in the home are being undermined by transport policies that promote ever greater car use and more and more air travel and that support for action on energy efficiency by any group or political party must be matched by calls for abandoning road-building projects such as the M74 and the Aberdeen&nbsp;bypass and abandoning support for expanding air travel that will lead to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell, Patrick Harvie, Eleanor Scott, Mark Ballard, Chris Ballance, Robin Harper, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Tommy Sheridan</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1880#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Vote for Trade Justice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the mass lobby of the Scottish Parliament in support of the Vote for Trade Justice campaign between 12 and 2 pm on 27 October 2004; further notes that each Member of the Scottish Parliament has been challenged to cast their vote for trade justice in a giant trade justice ballot box; also notes that Elaine C Smith will chair an open-air rally in support of trade justice, and believes that members should support the reform of unjust and unfair trade rules, for which the trade justice campaign calls, through this and other actions.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1879</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (Orkney) (No.4) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (Orkney) (No.4) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/417) be approved.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1674#</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Development and Manufacture of Renewable Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Highlands and Islands Renewable Energy Group and the trade union Amicus on their initiative to promote the development and manufacture of renewable energy structures, whether for wind, wave or tidal power, in the Highlands and Islands; recognises that there is a skilled engineering workforce available locally; further recognises the considerable socio-economic benefits that would flow from this work to the nearby communities; believes that renewable energy infrastructure would be better supported by these communities if they perceived that it was bringing local economic benefit, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should do all it can to support Highland-based companies in bidding for renewables contracts in Scotland and elsewhere.</p>
