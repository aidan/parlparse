<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1226</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Chair of Scottish Youth Parliament on Big Brother TV Show</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with interest the appearance of John Loughton, Chair of the Scottish Youth Parliament and co-vice convener of the Cross Party Group for Children and Young People, in the Big Brother reality television show; notes the opportunity that such ventures provide to engage with large numbers of those who traditionally do not participate in established political structures; believes that such new methods of engagement are useful for evolving parliamentary democracy and ensuring that it remains relevant to the people, and further believes that Scotland&rsquo;s Youth Parliament provides excellent role models for today&rsquo;s young Scots and that John deserves the support of all Big Brother viewers in Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1225&diams; </strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Heart at Risk Screening for Young Sportsmen and Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that cardiomyopathy, a thickening of the heart muscles, grows undetected at the body&rsquo;s fastest growing time, the teenage years; further notes that apparently healthy teenagers can suffer from this condition and that the condition kills a large number of teenagers annually; commends the work of Scottish HART (Heart at Risk Testing), a Borders-based national charity which researches into all heart diseases, especially cardiomyopathy, raises funds for a mobile screening unit which, with trained staff, will test the health of all young Scottish athletes, campaigns for defibrillators, researches all forms of heart disease, raises funds for mobile screening of young people and families at risk and has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to put monitoring equipment into sports centres, swimming pools and youth facilities across Scotland, and considers that the advantages and practicalities of providing screening for young people who, because of family history or the nature of their activities such as strenuous competitive sport, may be at risk of an early, sudden and preventable death, should be investigated through a pilot scheme, possibly in the Scottish Borders.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1224</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Education and Skills Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the Education and Skills Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 28 November 2007, to make provision within the legislative competence of the Parliament and to alter the executive competence of Scottish Ministers in respect of using and sharing information in relation to skills and training of people in Scotland, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Maureen Watt<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1223</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Draft Community Care (Personal Care and Nursing Care) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that the draft Community Care (Personal Care and Nursing Care) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2008 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1222</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>UCAN (Grampian)</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates UCAN (Grampian) on its success in securing &pound;590,096 in Life Transitions grant from the Big Lottery: Investing in Communities fund; notes that good projects supported by strong applications can bring significant sums in funding; commends the work done by others to raise funds for UCAN, and notes that this award will enable patients and their families across Aberdeen and the north east to benefit from treatment and support at Foresterhill.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-765#</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Extra-curricular Outdoor Education for Every School Pupil</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vital contribution that taking part in extra-curricular activities makes in developing our young people; notes that extra-curricular programmes help our young people to learn new skills, to enjoy new responsibility, to appreciate the work of other people and to learn about leadership; notes the success of projects such as Crieff High School&rsquo;s Community Awareness Project, and considers that, in an age when too many of our young people are in the headlines for the wrong reasons and when there are increasing concerns about school discipline and the numbers of youngsters involved in incidents of antisocial behaviour, extra-curricular activities in schools and five days outdoor education for every school pupil in Scotland should be supported.</p>
