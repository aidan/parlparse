<p><strong>S2W-30648</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive why it started a process of reviewing nursing in the community and committing public funds to it before the recommendations of <em>Nursing for Health: A review of the contribution of nurses, midwives and health visitors to improving the public&rsquo;s health in Scotland</em> and <em>Nursing For Health: Two Years On</em> had been implemented.</p>
<p><strong>S2W-30649</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the publication of <em>Visible, Accessible and Integrated Care - Report of the Review of Nursing in the Community in Scotland</em>, whether it considers that the timescale for the review was sufficient and what the reasons are for the length of time (a) taken for and (b) given to implement the review.</p>

<p><strong>S2W-30666</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the publication of <em>Visible, Accessible and Integrated Care - Report of the Review of Nursing in the Community in Scotland</em> and given that the review suggests that clients will become central to the delivery of community nursing, what evidence there is that this has not always been the case.</p>
