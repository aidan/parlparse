          <p><strong>*S1M-2485#</strong> <strong>Mike Watson: Cross-Party Support 
            for a Review of Construction in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            recognises the importance of the construction industry to the Scottish 
            economy and the contribution it makes to supporting employment and 
            vocational education and training; notes that nine out of every 10 
            construction firms employ less than eight people; acknowledges that 
            the reputation of the whole industry is damaged by the actions of 
            rogue traders, particularly within the residential sector and that 
            small businesses contend that their profitability and competitiveness 
            is adversely affected by the system of cash retentions, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should initiate a strategic review of 
            construction in Scotland in order to (a) identify how best to combat 
            the &quot;cowboy&quot; element, (b) support the education and training 
            infrastructure so that it is able to meet the skill requirements of 
            the industry, (c) examine the possibility of developing an inspection 
            and assessment regime to evaluate the competence of construction companies, 
            (d) address the system of cash retentions and (e) ensure that the 
            provisions within the existing construction contracts legislation 
            deliver a process that is fair, effective and easy to understand.

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2470.1</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson: Birthplace 
            of John Muir in Dunbar</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-2470) 
            in the name of Michael Russell, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out 
            from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the initiative 
            taken by the John Muir Birthplace Trust to develop the John Muir Birthplace 
            in Dunbar High Street as a fitting tribute to the creator of America&#146;s 
            national parks and the father of modern environmentalism and as a 
            centre to promote understanding of our natural environment; acknowledges 
            the widespread support for this proposal in Dunbar and elsewhere following 
            consultation on the planning application to East Lothian Council; 
            notes the conclusion of the conservation architect Nicholas Groves-Raines 
            that the building had been gutted in the 1970s with the result that 
            none of the original interior features remain to be conserved; is 
            confident that the sensitive redevelopment of the John Muir Birthplace 
            will attract substantially more visitors than the 2,028, of whom only 
            3% were Americans, who visited the centre this year; endorses the 
            decision of the Scottish Executive to grant consent for the necessary 
            alterations to this important listed building, and welcomes the support 
            of the Heritage Lottery Fund for this excellent initiative.&quot;</a></p>
