          <p><strong>*S1M-2740</strong> <strong> Roseanna Cunningham: Review of 
            Older People's Services in Perth and Kinross</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the recent publication by the Scottish Health Advisory 
            Service (SHAS) of their <em>Review of Older People's Services in Perth 
            and Kinross </em>which found<em> </em>that &quot;there is effectively 
            no planned NHS continuing care for frail older people in Perth and 
            Kinross which is inequitable with the rest of Scotland and should 
            be addressed as a matter of urgency&quot;; further notes the report's 
            recognition of the problems being caused by &quot;bed-blocking&quot; 
            at Perth Royal Infirmary and that a number of the recommendations 
            made following SHAS's last visit in 1998 have not been acted on; expresses 
            the view that the closure of local authority-owned residential homes 
            would exacerbate the problem of care provision and add to the existing 
            anxieties of older people in Perth and Kinross, and calls on the Minister 
            for Health and Community Care, NHS Tayside and Perth and Kinross Council 
            to work together to provide the elderly of Perth and Kinross with 
            the service they deserve.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2739#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Glasgow City 
            Council and Free Breakfasts</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Glasgow City Council for rolling out its free daily breakfasts to 
            every pupil at primary schools in the city; notes that the pilot project 
            starting in 20 Glasgow primary schools in February 2002 will provide 
            children with a choice of toast and cereals with milk, fruit juice 
            or water and that yoghurt, raisins and fresh fruit will also be piloted; 
            further notes that the free breakfast plan complements the Council's 
            other initiatives of free fruit three days a week to all 60,000 primary 
            and nursery children and free swimming at Council pools for all children 
            under the age of 18, and believes that these initiatives will go a 
            long way to improving the diet and health of children in Glasgow as 
            well as providing improved chances for better learning.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2738</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Glasgow Underground</strong>-That

            Authority (SPTA) not to increase the fares on the Glasgow Underground 
            from 90p to £1.00; notes that this fare freeze will ensure that the 
            Glasgow Underground remains an accessible, environmentally friendly 
            and affordable alternative to cars for many Glaswegians and visitors 
            to the city; further notes that 95% of passengers report their satisfaction 
            with the Underground service, confirming that it remains the quickest 
            and most reliable way of getting around Glasgow, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to work with SPTA to find alternative means of 
            securing the extra £220,000 to cover the costs of essential repairs 
            and to upgrade the system. </p>

          <p><strong>*S1M-2731#</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Macmillan Cancer 
            Relief - Cancer Talk</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Macmillan 
            Cancer Relief on its important and innovative educational programme, 
            Cancer Talk; notes that Cancer Talk is key to realising the charity's 
            vision of tackling unnecessary levels of fear about cancer by raising 
            awareness and dispelling myths in the classroom; further notes that 
            over two hundred Scottish schools have signed up to Cancer Talk, with 
            several keen to publicise it within their local media and community, 
            especially during the week beginning 4 March 2002; urges members to 
            contact their local schools in order to encourage them to get involved 
            in integrating Cancer Talk within their existing curriculum both during 
            that week and afterwards; recognises the need for the Scottish Executive 
            to consider the incorporation of Cancer Talk formally within the schools' 
            curriculum, and believes that such incorporation would be a major 
            source of help and support to the many schoolchildren, parents and 
            teachers whose lives are touched by cancer each year.</p>

            its operations into Scotland by opening five &quot;sex multiplexes&quot;; 
            further notes recent reports linking Spearmint Rhino with pornographic 
            websites featuring the drugging, abduction and rape of women, and 
            therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to investigate this matter
