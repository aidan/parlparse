<p><strong>Questions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>S3W-20907</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has had discussions with the UK Government about providing access to the UK bus network for pensioners who are entitled to use the national concessionary travel scheme and, if not, whether it will make representations to the UK Government on this matter.</p>

<p><strong>S3W-20934</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the review of the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP) by Peter Cook will include a survey of the cost to crofters and farmers of preparing applications for support from the scheme and will compare that cost with the cost of applying to the agricultural support schemes that the SRDP replaced.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-20935</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the review of the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP) by Peter Cook will include a survey to assess the percentage of crofters and farmers who employed an agent to prepare their applications for support from the scheme and will compare that percentage with the percentage that used agents to prepare applications for support under the agricultural support schemes that the SRDP replaces.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-20936</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the review of the Scotland Rural Development Programme by Peter Cook will investigate how many crofters and farmers have encountered difficulties in making their online applications for support from the scheme and how many did not apply or did not complete an application because applications could only be made online.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-20937</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the review of the Scotland Rural Development Programme by Peter Cook will assess whether sufficient government staff resources had been provided so that applicants whose applications have failed can be given detailed advice on the reasons for their rejection and on how their applications could be amended in order to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-20938</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many stages will follow the first stage of the review of the Scotland Rural Development Programme by Peter Cook; whether it will provide details of the work to be undertaken in those stages, and what the expected duration is of each stage.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-20939</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when any changes to the terms of the Scotland Rural Development Programme that could be made as the result of the review by Peter Cook are expected to be made.</p>

<p><strong>S3W-20941</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether applicants to the Scotland Rural Development Programme whose applications are turned down, either by a Regional Proposal Assessment Committee (RPAC) or by Scottish ministers, will receive a full written explanation setting out the detailed reasons for rejection of their applications and copies of all documentation considered by the RPAC or by ministers.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-20942</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-19341 by Shona Robison on 20 January 2009, whether it will provide an answer that specifically addresses the points raised in the question.</p>
