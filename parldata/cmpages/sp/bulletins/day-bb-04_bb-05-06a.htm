            welcomes the results of the recent Keep Scotland Beautiful survey 
            of resort beaches with the granting of Seaside Awards to 40 Scottish 
            beaches including 14 new recipients; acknowledges the impact of beach 
            litter as highlighted in the recent Marine Conservation Society's 
            Beachwatch 2003 Report; commends the partnership approach taken between 
            the Scottish Executive and other bodies to help address the issues 
            raised in Beachwatch 2003; endorses the continuation of that approach, 
            and encourages the public to take more responsibility for its own 
            litter to ensure that Scotland's beaches continue to be a valued and 
            productive national resource. </P>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>

            of continuing improvement in bathing water quality in Scotland to 
            the quality of our beaches and believes that further progress is now 
            dependent on addressing the limitations of Scottish Water and the

            of Seaside Awards to 40 Scottish beaches including 14 new recipients, 
            acknowledges the impact of beach litter as highlighted in the recent 
            Marine Conservation Society's Beachwatch 2003 Report; notes that the 
            report's findings include a net increase in beach litter and that 
            sewage-related debris accounts for a higher proportion of beach litter 
            in Scotland than elsewhere in the United Kingdom; further notes that, 
            while encouraging the public to take more responsibility for its own 
            litter, the report also states that determined efforts are required 
            to reduce pollution at source and that local authorities, water authorities 
            and Her Majesty's Government must play their part in reducing and 
            cleaning up litter; further notes that the environmental quality of 
            beaches encompasses much more than litter alone, and calls upon the 
            Scottish Executive to display a strong lead following the consultation 
            on the best strategy for protecting and enhancing all of Scotland's 
            coastline as pledged in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em>,

          <p>&#9;<strong>S2M-1071</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Loch 
            Lomond Rescue Boat</strong>-That the Parliament warmly acknowledges 
            the work of the Loch Lomond Rescue Boat; values the service it provides 
            to local communities and visitors enjoying the delights of Loch Lomond; 
            pays tribute to the dedication of the volunteers, who all give freely 
            of their own time to run the service; recognises the importance of 
            their work in promoting and teaching all aspects of safety in and 
            around Loch Lomond, particularly for water sports; notes that a substantial 
            portion of the annual funding is raised by the efforts of volunteers, 
            and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate 
            the provision of stable funding, similar to that provided for mountain 
            rescue teams, to support this essential, life-saving service. </P>
