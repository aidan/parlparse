<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#END">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4944</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Stop the Park Gallery Closing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision by the Labour, Conservative and Independent-led administration of Falkirk Council to close the Park Gallery in Falkirk; believes that Falkirk Council&rsquo;s decision to close the Park Gallery is lamentable, given that it is one of only two outlets for contemporary art in the Forth Valley area; notes the lack of public consultation by Falkirk Council prior to taking this decision, and therefore calls on Falkirk Council to recognise the widespread opposition within the community to this plan and that a full public consultation exercise should be undertaken to ensure that the views of the local community are taken into account on the future of this important community asset.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4943</strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Design Team the Best in the World</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the technical and production arts staff and students of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD), Hazel Blue, Martin Mallorie, Simon Cadell, Kelli Des Jalais, Katrina Kelly and Pouleng Mabuya, who have just been given the award of World&rsquo;s Best Design Team at the World Stage Design Exhibition 2009, held in Seoul, South Korea; notes that the RSAMD won in a field of literally thousands of applications and beat two professional production crews for the top prize; recognises that the RSAMD team is made up of members from across the world, reflecting the international make-up of the academy, and looks forward to the further contribution of RSAMD students and graduates to the cultural life of Scotland and the world.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4942</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Inverclyde Community Maternity Unit Must Remain 24/7</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, despite NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde agreeing, in August 2008, to retain a community maternity unit (CMU) at Inverclyde Royal Hospital for a further three years while a community education programme was run to promote the benefits of the CMU, the board has now decided to change the operations of the CMU from 24/7 to an on-call service at nights and weekends, which clearly reduces the attractiveness of the CMU as no-one can predict the hour of a baby&rsquo;s arrival; condemns the board&rsquo;s petulant response to the recommendations of the Independent Scrutiny Panel, and calls on the board to deliver the undertakings that it gave in August 2008 in full and drop its proposals to convert the CMU at Inverclyde Royal Hospital to a 9 am to 5 pm service.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4941</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Doors Open Day Proves a Hit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of Glasgow&rsquo;s Doors Open Day, now in its 20th year, which ran from Thursday 17 to Sunday 20 September 2009, with thousands of people taking the opportunity to look inside some of the city&rsquo;s most historic and interesting buildings, including theatres, churches and galleries; notes that entry was completely free, and applauds new arts hub Trongate 103, which welcomed 2,250 visitors through its doors, as well as venues such as Glasgow&rsquo;s Police Museum, which welcomed 1,200 people, the Glasgow Steiner School, which welcomed 400 people, and the Glasgow Art Club on Bath Street, which had around 300 visitors.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4940</strong> <strong>Duncan McNeil on behalf of the Local Government and Communities Committee:</strong> <strong>Report on Equal Pay in Local Government</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Local Government and Communities Committee&rsquo;s 12th Report 2009 (Session 3): <em>Equal Pay in Local Government </em>(SP Paper 292).</p>
