<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8032 Keith Brown: Fuel Duty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that petrol and diesel prices in Scotland are among the highest in Europe and have reached record levels and that the planned rise in fuel duty by the UK Government in April 2011 could increase prices by a further 4p per litre; recognises that such increases impose an additional burden on households and businesses at a time of rising living costs and could undermine the economic recovery; notes the UK Government&rsquo;s proposal to introduce a 5p-per-litre fuel discount scheme for island communities, and calls on the UK Government to cancel the rise in fuel duty planned for April and implement a fuel duty regulator that would ensure that some of the additional revenue that the UK Government will receive from increased revenues due to recent increases in oil prices is used to reduce fuel duty to help support Scottish households and businesses.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-8031 Liam McArthur: Ness of Brodgar Excavations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that ongoing excavations on the Ness of Brodgar, on the Orkney mainland, have won the Research Project of the Year award at the 2011 Current Archaeology Awards; further notes that the excavations, which are uncovering a large Neolithic complex on the Brodgar peninsula lying on the low ridge between the Stones of Stenness and the Ring of Brodgar, were runner-up in the Andante Travel Archaeology Awards 2008 and were listed by the American Institute of Archaeology as one of the great discoveries of 2009; believes that the complex uncovered by the excavations is further evidence of the rich archaeology of Orkney, both in the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site and across the islands, and congratulates Nick Card of the Orkney Research Centre for Archaeology, the director of the excavations, and his team on their award.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8030 Bill Butler: Fairtrade Fortnight 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Fairtrade Fortnight, which runs from 28 February to 13 March 2011; applauds the efforts of church groups, charities, businesses, schools and individuals in promoting the benefits of fair trade in Scotland; believes that the fair trade movement has made a huge difference to the lives of thousands of people and communities across the globe; considers that the co-operative movement has played a pioneering role in the advancement of fair trade; further considers that the fair trade concept is based on traditional co-operative principles of community ownership, concern for communities and democratic membership control; notes that estimated sales of fair trade products across the United Kingdom rose by 40% last year to more than &pound;1 billion; considers that the Scottish Fair Trade Forum (SFTF), established in January 2007, is a continuing success, and encourages schools, local authorities, further and higher education establishments and businesses to sign up to the SFTF&rsquo;s Countdown Campaign, which will feature a year of events building up to 2012 when the forum will submit Scotland&rsquo;s bid to become a Fair Trade Nation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8029 Patricia Ferguson: Property Factors (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Property Factors (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-8028 Bill Butler: Damages (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Damages (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8027 Robin Harper: Seal Culls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Government has just issued licences to shoot up to 1,300 seals in 2011 where it is considered that they present a threat to fish farms; recalls that, under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, culling to control seals is a solution of last resort; considers that 80% of fish farms have not complied with guidance to the effect that non-lethal methods of controlling seals, including acoustic warnings, precautionary siting and double netting, should be employed if there is a danger of seal predation, and urges the Scottish Government to include current advice in regulation in order to reduce the perceived requirement for shooting licences and to consider producing a long-term plan to introduce closed containment for all fish farming activities in Scotland, whether land or sea based.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8026 John Wilson: Youth Health Day @ Chryston Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Chryston High School on the success of its recent Youth Health Day @ Chryston event, held on 26 February 2011, to encourage healthy living for young people; applauds the hard work that it considers was put in by the event organisers and all who assisted in making the day such a success; notes that this event was supported and funded by NHS Lanarkshire and the Northern Corridor Community Forum, and acknowledges the widespread support from the people who turned out for the event, local groups, local health-related agencies and children and families from the local communities in the northern corridor.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8025 Margaret Mitchell: Hamilton College and Scottish Opera</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hamilton College&rsquo;s J6 and J7 pupils on their recent performance of <em>Scotland, Our Scotland!</em>; notes that this was part of Scottish Opera&rsquo;s Primary Schools Tours 2011-13 programme; acknowledges that Scottish Opera works with approximately 20,000 children annually by touring with three different shows for pupils in P5 to P7 covering subjects such as identity, citizenship, energy and geography; notes that the moral of <em>Scotland, Our Scotland!</em> is that much more can be achieved by working together instead of against each other; considers that this was an excellent performance providing a high quality experience for the children and that, by working with professional musicians and technicians and their props and equipment, it developed their singing, movement and performance skills, and hopes that many other schools will be able to enjoy the Scottish Opera experience and that the Hamilton College pupils will be inspired to continue acting, singing and performing.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8024 Willie Coffey: The Co-operative Model, Born in Fenwick, 14 March 1761, Still Flourishing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 250th anniversary of the founding of the Fenwick Weavers Society in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun village of Fenwick as a significant milestone in the development of co-operative enterprises in Scotland and throughout the world; welcomes plans to recognise the founding of the society, which was recorded in the signing of a charter in Fenwick Parish Church on 14 March 1761, in a range of projects organised by the modern-day Fenwick Weavers Society in co-operation with East Ayrshire Council and with the support of a wide range of funders; notes that the projects will include the building of a commemorative wall on the spot in Fenwick where the weavers held their parliament and by the signing of a modern Fenwick Charter, to take place in the same church on 14 March 2011; further notes that the Fenwick Weavers Society has been described as &quot;the oldest example of distributive Co-operation of which there is documentary evidence&quot; and also as &quot;probably the pioneer of what is now described as the &lsquo;Co-operative supply association&rsquo;&quot;; highlights that among those signing the Fenwick Charter will be Scots from all walks of life including Scotland&rsquo;s growing co-operative sector, representatives of UK co-operative bodies, including Co-operatives UK and the Co-operative Group, the president and director general of the International Co-operative Alliance and a representative of the MONDRAGON Corporation, a co-operative group founded in 1956 that now has over 85,000 employees and plants in 18 countries, the largest business group in the Basque Country and seventh largest in Spain; applauds the fact that the worldwide co-operative movement, of which the early roots are in Fenwick, now brings together over one billion members, providing in excess of 100 million jobs, and considers that, in addition to being an important part of Scotland&rsquo;s history, co-operative enterprises offer Scotland a viable, efficient and accountable means of organising to produce goods and services for their members, for the wider Scottish community and for export.</p>
