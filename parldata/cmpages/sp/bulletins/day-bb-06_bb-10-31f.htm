<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#fend">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5048</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Members&rsquo; Accommodation Allowances System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the Members&rsquo; accommodation allowances system needs to be urgently reformed as the current system has allowed Scottish taxpayers to be ripped off for the benefit of very well-paid politicians who profit from a parliament-assisted property scheme; notes that the First Minister supports reforming the Members&rsquo; accommodation allowance system but regrets that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) has not responded positively, and therefore calls on the SPCB to review urgently the accommodation allowances system which has become totally discredited in public opinion.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5047</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Children in Need at Home</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the forthcoming Children in Need appeal on BBC television; notes that there are still 240,000 children in Scotland, one in four, living in poverty; further notes that  many low-income families are unable to afford the cost of basics such as school uniforms and optional extras such as school trips; notes that many families with incomes below &pound;15,000 struggle to afford these costs while the children risk being isolated, stigmatised and bullied at school and falling behind with schoolwork; further notes that figures from the Department for Work and Pensions estimate that up to &pound;500 million of Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit goes unclaimed annually in Scotland; recognises that the UK Government is failing to make progress on take-up rates for means-tested benefits, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do everything in its power to address child poverty in Scotland, including investment in free health care for all, free education for all, decent and affordable social housing and an agricultural system based on producing healthy nutritious food for communities not for profit and to call on the UK Government to implement a taxation system based on the ability to pay, a national minimum wage and benefit system that affords families the dignity to maintain a normal family life and an end to means-tested benefit.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5046</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Children in Need Abroad</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the forthcoming Children in Need appeal on BBC television; notes that 30,000 children worldwide die each day due to poverty; further notes that infant and child mortality has been considerably slower during the last 25 years than in the previous two decades and that progress in education also slowed during the past 25 years; acknowledges that the number of children in the world is 2.2 billion and that 1 billion, every second child, live in poverty; further notes that, of the 1.9 billion children from the developing world, there are 640 million, one in three, without adequate shelter, 400 million, one in five, with no access to safe water and 270 million, one in seven, with no access to health services; notes that there are 121 million children worldwide out of education; further notes that 1.4 million children die each year from lack of access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation; recognises that, worldwide, 2.2 million children die each year because they are not immunised and that 15 million children have been orphaned due to HIV/AIDS, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do everything in its power to address child poverty worldwide, including extending aid programmes such as that in Malawi and putting pressure on the UK Government to cancel the debt of developing countries.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5045<> </strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Community Health</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the great importance of community health projects in tackling the health problems that our nation faces; believes that community, independent and voluntary sector organisations addressing health inequalities play a crucial role in meeting the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s targets on health improvement; in particular, congratulates the Edinburgh Community Food Initiative on 10 years of working to remove barriers to a healthy diet by consistently developing innovative and effective programmes such as the Snack Attack project; notes that the future of this project, like many others, depends on its ability to continue to identify, secure and manage a wide variety of short-term funding sources; notes with concern the sense of fragility across the sector due to the uncertainty inherent in the funding system, and considers that the Executive should show much greater support to community health projects and act to reduce the financial insecurity that they are forced to face.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5036</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>ARCH Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Association of Residents of Cliffburn and Hayshead (ARCH) in Arbroath on the award of &pound;1,000 in this year&rsquo;s Standing Up To Antisocial Behaviour Awards, for its continued work in tackling antisocial behaviour; applauds the association on its sustained and successful efforts to restore respect and pride in the community, and recognises its work as a fine example of communities working together that will set a worthy example for others in Scotland to follow.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5034</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Climate Change - A Moral Issue</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Africa &ndash; Up in Smoke?</em>, the second report by the new economics foundation on the impacts of climate change on Africa; congratulates all members of the Working Group on Climate Change and Development, the coalition of environmental, development and faith organisations responsible for the report; is reminded once again of the vulnerability of Africa to climatic variations causing drought, food shortages, desertification, conflict over water resources and increases in disease; notes the cruel paradox of climate change, that the harshest and most damaging impacts are frequently felt by those countries with the lowest carbon emissions, which are also the least able to afford the measures needed to adapt to a rapidly changing climate, and believes therefore that finding a global solution to climate change is a profoundly moral issue and that both the developed and the developing world must be involved in future international initiatives to tackle climate change.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5033</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Her Majesty the Queen Praises Independence</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes comments made by Her Majesty the Queen on a recent visit to Estonia where she praised Estonia&rsquo;s struggle for independence, stating &quot;Estonia&rsquo;s development since regaining its independence has been remarkable. Your entrepreneurial spirit, your innovative use of information and communication technology, and your open and transparent economic climate has resulted in dramatic growth, led by international trade and investment ... It is that indomitable spirit, which was able to keep alive the flame of independence, despite all attempts to extinguish it, during the very worst of times. It is this spirit which has driven forward the rapid political, economic and social change in all your countries, change which is not something to be measured simply by statistics, but in the freedom, peace and prosperity which all your peoples now enjoy&quot;; notes that the successful example of Estonia and subsequent comments from Her Majesty mirror the historic and current situation in Scotland, while expounding the many benefits independence brings, and hopes to receive similar praise from Her Majesty in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5032</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Climate Change - An Economic Issue</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes today&rsquo;s publication by Sir Nicholas Stern, Head of the UK Government economic service and former World Bank chief economist, of his report into the economics of climate change and congratulates all those involved in the production of the report; notes the report&rsquo;s finding that it will cost around 1% of global GDP to take early and effective action to tackle the causes of climate change while doing nothing could cost up to 20 times that amount; acknowledges Sir Nicholas&rsquo; warning that climate change, if nothing is done to address the problem, could cause a world recession comparable to the Wall Street crash and the Great Depression, with the world&rsquo;s poorest countries hit hardest and earliest; rejects as grossly misleading the notion that society must choose between a healthy environment on one hand and a healthy economy on the other and believes, instead, that in order for any kind of economic stability to exist, a stable environment is a fundamental prerequisite, and fervently hopes that the publication of this report will constitute a watershed moment in global political and public opinion, leading to a new willingness among politicians, of all complexions, to place action on climate change at the top of the political agenda, replacing the blinkered and dangerous fixation on economic growth.</p>
