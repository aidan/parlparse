    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-406</b> <strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: Children and Young People Looked After
    by Local Authorities</strong>&#151;That the Parliament endorses the important action being
    taken to improve the quality of care and support for every child and young person looked
    after by local authorities; supports strengthening key services for those young people
    through extra resources to develop more integrated approaches to their needs, new
    performance measures to highlight actual outcomes for each child, especially those leaving
    care, and research to evaluate how well those looked after at home are supported, and
    recognises the importance of ensuring that each and every child or young person looked
    after by local authorities can share fully in the benefits of education, health and social
    justice programmes.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-405</b> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Representation of People Bill</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament endorses the principle of ensuring consistency of absent voting provisions
    for parliamentary and local elections in Scotland as set out in the Representation of
    People Bill and agrees that the relevant provision to achieve this end in the Bill should
    be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-404</b> <strong>Nora Radcliffe: Sandra Gregory</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament supports the application by Sandra Gregory for a Royal Pardon from the King of
    Thailand on which a decision is expected shortly; notes that she was a first time offender
    and seriously ill when committing the crime which led to her arrest in Thailand;
    acknowledges that she is serving a disproportionately high sentence compared to that which
    she would have received from a British judge; notes that an application for a Royal Pardon
    is an integral part of the Thai judicial system; fears that the current refusal by Her
    Majesty&#146;s Government to support her application may be interpreted by the Thai
    authorities as a lack of support; notes the groundswell of public and political support
    for her immediate release from HMP Cookham Wood; is concerned that it will be a further
    two years before she can re-apply for a Royal Pardon, and calls upon the Foreign and
    Commonwealth Office to support her application to the King of Thailand.</p>
