          <p> <strong>*S1M-2486</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Scottish Transport 
            Group Pension Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament notes that both 
            the Scottish Transport Group Staff Pension Fund and the Scottish Transport 
            Group Transport Operatives Pension Scheme have still to be wound up 
            some eight years after privatisation; further notes that the Scottish 
            Executive promised in December 2000 that a total sum of £100 million 
            would be distributed to the pension scheme members and that this would 
            result in a payment of an average of about £7,000 for each member; 
            recognises that the actual total surplus of the pension funds is considerably 
            in excess of £100 million; believes that the level of payment proposed 
            last December by the Scottish Executive is inadequate and should be 
            increased, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to meet representatives 
            of the Scottish Bus Group Pensioners' Action Committee and to make 
            available to them all relevant information to enable them to assist 
            the pensioners in achieving a just settlement.</p>
