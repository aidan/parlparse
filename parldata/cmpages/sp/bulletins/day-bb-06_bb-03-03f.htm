<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&#117;
  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4058#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Abolition of Tolls on the Forth and Tay Road Bridges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement to begin planning for the much-needed replacement bridge at Queensferry; further welcomes the fact that the request by the Forth Estuary Transport Authority to increase tolls on the existing bridge has been rejected; believes that it is neither fair, equitable nor consistent to leave Fife as the only area in Scotland to be burdened with tolls; considers that this will have a detrimental effect on social justice and the Fife economy, and supports calls to the Scottish Executive to review its decision to maintain tolling on the Forth and Tay bridges.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christine May<strong>*</strong>, Helen Eadie<strong>*</strong>, Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4057&lt;&gt;</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>20th Anniversary of Nuclear Accident at Chernobyl</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 26 April 2006 is the 20th anniversary of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl and that the cross-party International Development Group is holding a meeting on that date to observe the anniversary of the accident, learn lessons from the past and look to the future; reflects upon the terrible social and environmental legacy that this horrific accident left, and continues to leave, in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and beyond; pays respect to the many people whose lives were lost following the explosion; acknowledges with sadness the implications for all those who continue to suffer ill-health caused by radiation poisoning today and the severe difficulties still faced by the communities worst affected; further notes that pollution from the accident affected countries as far away as Scotland, where it continues to leave an environmental legacy; strongly commends Scottish charities and civic organisations for their outstanding work in supporting individuals and affected communities, and recognises the need to take national and international action to avoid any possibility of future environmental catastrophes such as the Chernobyl nuclear accident ever being repeated.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4056</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Abbotsford House - Home of Sir Walter Scott</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the internationally recognised literary talent of Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), author of novels, among others, such as <em>Waverley, Guy Mannering, The Heart of Midlothian</em> and <em>Redgauntlet, </em>and poems, such as the renowned &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;, which in its day sold 25,000 copies in eight months; further recognises the historic significance of his home, Abbotsford House, built by him on the site of Cartleyhole farmhouse and completed in 1824, incorporating eclectic architectural features, such as a gateway from Linlithgow Palace, roof designs from Rosslyn Chapel, a mantelpiece from Melrose Abbey and oak panelling from the Auld Kirk in Dunfermline, and notes that he also landscaped the grounds; expresses concern that the house and its contents, which include such artefacts as Rob Roy&rsquo;s gun, a lock of Bonnie Prince Charlie&rsquo;s hair and Montrose&rsquo;s sword, may be forced to close down in the next few years through lack of funding support, and calls on the Scottish Executive, in light of the house&rsquo;s literary and historic significance and indeed as an asset to the Borders and Scottish tourist industry, to intervene now and work with concerned parties, including the National Trust, to ensure the preservation of both the house itself and the idiosyncratic collections which reflect the personality of this talented and romantic Scot.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4055</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Puerto Rico</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the people of Puerto Rico on forcing the United States of America to remove its ships and planes from Puerto Rican waters in the face of local opposition to a major military exercise which would have resulted in the bombing and shelling of part of their coastline; recognises the benefits of having the powers to take such a decision that come from being an independent country and strongly regrets the fact that, due to the lack of these powers, the waters round the coast of Scotland are now being used for this military exercise; agrees that military exercises should not be dumped on Scotland when other countries assert their right to refuse to have them on their territory, and believes that the US military should use its own territory for bombing and shelling practice.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4054</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Threat to Future of Grampian Television</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the contribution made over the last 45 years by Grampian Television to the regional identity of the north east of Scotland and to the social cohesion of the diverse communities it services; further recognises that Grampian Television has had a consistently high standard of programming output and has been the launch-pad for many successful broadcasting careers; is therefore deeply concerned by the decision by Grampian TV&rsquo;s owner, Scottish Media Group, to drop the name of Grampian Television as part of a &quot;re-branding exercise&quot; and considers that this would represent a loss of broadcasting heritage; believes that this decision will be unpopular with viewers and represents the further erosion of regional broadcasting with the north and north east losing a vital part of their region&rsquo;s cultural identity, and calls for the regulatory authorities to ensure that those remaining elements of regional broadcasting are protected and enhanced.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4053</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Save Borderline Theatre Company!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the excellent work of Borderline Theatre Company over the last 32 years; acknowledges the quality and professionalism of the company and its roots in Ayrshire; further recognises that it has entertained almost a million people across Scotland; expresses its disappointment in the Scottish Arts Council&rsquo;s (SAC) decision to cease its revenue funding which will also mean the loss of Borderline&rsquo;s extensive Lifelong Learning Programme which last year delivered over 1,100 workshops with 18,168 people taking part; condemns the SAC decision, and invites the Scottish Executive to review urgently the current funding situation for Borderline.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4052#</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>New Powers for Credit Unions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the extended facilities available to credit unions from April 2006 which will allow them to offer a wider range of services to their members; notes that these facilities will include insurance products, budgeting and savings accounts and flexible low-cost loans based on ability to pay; recognises the importance of the role played by credit unions in helping to alleviate poverty, prevent debt and its devastating consequences for many low income families, encourage saving and prudent borrowing and support regeneration in many communities across Scotland, such as Glenrothes and Levenmouth in Fife; further welcomes the additional support provided for approved credit unions to establish and administer these services; acknowledges that the credit union movement embodies and promotes the principles of mutualism and co-operation, and believes that the expansion of the credit union network in Scotland will play a vital part in enabling regeneration of many more communities.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4051</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Sportscotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to reach a decision regarding the relocation of the headquarters of the national sport agency, <strong>sport</strong>scotland; believes that the new headquarters should be based in the national sports arena being built in Glasgow; recognises that Glasgow has a well-earned reputation as a city of sport; believes that the relocation would strengthen Scotland&rsquo;s bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games; further believes that the new headquarters could potentially be part of a wider regeneration strategy; notes that this relocation would enable <strong>sport</strong>scotland to maximise its Sport 21 objectives to increase participation and challenge the health statistics of Scotland; further notes that the emphatic report by PMP Consultants, naming Glasgow&rsquo;s east end as the best place for the new <strong>sport</strong>scotland headquarters, should be upheld, and finally believes that creating a &quot;hub of sport&quot; with the national arena, the headquarters and many of sports&rsquo; governing bodies would be of immense benefit in developing Scotland&rsquo;s sporting future.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4050</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Renaming of Prestwick International Airport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the call for Prestwick International Airport to be renamed Robert Burns Airport in memory of our national bard and agrees that this change of name will enhance the continuing development of the Burns Heritage Trail and tourism in the south of Scotland.</p>
