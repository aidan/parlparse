          <p><strong>S1M-2101 Mr Gil Paterson:</strong> James Wilson, John Baird 
            and Andrew Hardie-That the Parliament recognises the sacrifice of 
            the three 1820 martyrs, James Wilson from Strathaven and John Baird 
            and Andrew Hardie from Glasgow, who were hanged and beheaded in the 
            1820 rising which fought for social and economic justice, workers' 
            rights and an independent Scottish parliament and believes that the 
            history of their struggle should be included in the education curriculum 
            in order to mark the anniversaries, on 30 August and 3 September, 
            of their sacrifice for Scottish rights 181 years ago. </p>
