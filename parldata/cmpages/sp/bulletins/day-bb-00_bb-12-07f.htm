            by parents, carers and organisations such as the Strathclyde Autistic

            and to negotiate the transfer of lead responsibility for European

            Scottish Executive in recognition of Scotland's dominant position 
            within the UK industry; questions the basis on which many of the proposals 
            tabled by the EU Commission for the December Fisheries Council were 
            formulated; calls for the urgent implementation of a recovery plan 
            for fish stocks comprising a range of technical measures to achieve 
            the aim of sustainability; further recognises that adequately funded 
            economic and social measures will also be required to ensure the viability 
            of our fishing communities and achieve a restructuring of the fishing 
            fleet; calls for an early introduction of zonal management to ensure 
            that the unacceptable decision-making process that prevents stability 
            in the fishing industry is not repeated, and notes that the Labour-Liberal 
            coalition's policies have left the Scottish fishing industry at a 
            competitive disadvantage.&quot;</a> </font></p>
