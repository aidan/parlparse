          <p><strong>*S2M-511#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Review 
            of Maternity Services in Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the decision of Greater Glasgow Health Board to endorse the recommendations 
            of the maternity working group to close the Queen Mother's Hospital 
            and transfer services to the Southern General Hospital; further notes 
            the concerns of the public and hospital health professionals at the 
            closure of the Queen Mother's Hospital and subsequently services at 
            the Royal Hospital for Sick Children and the adverse effect that this 
            will have on maternity and children's services throughout Scotland, 
            and considers that the Minister for Health and Community Care, Malcolm 
            Chisholm, should launch an immediate investigation into the maternity 
            services review by Greater Glasgow Health Board.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-510</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>Stobswell 
            Pharmacy, Dundee</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Stobswell 
            Pharmacy, Dundee, after its first successful year as a model for community 
            pharmacies; notes the valuable role that pharmacies play in promoting 
            a healthy style of living, and congratulates all those associated 
            with the pharmacy on their work in promoting health in the local community 
            and promoting the name of Dundee through another new project tested 
            in the city to benefit the rest of Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-509#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses' Dispute Still Unresolved</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the persistent refusal by COSLA to conduct meaningful negotiations 
            with UNISON to resolve the nursery nurses' dispute; recognises that 
            recruitment and retention difficulties will be exacerbated without 
            an acceptable solution and that differences in pay grades and career 
            structure across authorities will lead to local authorities competing 
            with each other for staff, undermining continuity of education for 
            children; further recognises the need for an agreed national settlement 
            binding on local authorities that meets the moderate demands of nursery 
            nurses, and considers that the Scottish Executive should intervene, 
            albeit belatedly, to secure settlement of the dispute.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-508</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Charitable 
            Status of Independent Schools in Perth and Kinross</strong>-That the 
            Parliament recognises the economic contribution made by independent 
            schools to Perth and Kinross and the contribution of some 700 jobs 
            and £13 million per annum; further recognises that independent schools 
            currently benefit from charitable status without which many would 
            struggle to continue in existence, and accordingly calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to safeguard the charitable status of independent schools, 
            thus protecting parental choice and safeguarding jobs in Perth and 
            Kinross.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-507#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            White Stuff Milk Moustache Campaign</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the launch of the Scottish White Stuff Milk Moustache campaign, a 
            joint campaign of the Milk Development Council and the Scottish Dairy 
            Marketing Company; supports its aims of promoting increased consumption 
            of low fat, semi-skimmed milk as part of a balanced diet, targeted 
            especially at young people who are known to have, on average, lower 
            intakes of vitamins and minerals; applauds the campaign for tailoring 
            its message to the perceptions and interests of young people such 
            as by emphasising the benefits of milk for skin complexion; praises 
            celebrities who have supported the campaign, and acknowledges the 
            complimentarity between the Scottish White Stuff Milk Moustache campaign 
            and the Scottish Executive's Healthy Living campaign.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-506</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for David Amess MP's Early Day Motion on Asylum Seekers and the Right 
            to Work</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates David Amess, MP 
            for Southend West, who has laid an Early Day Motion (EDM) before the 
            Houses of Parliament regretting Her Majesty's Government's decision 
            to deny the right to work to asylum seekers, the right to apply for 
            permission to work having been withdrawn from asylum seekers on 23 
            July 2002; supports the EDM which states, "That this House regrets 
            the decision in 2002 by the Secretary of State for the Home Department 
            to prevent asylum seekers from working while their applications for 
            residency are under consideration; urges the Home Secretary to reconsider 
            that decision; recognises that issuing temporary work permits would 
            reduce the temptation to work illegally, and believes that allowing 
            asylum seekers to contribute to the British economy would reduce tensions 
            within the local communities where they are located", and calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government 
            to reverse its decision of 23 July 2002 and allow asylum seekers throughout 
            the UK to seek work while waiting for their claims to be considered.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-505</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Statues 
            of Justice and Mercy</strong>-That the Parliament notes the existence 
            of the statues Justice and Mercy, sculpted in 1637 by Alexander Mylne 
            of Perth, that stood above the great door of Parliament Hall within 
            the old Scottish Parliament; further notes that the statues are currently 
            under the care of the Faculty of Advocates and Court of Session in 
            Parliament House; regrets the lack of awareness and knowledge of these 
            statues; believes that prominently displaying them in the new Parliament 
            building at Holyrood would be an ideal way of linking the old Parliament 
            with the new, and calls on the Presiding Officer to investigate, along 
            with the Faculty of Advocates and Court of Session, the possibility 
            of installing these historical artefacts in a suitably cherished position 
            within the new parliament building.</P>

            Mod; appreciates that the Gaelic language is an integral part of life
