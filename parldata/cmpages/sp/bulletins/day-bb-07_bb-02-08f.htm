<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5563&diams; </strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson:</strong> <strong>ME Charities&rsquo; Response to DWP Guidance on ME/CFS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the statement by all the national ME representative organisations in response to version 9 of the Department of Work and Pensions&rsquo; (DWP) guidance document on ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS); further notes the unanimity of the condemnation contained within the response and the disappointment that, following extensive consultation, the DWP has made only minor changes in version 9 of the guidance, despite many of the proposals contained in the draft guidance being unanimously rejected in July 2006 by all the ME organisations involved; further notes that the DWP fails to recognise that ME/CFS is classified by the World Heath Organisation as a neurological disease, and is accepted as such by the Department of Health; finally notes that the guidelines grossly understate the seriousness, chronicity and progressive nature of this organic condition, especially for the severely affected who make up 25% of the ME/CFS population, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its influence to persuade the DWP to revise its final guidelines to ensure that ME/CFS sufferers receive the correct allocation of benefits to which they are entitled and that the views of sufferers&rsquo; representatives in Dumfries and Galloway and across Scotland are fully addressed within those guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5562</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Widespread Support for Airgun Ban</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the result of a recent System Three opinion poll indicated that 82% of Scottish citizens would support a ban on airguns and that only 8% are opposed to such a ban; further notes that the support for such a ban is highest, at 85%, among both the oldest and youngest sections of Scots; believes that this widespread support for an airgun ban should result in support for the member&rsquo;s bill proposal to ban air guns in the name of Tommy Sheridan or in the Scottish Executive agreeing to take over the proposal and deliver such a ban, and also notes the recent comments of senior sheriff, Richard Davidson, who said in Dundee Sheriff Court in relation to a woman found guilty of misusing an airgun, &quot;It is simply intolerable for anyone to be walking around the streets of this city, or indeed any city, with such a dangerous weapon and to be prepared to use it in the manner in which she did. What I don&rsquo;t understand is what our legislators are thinking about in permitting such an item to be available over the counter without requiring a firearms certificate&quot;.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5561</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Transport and Works (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Transport and Works (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
<p>Groups 1 to 5: 1 hour 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5560</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Draft Mental Health (Safety and Security) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the draft Mental Health (Safety and Security) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2007 be approved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5558</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with Cuba against the Hilton Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent decision of the Hilton hotel group to refuse a booking from a Cuban delegation in Oslo and condemns this as an act of blatant political victimisation driven by the United States of America which continues to impose an illegal trade embargo on the Cuban socialist republic and calls on the Parliament&rsquo;s travel desk and the Scottish Executive to cancel existing bookings and refuse to engage in any further trade with the Hilton group anywhere in the world until it apologises to Cuba for insulting its people and publicly announces that there will be no more discrimination against Cuba at the behest of America or for any other reason.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5549.1</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> <strong>Early Years Education, Development and Care</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5549) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;that there needs&quot; to end and insert &quot;can assist parents with the difficult but rewarding task of raising children; further believes that provision must be advanced, highly-skilled and flexible in order to meet the range of needs that parents and children in Scotland have; therefore expresses its concern that access to qualified teachers in nurseries may be insufficient in some areas of Scotland; recognises the potential that early intervention has for helping children from disadvantaged backgrounds, or who have additional support needs or are otherwise at risk, and calls for serious consideration to be given to expanding the number of family centres, particularly in areas of deprivation.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5549.2</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Early Years Education, Development and Care</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5549) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;that there needs&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the significant increase in pre-school education entitlement that has been delivered since 1999; recognises that teachers have, and will continue to have, a major role to play in delivering pre-school education; recognises the vital role that qualified early years practitioners play in delivering early years services and welcomes proposals to deliver greater professionalism and improved career pathways for early years staff; welcomes proposals under A Curriculum for Excellence to introduce more active learning into early primary education; recognises that early years strategy needs to reflect these developments, and recognises that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s investment in education has rebuilt the foundations of a successful education system in Scotland&quot;.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5535.1</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Forth and Tay Road Bridges Tolls</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5535) in the name of Tricia Marwick, leave out from &quot;the tolls&quot; to end and insert &quot;existing tolls on the Forth Road Bridge and the Tay Road Bridge should be replaced with a scheme of variable charging which takes into account factors such as occupancy levels, peak hour traffic flows and specific exemptions, including for public transport, and that the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board and the Forth Transport Estuary Forum should be given more flexibility to use toll revenues to deal with transport issues in the vicinity.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5535.2</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Forth and Tay Road Bridges Tolls</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5535) in the name of Tricia Marwick, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;commits to a replacement crossing across the Forth and calls on the Cabinet to commit to preparatory work to start immediately; calls for the case for abolition of the tolls on the Fife Bridges to be considered in the light of the commitment to the new crossing; notes that the SNP&rsquo;s sums do not add up and that under its current plans the SNP would not be able to afford to lift the tolls and pay for the construction of a new crossing; notes that its proposals do not address the impact of congestion or other environmental, social and economic impacts, and notes the importance of a sustainable transport policy, including smart tolling and investment in public transport to meet the long-term needs of Scotland.&quot;</p>
