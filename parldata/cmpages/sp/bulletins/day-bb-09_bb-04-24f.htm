<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3972</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Yeadon&rsquo;s of Elgin, Scotland&rsquo;s Independent Book Shop of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff and management of Yeadon&rsquo;s of Elgin bookshop on its being named the Scottish Independent Bookshop of the Year 2009; further congratulates all involved for its earning a place in the final shortlist of five for this year&rsquo;s British Book Industry Independent Bookshop of the Year award; notes that Yeadon&rsquo;s of Elgin is one of Scotland&rsquo;s oldest continuously trading bookshops and that it will begin publishing its own titles again this year, reviving a tradition that ran between the 1880s and 1940s, and finally wishes Yeadon&rsquo;s of Elgin the best of luck in securing its place as Britain&rsquo;s best independent bookshop at The Nibbies in Cambridge on 1 June.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3971</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Remember the Dead, Fight for the Living</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day on 28 April 2009, which has the theme, good occupational health for all workers; notes that International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day commemorates the two million workers who die from accidents and diseases at work, the 1.2 million who are injured and the 160 million who fall ill each year due to unsafe, unhealthy or unsustainable work and workplaces; notes that such deaths greatly exceed the number of deaths caused by war and that many such deaths are preventable by improved health and safety; calls for this day to be widely observed in Scotland through action to improve safety and provide a healthier working environment, and believes that the Scottish Government and others should formally recognise International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day as an annual event when they take stock and advance plans for health and safety improvements and seek to provide a healthier working environment in the year to come.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3970</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Major Benson-Blair</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament gives its support to Major Angus Benson-Blair of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards for his noble challenge to cycle 3,100 miles across America in under 12 days to raise $35,000 for the Army Benevolent Fund and the British Army Benevolent Fund America; notes that Major Benson-Blair, who has served twice in Iraq, will begin his endeavour on 17 June 2009 in California on the west coast and will finish at Maryland on the east coast; understands that to complete this gruelling task Major Benson-Blair will cycle 260 miles per day and that during his trans-continental charge he will gain over 100,000 vertical feet, the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest over three times; hopes that many individuals and organisations in Scotland, the rest of the United Kingdom and in the United States of America will show their support to Major Benson-Blair by visiting www.benson-blair.com, and commends him on his courageous quest to raise funding for these important charities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3969&diams; </strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Partick Thistle Community Engagement Programme, Preparing for Glasgow 2014</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the Partick Thistle Football Club community engagement programme and recognises the value that this service provides to vulnerable and socially excluded groups in Glasgow; believes that football clubs have enormous potential for bringing together third sector organisations for the purposes of improving the nation&rsquo;s health and wellbeing and that, while health improvements can be inspired through the popular medium of football, individual clubs can also secure their long-term sustainability by increasing community participation; notes that community engagement and enhancing partnerships are two of the five core principles of the Scottish Government 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy plan, and considers that Partick Thistle&rsquo;s programme is a fine example of good practice in this area that supports efforts to steer the nation towards healthier living ahead of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3968</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Beltane Fire Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes this year&rsquo;s Beltane Fire Festival; notes that the start of the summer celebrations will take place during the night of Thursday 30 April 2009; further notes that this unique wild procession of fire, drumming and revelry on Edinburgh&rsquo;s Carlton Hill is a revival of the ancient Celtic fertility festival, and highlights the cultural influence that the Beltane Fire Society has on Edinburgh, with an estimated 12,000 people expected to attend.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3967</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>New Europe Film Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the New Europe Film Festival, at the Edinburgh Filmhouse between 16 and 27 April 2009, for bringing films from the 12 new Member States of the European Union to Scotland with a view to increasing intercultural dialogue between Scottish citizens and the thousands of eastern Europeans who have immigrated to Scotland since the 2004 EU enlargement and to increase awareness, knowledge and understanding about the culture and way of life of the eastern European nations and peoples featured in the festival.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3966</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>St Kilda</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes plans to examine the feasibility of a new St Kilda visitor centre by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar; recognises the social and cultural significance of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s only dual UNESCO world heritage site, which was permanently evacuated in August 1930, for future generations; further recognises that this comes following the inspiration of St Kilda &ndash; A European Opera, which was performed in 2007 simultaneously in the Western Isles, France, Belgium, Germany and Austria and which celebrated the history of the island and the hardship faced by the community; also notes moves to include St Kilda in the proposed Harris National Park due to the shared history of the people of St Kilda and Harris, and believes that St Kilda has a large part to play in the future economic wellbeing of the Western Isles.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3965</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Re-establishment of Access to Play in Planning Policies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Alliance for Childhood on the occasion of its first conference held at the Scottish Parliament on 23 April 2009; notes the terms of Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; expresses its concern that, although Scottish Planning Policy 11 established the principle that access to play should be embedded in planning policies, this principle has been extracted from the new planning policy document, and calls on the Scottish Government to re-establish this principle and reaffirm its commitment to incorporating the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in full in all appropriate public policy areas.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3933 *#*</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Private Residential Care Home Accountability</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vital support for vulnerable elderly people provided through well managed care homes in Scotland; notes the increase in the number of privately managed and financed residential care homes in the Scottish Borders and further notes the role of the Care Commission in ensuring that all care homes in the public and private sector are delivering a high standard of care; also notes that financial mismanagement of private sector homes operations has caused worrying disruption in care but considers that there are very limited statutory powers for the Care Commission and local authorities to scrutinise the financial capability and security of private care homes operations, and believes that it would be beneficial for there to be more regular financial accountability as there is for the standard of care.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Iain Smith<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-3557</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Keep the Post Public</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Royal Mail Group third-quarter results show revenue of &pound;2.6 billion, up from &pound;2.5 billion last year, with all four businesses in profit, year-to-date profit of &pound;255 million compared to &pound;162 million for the whole of 2007-08 and full-year profits expected nearly to double; considers that profits would be higher were it not for the uncompetitive conditions under which the Royal Mail delivers mail for rival companies; notes opposition from businesses and the public towards privatisation, with opinion polls showing public support for privatisation as low as 3%; notes the importance of the universal service obligation to the social and economic wellbeing of Scotland; endorses the call for a new relationship between management and postal unions and welcomes the commitment of the Communication Workers Union to negotiate an agreement that would support the modernisation of the industry; observes that in 2007 the UK Government agreed to a &pound;1.2 billion loan facility on commercial terms to modernise Royal Mail operations but that two years later only half of this money has been spent; welcomes the recommendations in the Hooper Report that the UK Government should take responsibility for the pensions deficit that followed an extended contributions holiday; recognises that the global financial situation has exacerbated the pension fund problems, but believes that, if these can be addressed to facilitate partial privatisation, then they can be addressed to facilitate keeping the otherwise profitable Royal Mail publicly owned, and further believes that the best way to protect the universal service obligation, including six days a week delivery, is to keep the post public.</p>
