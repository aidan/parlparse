          <p><strong>*S1M-2503</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Scottish Public 
            Sector Ombudsman Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&#151;That the Parliament, 
            for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from 
            the Scottish Public Sector Ombudsman Bill, agrees to any increase 
            in expenditure payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence 
            of the Act.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2502</strong> <strong>Fiona McLeod: Munlochy GM Protest 
            Site</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the Ross and Cromarty 
            Planning Committee of Highland Council on its recent decision to grant 
            planning permission for the Munlochy GM protest site; recognises that 
            the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the 
            environment threatens Scotland&#146;s reputation as a producer of 
            quality food, and applauds the protesters for their peaceful vigil 
            which has ensured that this issue remains the focus of public attention.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2501#</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Criminal Proceedings 
            in Sexual Assault Cases</strong>&#151;That the Parliament considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should investigate the fall in the number of 
            cases of sexual assault and lewd and indecent behaviour which have 
            proceeded to court in the last 10 years; believes that, in the light 
            of the falling conviction rate for rape cases, an urgent review of 
            the procedures used by the police and procurator fiscal&#146;s office 
            in cases of sexual assault is needed, and considers that the Executive 
            should ensure that the Crown Office carries out proper tracking of 
            all cases to make sure that certain crimes are not being proceeded 
            against or having fiscal fines imposed more frequently than others 
            and that proper action is taken in all cases.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2500</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: Community Care 
            and Health (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That the Health and Community 
            Care Committee considers the Community Care and Health (Scotland) 
            Bill at Stage 2 in the following order: sections 8 and 9, sections 
            10 to 14, sections 15 to 18, sections 1 to 7, sections 19 to 22, the 
            schedule, sections 23 and 24.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2498</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Overcrowding of 
            Trains</strong>&#151;That the Parliament regrets the lamentable failure 
            of ScotRail to deal with overcrowding of trains; believes that it 
            is a matter of serious concern in respect of not only passenger comfort 
            but also passenger safety; is of the view that passengers should be 
            guaranteed seats when purchasing their rail tickets, and calls upon 
            ScotRail to address this issue in the interests of their long suffering 
            customers and passengers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2497#</strong> <strong>John Scott: A Task Force for 
            Ayrshire</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the deteriorating 
            employment situation in Ayrshire, particularly in the Prestwick area, 
            where the downturn in the aviation sector is resulting in significant 
            job losses and considers that the Scottish Executive, in conjunction 
            with Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire and the local authorities, should 
            establish a Task Force to address this problem as a matter of urgency. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2496#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: Lanarkshire Voluntary 
            Housing Forum</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates housing associations 
            in Lanarkshire on the creation of the Lanarkshire Voluntary Housing 
            Forum which was launched on 26 November 2001; notes the positive involvement 
            of both South and North Lanarkshire Councils, and expresses particular 
            thanks to the Forum's voluntary committee members who work tirelessly 
            to ensure that their housing associations provide decent affordable 
            housing to those who choose or require to rent.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2495 Withdrawn</strong></p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2485#</strong> <strong>Mike Watson: Cross-Party Support 
            for a Review of Construction Industry in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament <a name="MotionText">recognises the importance of the construction 
            industry to the Scottish economy and the contribution it makes to 
            supporting employment and vocational education and training; notes 
            that nine out of every 10 construction firms employ less than eight 
            people; acknowledges that the reputation of the whole industry is 
            damaged by the actions of rogue traders, particularly within the residential 
            sector and that small businesses contend that their profitability 
            and competitiveness is adversely affected by the system of cash retentions, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should initiate a strategic 
            review of construction in Scotland in order to (a) identify how best 
            to combat the &quot;cowboy&quot; element, (b) support the education 
            and training infrastructure so that it is able to meet the skill requirements 
            of the industry, (c) examine the possibility of developing an inspection 
            and assessment regime to evaluate the competence of construction companies, 
            (d) address the system of cash retentions and (e) ensure that the 
            provisions within the existing construction contracts legislation 
            deliver a process that is fair, effective and easy to understand.

          <p><strong>S1M-2470.1</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson: Birthplace 
            of John Muir in Dunbar</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-2470) 
            in the name of Michael Russell, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out 
            from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the initiative 
            taken by the John Muir Birthplace Trust to develop the John Muir Birthplace 
            in Dunbar High Street as a fitting tribute to the creator of America&#146;s 
            national parks and the father of modern environmentalism and as a 
            centre to promote understanding of our natural environment; acknowledges 
            the widespread support for this proposal in Dunbar and elsewhere following 
            consultation on the planning application to East Lothian Council; 
            notes the conclusion of the conservation architect Nicholas Groves-Raines 
            that the building had been gutted in the 1970s with the result that 
            none of the original interior features remain to be conserved; is 
            confident that the sensitive redevelopment of the John Muir Birthplace 
            will attract substantially more visitors than the 2,028, of whom only 
            3% were Americans, who visited the centre this year; endorses the 
            decision of the Scottish Executive to grant consent for the necessary 
            alterations to this important listed building, and welcomes the support 
            of the Heritage Lottery Fund for this excellent initiative.&quot;</a>
