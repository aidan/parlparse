<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7460 Dr Richard Simpson: Scotland&rsquo;s Rugby World Ranking</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes what it considers to be the significant victory by Scotland&rsquo;s rugby team over the world champions, South Africa, and congratulates Andy Robinson and the entire squad for achieving Scotland&rsquo;s highest-ever world ranking of sixth.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7459 Aileen Campbell: Congratulations to Incoming and Outgoing Chairs of Lesmahagow Community Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Jane Armstrong from Lesmahagow on her election as chair of Lesmahagow Community Council and sends its best wishes to outgoing chair, Jim Macintyre; recognises the many years of service that Jim has given to the council and the many different achievements of Lesmahagow Community Council under his chairmanship, including what it considers several successful Doors Open Days in the town and campaigns on a range of matters, including the proposed closure of the town&rsquo;s Jubilee Hall; also recognises the commitment of Jane Armstrong to the town, including her role in the Lesmahagow Old Parish Young Women&rsquo;s Group, and wishes Jane and the community council every success in the years to come.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Hume<strong>*</strong>, Bob Doris<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7458 Brian Adam: UK Government to Remove Emergency Towing Vessels</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with anger the decision of the UK Government to remove the four emergency towing vessels (ETV) stationed around the UK from September 2011; believes that the ETVs play a key role in allowing a rapid response to emergency situations at sea, including fire fighting, rescue of personnel, pollution response and salvage; notes the importance of the country&rsquo;s coastal water to local economies through fishing, aquaculture and tourism; further notes Lord Donaldson&rsquo;s report, <em>Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas</em>,<em> </em>which recommended the introduction of the vessels after the Braer tanker disaster in 1993 during which nearly 85,000 tonnes of crude oil were spilled off the Shetland Islands, and calls on the UK Government to conduct a full assessment of the effects of the cuts on maritime safety and the capacity of the UK to respond to a Deepwater Horizon type event in, or another oil spill around, UK coastal waters.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7457 Kenneth Gibson: Tax Avoidance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled by what it considers to be the UK Government&rsquo;s casual attitude towards tax avoidance by some of Britain&rsquo;s richest companies; believes that the acceptance of such behaviour renders the Prime Minister&rsquo;s claim that we&rsquo;re all in this together in terms of the recession, redundant; agrees that closing obvious tax loopholes and ensuring that the correct amount of taxation is paid by companies would be a more effective way of reducing the budget deficit than by simply slashing public spending; finds incredible reports that HM Revenue and Customs allowed Vodafone to forgo &pound;4.8 billion of tax; is aware that, days after this case was settled, Chancellor George Osborne travelled to India to promote Vodafone; is shocked by suggestions that UK companies annually avoid at least &pound;12 billion in tax, and believes that HM Treasury should act with urgency to close such loopholes.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7452 Malcolm Chisholm: Lothian Supported Carers Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland on the launch of the Lothian Supported Carers Scheme (LSCS), a new Lothian-wide project based in north Edinburgh and funded for five years by the Big Lottery Fund in partnership with all of Lothian&rsquo;s local authorities; understands that young people often leave care with multiple and complex needs and are vulnerable to the risk of homelessness and social exclusion; recognises that the scheme will provide what it believes will be much-needed accommodation and support for 65 young care leavers not ready to live independently; considers that LSCS will play a vital role in working with young care leavers and providing a positive role model from which to develop meaningful relationships and reduce the risk of antisocial or offending behaviour; commends the engagement of young people in the scheme; applauds the contribution that carers will make in helping young people through the important transition from adolescence to adulthood, and looks forward to seeing the young people realise their full potential.</p>
