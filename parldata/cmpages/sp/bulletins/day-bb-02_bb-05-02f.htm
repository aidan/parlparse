          <p><strong>*S1M-3064# Alex Johnstone: Belgian Plato Pilot Programme</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the introduction of the Belgian Plato pilot 
            programme for 14 small businesses in Dundee and surrounding areas, 
            providing a business-to-business support structure for small- and 
            medium-sized enterprises and partnering them with parent companies 
            NCR and Michelin to develop a network of support and advice.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="3063"></a>*S1M-3063</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: 
            Social Justice Committee - Inquiry into the Voluntary Sector</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the Social Justice Committee&#146;s <em>1st Report 
            2002: Report on Inquiry into the Voluntary Sector</em> (SP Paper 531).</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3062#</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Glasgow Airport 
            Rail Link</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the importance of 
            Glasgow Airport to the economy of west central Scotland, growing congestion 
            on the M8, M74 and M77, the economic and employment opportunities 
            that would be opened up by establishing a rail link to Glasgow Airport 
            and the urgent need to enhance public transport facilities serving 
            the airport; is concerned at the lack of progress on agreeing and 
            proceeding with this key project, and believes that the Minister for 
            Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning should convene an urgent 
            meeting of Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority, British Airports 
            Authority, Railtrack, Glasgow City Council, Renfrewshire Council, 
            Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and other interested parties in order 
            to agree a timetabled action plan for delivery of the Glasgow Airport 
            rail link at the earliest possible date.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3061#</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: ME and Loss 
            of Education</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes ME Awareness 
            Week, beginning on 12 May 2002; commends research conducted in England 
            by Dr Betty Dowsett and Jane Colby which suggests that more than 50% 
            of pupils&#146; long-term school sickness absence results from ME; 
            recognises that a considerable percentage of such pupils miss many 
            years of education and social development, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should take the necessary steps to identify the extent of 
            the problem in Scotland and to address actively the problem of ensuring 
            that young Scots who lose out on education and social development 
            as a result of ME are not handicapped for life by such loss.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3060#</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: National 
            Strategy for Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the work of the Cross-Party group on survivors 
            of childhood sexual abuse on co-ordinating and developing an outline 
            national strategy for children and adults who have experienced sexual 
            abuse during childhood and, in the light of recommendations made by 
            the recent independent inquiry commissioned by Fife Council following 
            the conviction of David Logan Murphy, believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should actively develop a national strategy, based on the work of 
            the cross-party group, that considers the wide social, health, mental 
            and legal implications of sexual abuse and its impact on survivors 
            and society as a whole.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3059#</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie: Economic 
            Regeneration of Braehead</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            economic regeneration emanating from Braehead in the west of Scotland; 
            welcomes the creation of new jobs there, and further notes the related 
            opportunity for the positive development of the maritime potential 
            of the Clyde.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3058#</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: International 
            Plan of Action on Ageing 2002</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            the adoption of the International Plan of Action on Ageing 2002 and 
            the Political Declaration by UN member states following the Second 
            World Assembly on Ageing held in Madrid from 8 to 12 April 2002; further 
            notes that the world community recognises that we live in a world 
            of ageing populations and rising life expectancy and that signatory 
            states are obliged to review their policies on access to social services 
            and healthcare in order to promote independence and the right of everyone 
            to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical and 
            mental health, to enhance the recognition of the dignity of older 
            persons, and to eliminate all forms of unfair discrimination, neglect, 
            abuse and violence against older people; is aware of the progress 
            already being made on delivering free personal care and meeting the 
            needs and concerns of our older citizens in Scotland, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should set out its proposals, working 
            together with Her Majesty's Government, on implementing, so far as 
            they relate to older people in Scotland, the recommendations in the 
            International Action Plan including empowering older people to seek 
            and develop opportunities for service to their communities and to 
            serve as volunteers in positions appropriate to their interests and 
            capabilities.</p>

            Drug Misuse in North East Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            <a name="MotionText">notes with concern that drug misuse in the north 
            east of Scotland has increased dramatically in recent years, with 
            an estimated 50% rise in problem drug users in Grampian alone between 
            1997 and 2000; further notes that Dundee has the second highest and 
            Aberdeen the third highest level of drug misuse in Scotland and that 
            Grampian has the highest percentage of injecting drug users in Scotland, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should recognise the scale 
            of the problem and investigate the level and nature of resources that 
            have been applied to addressing this growing social problem in the 
            north east region, paying particular attention to (a) the role and 
            accountability of the various agencies involved, (b) the amount of 
            resources dedicated to drug users, (c) the cost to society in terms 
            of loss of life, associated health problems and distress caused to 
            users' families and (d) the enormous amount of drug-related crime 
            inflicted on the local community, reflected by the fact that 80% of 
            inmates at HM Prison Aberdeen test positive for drug use at reception</a>.</p>
