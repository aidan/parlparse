    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-1008</b> <strong>Phil Gallie: Crime and Punishment</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes that public confidence in the criminal justice system is at an all time
    low due to the Scottish Executive&#146;s failure to take effective steps to curb rising
    crime; recognises the frustration and anxiety felt by the victims of crime and the wider
    Scottish public arising from early prisoner release and asks the Scottish Executive to
    restore honesty in sentencing by ending automatic remission; further notes with concern
    the proposals to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 8 to 12 and to bring 16 and
    17 year old offenders within the Children&#146;s Hearings System; calls upon the Executive
    to reject the proposals, and demands that the Executive brings forward its proposals to
    strengthen the law in relation to the seizure and confiscation of assets suspected of
    being derived from drug dealing.</p>

    and welcomes the additional resources allocated to local authorities and other bodies in
    order to make further progress with these objectives.</p>
