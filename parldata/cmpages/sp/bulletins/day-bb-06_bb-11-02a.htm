<p><strong>S2M-5055</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>The Financial Powers of the Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the need for an open, inclusive and objective debate about the financial powers that it requires to have in order to maximise accountability, efficient government, economic growth, public services, infrastructure development and good social outcomes in Scotland and further encourages the business community, the trade unions, the public sector, the voluntary sector, academia and wider civic Scotland to participate in this debate, the objective of which must be to make Scotland a more prosperous country, able to deliver social justice to its people. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-5055.3</strong> <strong>Richard Baker: The Financial Powers of the Parliament</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5055) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the arguments for further fiscal autonomy are being used as a cover for the debate on independence; calls on those MSPs who support a separate Scotland to give an honest explanation of what a separate Scotland would mean for our economy, and further believes that we should continue to use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to deliver better health, education, lower crime and economic growth.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5055.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee: The Financial Powers of the Parliament</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5055) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;powers&quot; to end and insert &quot;and non-financial powers that it requires to have in order to maximise accountability, efficient government, economic growth, public services, infrastructure development and good social outcomes in Scotland and further encourages the business community, the trade unions, the public sector, the voluntary sector, academia and wider civic Scotland to participate in this debate, the objective of which must be to make Scotland a more prosperous country, able to deliver social justice to its people, and notes that a more effective and accountable devolved Scottish Parliament would strengthen the United Kingdom.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-5055.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: The Financial Powers of the Parliament</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5055) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Parliament needs significant new powers that follow federal principles; calls for a significant increase in the taxation powers of the Parliament in order to improve competitiveness and accountability, increase transparency, encourage more efficient allocation of resources and allow the Parliament to have greater fiscal levers to influence the direction of the Scottish economy; notes that full fiscal autonomy does not exist in any developed economy in the world and rejects the argument for such autonomy as a cloak for independence which would damage Scotland and our economy; calls for the establishment of a second constitutional convention during the next session of the Parliament to improve the home rule settlement in order to deliver real benefits to the people of Scotland; calls on all political parties and civic Scotland to participate in the new convention; believes that the new convention should also consider the case for additional legislative powers for Scotland and new procedures to improve joint working between the Scottish and UK Parliaments, and calls for the new legislative and fiscal powers of the Scottish Parliament to be enshrined in a written constitution for the United Kingdom.&quot; </p>
