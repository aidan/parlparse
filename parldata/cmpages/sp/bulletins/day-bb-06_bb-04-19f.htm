<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4255</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Civil Justice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that an effective and efficient civil justice system is a crucial part of the foundations of a peaceful and prosperous society and welcomes the commitment to undertake a programme of work to modernise civil law.</p>
<p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4254</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Rule 2.7.2</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees under Rule 2.7.2 that the Parliament shall meet in Committee Rooms 2 and 6 of the Parliament at Holyrood as recommended by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body until 12 May 2006.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4253</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Local Government Pensions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s announcement on 17 January 2006 to abolish the Rule of 85 for members of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) in Scotland; recognises that the proposed changes will have a detrimental impact on many working people who support vital public services, often on low wages, in a wide range of occupations in Scotland, including workers in local government, the Environment Agency, police support, cleaning and waste companies, the voluntary sector, bus companies, higher education and others; notes that this decision means that LGPS members are denied the same rights and protections as members of other public sector pension schemes which have agreed to allow retirement at the age of 60 on a full pension; further notes recent comments made by EU Commissioners on this issue indicating that changes to the Rule of 85 would not necessarily be a requirement under EU legislation and previous assurances given to COSLA and the relevant trade unions that the Rule of 85 for members of the LGPS in Scotland would be retained; recognises that members of the LGPS contribute to the scheme and want to ensure that there is a viable and sustainable future for it; further recognises that the financial standing of Scotland&rsquo;s LGPS is significantly healthier than schemes elsewhere in the UK and therefore calls for a distinctive approach, and further calls on the Executive to review and publish its legal advice regarding the Rule of 85 and to work with trade unions and COSLA to find a settlement which protects local government workers&rsquo; pension rights.</p>
<p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4252</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Statutory Right to Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing social and human cost of drug misuse across Scotland and that past and current policy approaches have failed communities, drug users and their families miserably; regrets the fact that drug-related crime, premature death and family breakdowns continue to rise; believes that the predominant criminal justice-oriented approach to drug-misuse problems in Scotland is not only failing to address the problems but is actually counter-productive in diverting resources and attention away from treatment and rehabilitation; further believes that a predominantly social and health-led approach is now necessary and that a statutory right to a holistic treatment and care plan should be established within a seven-day period of seeking help and should include residential care where required; considers that the introduction of such a statutory right would not only lead to improved care for users and their families, but result in significant crime reduction within communities and subsequent net savings to the public purse; further considers that cannabis use in Scotland should be decriminalised but not encouraged, that debate on the legal status of other drugs must be promoted and that substitute prescription programmes, such as the provision of heroin or buprenorphine for treatment of appropriate users, should be introduced and supported across Scotland, and believes that significant investment in community and sporting facilities to tackle poverty and offer positive recreational activities to Scotland&rsquo;s young people is an essential but under-invested element of anti-drug abuse strategy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4247</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Removal of the Hazizi Family Flies in the Face of the Fresh Talent Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the continued treatment, considered by many to be barbaric, of asylum seekers by the Home Office; is concerned for the well-being and safety of the Hazizi family who were &quot;dawn raided&quot; this morning at their home at the Red Road flats in Glasgow; is concerned for David Hazizi, aged 14, who had hoped to return to school today after the Easter break but is now extremely traumatised and is destined for detention and removal along with his sister Marita, aged 20, who has been studying mathematics and science at the University of Strathclyde but who has now been grabbed away from the final year of her degree and her hopes of becoming a maths teacher here in Scotland, and their brother Gani, aged 19, who has been taken from his partner Lisa and from his unborn child who is due in six weeks time; regrets that the Hazizi family, who have lived in the UK since May 2001, now find themselves in danger and fear, and demands that the First Minister, along with Paul Martin, MSP for the Springburn constituency, and Malcolm Chisholm, Minister for Communities, intervene immediately in the interest of attracting and holding &quot;Fresh Talent&quot; here in Scotland, keeping Gani with his partner and their child and allowing Marita to complete her studies and work here in Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4246</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Stress on Asylum Seekers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the continued stress that asylum seekers find themselves under due to their treatment at the hands of the Home Office; commends all who work with asylum seekers in an effort to alleviate their pain and distress; is concerned that an asylum seeker attempted to take his own life at the Home Office building in Brand Street, Glasgow on 18 April 2006 by cutting his throat with a shard of glass, and invites all members of the Scottish Parliament to show compassion towards Scotland&rsquo;s new citizens for the good of those who come here and for the economic and demographic security of Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4245</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Lorry Drivers, Politicians and Sleep Apnoea</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the exhibition in the Garden Lobby from 18 to 20 April 2006 on sleep disorders; notes that in such conditions the upper airway collapses intermittently and repeatedly during sleep, preventing breathing; notes that there are estimated to be 50,000 adults in Scotland who have this condition, affecting around 1 to 2% of middle-aged men, which is a similar prevalence to Type 1 diabetes; notes that being overweight and in a sedentary occupation increases the likelihood of suffering from this disorder which includes occupations such as lorry and train drivers and, indeed, politicians; further notes that only some 5,000 people receive treatment and that the person suffering from Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is often the last to be aware of the problem; notes that this condition can be successfully managed with a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine which is recommended as the first line of treatment by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network; notes that research at the Edinburgh Sleep Centre concluded that treating 500 patients with CPAP machines for five years would cost &pound;400,000 whereas the estimated cost of accidents caused by 500 untreated sleep apnoea patients over the same period could be &pound;5.3 million; notes that the waiting time for treatment at the Edinburgh Sleep Centre has, however, now risen to 23 months, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to fund sleep centres adequately and to promote awareness of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea.</p>
<p>Supported by: Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4244</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>National Depression Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that 17 to 23 April 2006 is National Depression Week and supports the work by the Depression Alliance Scotland in raising awareness about depression; realises that depression is a common illness affecting one in five people in Scotland; notes that estimates suggest that as many as 75% of people with depression do not seek help from their doctor because they see it as a weakness and not a treatable illness, and hopes that National Depression Week will help to overcome the stigma that those who suffer from depression in Scotland still face.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4243</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Designation of Lead Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Health Committee be designated as the lead committee in consideration of the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4242</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Designation of Lead Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Justice 2 Committee be designated as the lead committee in consideration of the Christmas Day and New Year&rsquo;s Day Trading (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4241</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Just Pull Yourself Together?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the work of Depression Alliance Scotland in providing information and support for anyone affected by depression and anyone caring for someone affected by depression; supports its campaign in raising awareness and understanding of depression, an illness which affected around 300,000 people in Scotland in the last recorded year, half of whom attempt to struggle on without seeking help; recognises that it is an illness and is not simply a case of &quot;pulling oneself together&quot; but that in the majority of cases is treatable, and fully supports its &quot;Mother Father Son Daughter Brother Sister Lover Friend You&quot; campaign raising awareness that depression affects us all either through personal experience or by knowing someone who suffers from depression and that depression is not something to be afraid to admit to or be ashamed of.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4240.1</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>The Queen&rsquo;s 80th Birthday</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4240) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, insert at end &quot;; notes that even her government does not yet want people to work until they are 80; believes that this may be an opportunity for the Queen to consider retirement and to make room for Scotland to become a modern democratic republic, and further notes that her retirement should be made easier by the fact that she will not suffer the same pension shortfall as that faced by millions of ordinary workers.&quot;</p>
