          <p><strong>*S2M-661</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Physical 
            Activity: The Need for Improvement and the Cost of Failure</strong>-That 
            the Parliament acknowledges the significance of the Scottish Executive's 
            physical activity strategy <em>Let's Make Scotland More Active </em>as 
            the approach to tackling the serious, nationwide problem of inactivity; 
            acknowledges the need for urgency and the action taken thus far to 
            tackle inactivity in Scotland as part of the Executive's wide-reaching 
            programme to improve health in Scotland; welcomes the Executive's 
            plans to emphasise walking as the means of increasing levels of physical 
            activity in Scotland, and supports the Executive's intentions to secure 
            national leadership for physical activity in Scotland.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-660</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Violence 
            Against Women</strong>-That the Parliament approves the continuing 
            progress made in implementing the National Strategy to Address Domestic 
            Abuse in Scotland by raising awareness of the issue and increasing 
            the protection of women and children experiencing domestic abuse and 
            the services available to them and welcomes the work of the National 
            Group to Address Violence Against Women in tackling this unacceptable 
            behaviour.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-658#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Impact 
            of Globalisation on Jobs in the Scottish Finance Sector</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is concerned that Lloyds TSB/Scottish Widows is considering 
            plans to transfer some of its operations to India, with the potential 
            loss of many hundreds of Edinburgh-based jobs; notes that moves to 
            replace Scottish workers with significantly lower-paid labour abroad 
            could put pressure on other finance companies to follow suit, with 
            serious consequences for jobs and the economy, and believes that the 
            Scottish Executive should seek a commitment from Lloyds TSB/Scottish 
            Widows that it will cease developing plans to transfer work abroad.</P>

          <p><strong>*S2M-656</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Cairngorm 
            National Park - <em>P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta a' Ch&agrave;irn 
            Ghuirm</em></strong>-That the Parliament, while welcoming the designation 
            of the Cairngorm National Park, expresses concern that the provisional 
            Gaelic name being given to the park is P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta 
            a' Mhonaidh Ruaidh which translates as the Red Mountain National Park; 
            believes that this name is inaccurate and misleading as the national 
            park will contain both the Monadh Ruadh and the Monadh Liath mountain 
            ranges (Red and Blue mountains), and, in order to avoid confusion, 
            considers that the park's name should be the same in both English 
            and Gaelic, that is Cairngorm National Park and P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta 
            a' Ch&agrave;irn Ghuirm.</P>
          <p></P>
          <p><em>The member has provided the following Gaelic translation</em>:</P>
          <p></P>
          <p>Gu bheil a' Ph&agrave;rlamaid a' cur f&agrave;ilte air s&ograve;nrachadh 
            &quot;<em>Cairngorm National Park&quot;</em>, ach gu bheil i a' nochdadh 
            iomagain gu bheilear a' cleachdadh <em>P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta 
            a' Mhonaidh Ruaidh </em>mar ainm sealach, a dh' eadar-theangaicheas 
            dhan Bheurla mar <em>the Red Mountain National Park; </em>agus gu 
            bheil i den bheachd gu bheil seo ce&agrave;rr agus seachranach a chionn

            d&agrave; chuid sreath beantainn a' Mhonaidh Ruaidh agus sreath beantainn 
            a' Mhonaidh Liath; agus gu bheil i den bheachd, gus m&igrave;-thuigsinn

            sin Cairngorm National Park agus P&agrave;irc N&agrave;iseanta a' 
            Ch&agrave;irn Ghuirm.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-655#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Drug 
            Assisted Rape</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            properties of the drugs Rohypnol (roofies) and gamma hydroxybutyrate 
            (GHB, Liquid E or Liquid X), commonly known as &quot;date-rape&quot; 
            drugs or &quot;forget pills&quot; as the sedative effects are seven 
            to ten times greater than Valium; further notes the extensive foundation 
            work carried out by Detective Chief Inspector Peter Sturman of the 
            Metropolitan Police Serious Crime Group on the subject; welcomes the 
            banning of GHB in June 2003 because of government concerns over its 
            use in sexual attacks; further welcomes the Scottish Executive's plans 
            to respond to increasing public concern over date-rape drugs and to 
            take the matter seriously by running a major festive season information 
            campaign including leaflets, posters and videos in pubs and clubs 
            and, hopefully, also in universities, colleges and schools; notes 
            that although over 60 drug-related sexual abuse victims in Scotland 
            have, since 1997, contacted The Roofie Foundation which provides assistance 
            and support, fewer than 15% of victims report these crimes and in 
            Scotland only two convictions have ever taken place, and considers 
            that drug-assisted rape should be recognised as a major crime.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-650</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>G8 
            Summit</strong>-That the Parliament supports the efforts of the Scottish 
            Executive and others to make Scotland a regular venue for major international 
            events; welcomes the news that Scotland is being considered as a potential 
            venue for the G8 summit meeting; believes that such an event provides 
            an excellent opportunity to promote Scotland on the world stage as 
            well as providing economic benefits to local businesses, and believes 
            that St Andrews would be an ideal venue for such an event.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-649#</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Scots 
            Regiments</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the alleged 
            recommendations in the Ministry of Defence's review of the United 
            Kingdom armed forces and the impact that these will have on Scotland's 
            famous regiments; believes that, in a time of uncertainty due to international 
            turbulence and terrorism and with our forces deployed and over-stretched 
            throughout the world, our regiments, including the Black Watch, the 
            Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers, should be strengthened 
            and not cut back or disbanded, and considers that any proposals which 
            undermine or damage this objective are ill-timed, counter-productive 
            and fundamentally contrary to the national interest.</P>
