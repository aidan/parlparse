<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2458</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Save Scotland&rsquo;s National Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent comments by the General Secretary of UEFA who has given the starkest warning so far that a British football team performing at the Olympic Games would jeopardise Scotland&rsquo;s independent football status, stating that &quot;It is the quickest way for Scotland to disappear off of the international stage&quot;, and calls on all members who wish to see Scotland continue to participate in international football to use their influence to defend Scotland&rsquo;s footballing legacy and save Scotland&rsquo;s national team status.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2457</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Tackling Slum Housing in Govanhill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &pound;2 million additional funding to be provided by Glasgow City Council to tackle poor quality housing in Govanhill; wishes the new task force, headed by Environmental Services Director, Robert Booth, all the best in dealing with such an important problem; notes the desire of all residents in Govanhill to ensure that their area can be improved; calls on all agencies in the area to work with local residents to deal with persistent problems such as street litter, antisocial behaviour and poor housing; further notes the need to deal with slum landlords, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the city council to develop a coherent strategy on reducing the negative impact of such landlords and to find new money to invest in removing below tolerable standard housing once and for all in Govanhill.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2456</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of the Comments of Andrew Lansley and Defence of the NHS in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on Conservative UK Shadow Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley MP, to withdraw his comments suggesting that health spending should be reduced in Glasgow and spent elsewhere in the United Kingdom; believes that Mr Lansley&rsquo;s apparent conclusion that health spending is inverse to health outcomes and should therefore be reduced in areas of poor health is a perverse logic that risks denying people in most need the healthcare that they require and deserve and that this is an alarming indication of the Conservatives&rsquo; intention to cut NHS funding; notes with equal concern that Mr Lansley&rsquo;s wish may already be being granted by the SNP government in light of the recently announced &pound;42 million of cuts to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the fact that health spending in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget fails to match the year-on-year increases of both the UK Government for England and those of the previous Scottish administration; further notes that, if this trend continues, Scotland&rsquo;s historically higher health spending per head of population is at risk of being reversed within the next five years, and calls on members of all parties to defend the NHS in Scotland from further cuts and ensure that all people in Scotland of whatever financial means can access the healthcare that they deserve.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2455</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Report on Data Handling Review</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recalls that, in the context of high-profile government data losses, motion S3M-1017 was agreed on 13 December 2007 calling on the Scottish Government &quot;to ensure that all data protection procedures comply with the principles of data protection&quot;; welcomes the <em>Data Handling in Government </em>review report, published on June 25 2008, as a first step in fulfilling the terms of that motion and addressing concerns about government use of citizens&rsquo; data; considers, however that individuals&rsquo; right to privacy, and the control of data through the principle of consent, has not been fully explored in the report; recalls that motion S3M-1017 further calls on the Scottish Government &quot;to review plans for Scottish Citizens Accounts on the basis of these principles&quot;; notes that this has not been addressed at all in the report, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a ministerial statement to give details of the intended next steps and to allow Parliament to raise questions on the content of the report.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2454</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>End the Inhumane Long-Distance Transportation of Live Horses for Slaughter in Europe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the practice of the long-distance transportation of live horses for slaughter into and across the European Union involving an estimated 100,000 horses each year; believes that such a practice is indefensible in terms of animal welfare; also believes that existing legislation relating to such transportation and its enforcement are inadequate; supports an early review introducing short finite journey limits and space allowances that reflect the welfare needs of horses and, thereafter, rigorous enforcement by all EU member states of EU Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005, which governs the transport of live vertebrate animals within the European Union in connection with an economic activity, and supports the Make a Noise campaign by World Horse Welfare to end the inhumane transportation of horses within the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2453</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Team GB, Especially Scotland&rsquo;s Athletes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the athletes from Team GB who have performed incredibly well in the 2008 Beijing Olympics; recognises the commitment and togetherness of Team GB in its pursuit of sporting excellence; commends the achievement of 47 medals, including 19 gold medals; congratulates Chris Hoy on his achievement of three gold medals and on being the first British Olympian in 100 years to win three gold medals in a single games; considers that calls for a separate Scottish Olympics team from the First Minister are divisive and unnecessary, and calls on the First Minister to spend more of his time finding resources to invest in sport and facilities in Scotland rather than depending on the legacy of the previous Labour/Liberal Democrat administration and to listen to the Scottish Olympians, such as Chris Hoy and Allan Wells, on how best to support Scottish athletes in the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2451</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>St Enoch&rsquo;s Clock, Cumbernauld</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the apparent disregard shown by London and Regional Properties, owners of the Antonine Centre in Cumbernauld, towards the iconic St Enoch&rsquo;s Clock, which formerly hung in St Enoch&rsquo;s train station, Glasgow, and was gifted to the New Town of Cumbernauld; believes that the clock is a local symbol deserving of a more prominent location within the shopping mall, and praises the efforts of the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth branch of the Young Scots for Independence in campaigning on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2450</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Unclaimed Pensioner Benefits at &pound;4.6 Billion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes figures published by Age Concern Scotland estimating that there are &pound;4.6 billion in pensioner benefits that go unclaimed across the United Kingdom each year; further notes that the estimates are that at least 1 in 3 of those eligible for the main Pension Credit do not claim, at least 1 in 5 do not claim the minimum income guarantee component, at least 1 in 7 do not claim Council Tax Benefit and at least 1 in 9 do not claim Housing Benefit; believes that these figures are unacceptably high, especially given the rising costs of domestic bills such as for food and energy and that the additional income can be genuinely life-changing; welcomes the campaign by Age Concern to address this widespread problem; urges government at all levels to do all it can to simplify access to these entitlements; welcomes steps towards this objective such as the recently launched Age Concern projects in partnership with the Scottish and UK governments, and further urges all other concerned bodies to step up efforts to raise awareness and uptake of these benefits so that all of Scotland&rsquo;s pensioners receive the support they deserve.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2447</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Breaking Israel&rsquo;s Blockade of Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, further to motion S3M-2411 in the name of Bashir Ahmad, congratulates the passengers and crew of <em>SS Free Gaza </em>and <em>SS Liberty </em>on breaking the Israeli blockade of Gaza; notes that their effort has had the immediate benefit of enabling Palestinian fishermen to enter fishing waters barred to them by Israel and therefore to land the best catch that they have had in four years; urges Israel to lift its blockade of Gaza entirely and immediately, and believes that such a step, as well as alleviating the terrible suffering of the inhabitants of Gaza, would be in the long-term best interests of both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2437#</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Farming&rsquo;s Retreat from the Hills</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the Scottish Agricultural College report,<em> Farming&rsquo;s Retreat from the Hills,</em> detailing the dramatic and ongoing decline in sheep and, to a lesser extent, cattle numbers on Scotland&rsquo;s hills; notes in particular that between 1998 and 2007 the national sheep flock declined by around 2.3 million animals with the impact especially felt in less favoured areas such as the north west Highlands and Ayrshire; further notes the potentially negative implications of this decline on wider rural economies and biodiversity, and therefore considers that all relevant agencies should carefully examine the findings of the report and consider what measures might be taken to alleviate the problems it outlines.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2434</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Grid Connection Charge Scandal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the announcement by the UK Government that it is to stop subsidies for renewable energy developments in Orkney and Shetland and its comment that there is only a marginal case for keeping them in the Western Isles; believes that this move will place a real question mark over Scotland realising its full renewable energy potential in tidal, wave and wind power; recognises that with this new policy the UK Government is making it less attractive to set up renewable schemes away from the south east of England, which will adversely affect Scotland&rsquo;s remote and rural economies; further believes that this announcement will not lead to a reduction of carbon emissions, and therefore calls on the UK Government to rethink its decision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2433</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Green Pig Project Begun</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes news of the trialling of animal feed made from home-grown protein; in particular, congratulates the Scottish Agricultural College for backing the international research collaboration on the Green Pig project, which plans to use appropriate home-grown legume varieties to reduce the importation of expensive soybean meal; recognises the need to drastically reduce both soya imports that impact adversely on the environmental and social needs of producer countries and the expensive long-distance transport costs of this high-protein animal feed for use by Scottish livestock producers; further notes the likely benefits of the lower input of nitrogen required by home-grown alternatives such as oilseed rape, and believes that the excellent pedigree earned by Scottish scientists in conventional plant breeding can best be deployed to develop high-protein animal feed on Scottish farms and crofts that will take a natural and essential place in national food policy.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2431</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Clostridium Difficile Public Inquiry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing should instruct a public inquiry into the deaths from Clostridium difficile at the Vale of Leven Hospital and at other hospitals in Scotland; notes that such an inquiry can be instructed by Scottish Ministers under the Inquiries Act 2005, where it appears that particular events have caused, or are capable of causing, public concern, or there is public concern that particular events may have occurred; further notes that the matter is not reserved within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998; recognises that there are wider lessons to be learned for all of the NHS in Scotland in preventing and tackling Clostridium difficile, the incidence of which is increasing; acknowledges and supports the families of those affected by Clostridium difficile at the Vale of Leven Hospital in their continuing call for a public inquiry, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, in the interests of openness and transparency, to instigate such an inquiry without further delay.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2426</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Impact of the Thatcher Government&rsquo;s Economic Policies on Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments by the First Minister suggesting that Scotland &quot;didn&rsquo;t mind&quot; the Thatcher Conservative government&rsquo;s economic policies; remembers with concern the misery experienced by the three million unemployed in the 1980s when the economic consequences of Thatcherism reached their nadir; understands the devastating impact that the Thatcher government&rsquo;s policies had on mining, the steel industry, dockyards and communities across Scotland; further notes that the First Minister has also expressed support for  Reaganomics; worries that supply-side economics, a largely discredited economic theory, could become a model for the Scottish economy, and hopes that the Scottish Government will not pursue a right-wing economic agenda at the expense of Scotland&rsquo;s working people and their families.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2405</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Closure of G41/G42 Local Newspapers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is saddened by the closure of G41/G42 local newspapers, run by Southside Media in Glasgow; feels that this comes at a time when the areas of G41/G42 need a community newspaper more than ever to build up and encourage community spirit and action and communicate grassroots and local news; expresses concern that local projects and community groups may now not gain the coverage and local profile they need to thrive, and congratulates David Eyre and all the team on the hard work and dedication they put in to produce these very informative newspapers, for both encouraging and supporting local activism and for bringing people on the Southside together on the very successful G41/G42 community forums.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2405.1</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Closure of G41/G42 Local Newspapers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2405) in the name of Robert Brown, insert at end &quot;and is further concerned at the closure of community newspapers in other parts of Scotland, such as Edinburgh, where the Liberal Democrat/SNP-run council has withdrawn all financial support from the Edinburgh Community Newspaper Trust with the resulting closure of two community newspapers and continuing uncertainty for the others.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2148#</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Upgrading of the A92</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the campaign to dual the A92 from Glenrothes to the Melville Lodge roundabout in north east Fife and as a priority to upgrade the Parbroath junction, which is the only major intersection between Kirkcaldy and Dundee without a roundabout; commends the efforts of local people campaigning to upgrade the section between Preston roundabout and Balfarg junction, and notes that in terms of accidents the A92 is one of the most dangerous roads in Scotland with over 600 accidents in the last five years.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2011#</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Enforcement of Planning Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the difficulties faced by planning authorities, such as Fife Council, in attempting to deal with breaches of planning legislation through enforcement and stop notices; considers that development without the appropriate planning approval undermines the rule of law and the planning process and that the present planning legislation does not provide a sufficient safeguard against unlawful development; believes that appeals against enforcement or stop notices should not be permitted on the grounds that planning permission for the development would have been granted or that a planning application for the development has been submitted; further believes that there should be a presumption against approval for any development that has been carried out without the appropriate planning approvals, and desires further debate on these proposals.</p>
