         <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an "R".</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2225#</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Renfrew and Inverclyde Scout Association - Lapwing Lodge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the good works carried out by voluntary organisations in Scotland; notes that Renfrew and Inverclyde Scout Association, supported by East Renfrewshire Council, has made a funding application to the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund &ndash; Local Capital Grants Scheme for the modernisation of facilities at Lapwing Lodge, Renfrewshire, to increase the flexibility of the facility and allow a wider range of groups to access Lapwing, beyond the 40% usage currently enjoyed by community groups, and to ensure the long-term sustainability of this outdoor centre for the next 25 years and beyond; recognises the value of such centres, and consequently wishes Renfrew and Inverclyde Scout Association every success in its funding application.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2224#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Perth City Bid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Perth, whilst an ecclesiastical city, does not have the legal status of city conferred on Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, Inverness and Stirling; recognises Perth&rsquo;s historical and present day importance to Scotland and its contribution to Scotland economically, culturally and socially; believes that Perth has all the qualities that are taken into account when a place is being considered for city status, including notable features, regional significance, history, and a forward-looking attitude; is concerned that, without legal city status, Perth does not gain the benefits that the six legal cities in Scotland enjoy, for example in relation to Scottish Executive funding or as the centre of possible future city regions for planning purposes; believes, therefore that Perth deserves full legal recognition of city status, and considers that when the next opportunity arises for a Scottish bid for the creation of a new city the Scottish Executive should support a bid from Perth.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2223</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Stoddard International PLC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern that the receivers have been called into Stoddard International PLC, Kilmarnock, and urges all public agencies and politicians to work towards attracting a new owner who will sustain jobs for the loyal workforce and preserve the valuable skills of the carpet industry of Scotland in Kilmarnock.</p>
         <p>Supported by: Elaine Smith<strong>*</strong>, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Kate Maclean<strong>*</strong>, Paul Martin<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong>, Janis Hughes<strong>*</strong>, Ms Wendy Alexander<strong>*</strong></p>
         <p> <strong>*S2M-2222</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> <strong>Christmas Card Recycling Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that more than 100 million Christmas cards were sent in 2004 in Scotland but that last year only around 5% of cards sent in 2003 were recycled; welcomes the scheme promoted by the Woodland Trust and backed by Waste Aware Scotland; urges people to double the amount recycled by taking their cards to special recycling bins placed in WH Smith and Tesco stores throughout January, and notes that the funds raised from the scheme will contribute towards the Woodland Trust&rsquo;s major new tree planting campaign &quot;Tree For All&quot; which will see two million native trees planted throughout Scotland with the help of thousands of children.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2221</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Curl Aberdeen - A New Curling Rink for Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Curl Aberdeen Project Group for their efforts in securing the funding for the construction of Aberdeen&rsquo;s new state-of-the-art curling rink; welcomes the opening of the new facility, and hopes that this new centre and its staff will attract newcomers to the sport and will help encourage, train and cultivate a new crop of Scottish, world and Olympic curling champions.</p>
         <p>Supported by: Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
         <p> <strong>*S2M-2220</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Women&rsquo;s Hospital at Royaumont</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the commemoration, as part of the centenary celebrations of the Entente Cordiale, of the Scottish Women&rsquo;s Hospital at Royaumont which cared for wounded French soldiers from 1915 to 1919, while also remembering the Scottish Women&rsquo;s Hospitals in Serbia, Russia, Romania and Greece.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2219#</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin:</strong> <strong>School Zones</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that evidence suggests that local authorities do not have available sufficient funding to ensure that every primary school has road safety measures in place that minimise the potential for injury or worse to schoolchildren on roads around their schools; therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that &quot;School Zone&quot; road safety areas are created around every primary school in Scotland by either providing local authorities with sufficient funding to create such zones or by making the creation of such zones a responsibility of the Parliament, with funding provided directly by the Scottish Executive, and recognises that in the document, <em>Review of Research on School Travel</em>, produced on behalf of the Executive by the Derek Haldane Consultancy and published by the Scottish Executive Central Research Unit in 2002, reference is made in Chapter 4 (General) at 4.12 (Infrastructure and Enforcement) to the fact that for traffic calming schemes to improve safety, &quot;They must be properly signed, well designed and use physical features appropriate for the local environment&quot;, but that, at present, roads around most primary schools in Scotland do not have any physical impediments to speed, such as chicanes and humps in the road.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2218#</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Scotland on the Internet</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that promotion of Scotland as a brand is vital to our economic success; believes that a distinctive internet identity via a top-level domain (TLD), such as .SCOTLAND, .SCOT, .SCO or similar, has an increasingly important role to play, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should promote the research necessary to allow the submission of an early bid to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) for an appropriate TLD.</p>
         <p>Supported by: Jim Mather, Robin Harper, Rob Gibson</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2217</strong> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> <strong>New Nuclear Power Stations in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the comments of the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in the <em>Sunday Herald</em> on 26 December 2004 calling for a debate on the future role for nuclear power as an energy source in Scotland; welcomes the earlier comments by the Secretary of State for Scotland stating that new nuclear power stations in Scotland had not been ruled out by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government; believes that new nuclear power stations would provide Scotland with a safe and secure energy supply in the future and mitigate the prospect of an energy gap leading to power cuts and blackouts; calls on the Scottish Executive to clarify its policy on future nuclear development in Scotland, and notes the suitability of the Chapelcross site near Annan for the location of a new nuclear power station.</p>
         <p><strong><a name="2216" id="2216"></a>*S2M-2216#</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Earthquake and Tsunami Which Hit the Coasts of South Asia on Boxing Day 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is horrified by the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami which hit southern Asia and parts of Africa on Boxing Day, 2004; mourns the enormous loss of lives from Malaysia to Somalia, particularly in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, more than half of whom are expected to be children; congratulates NGOs like Oxfam, the Red Cross, the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund and others for their instant and courageous response; is concerned that this region did not have the benefit of an early warning system, despite the fact that it sits on a known fault line; is concerned at the initial level of aid offered by the UK Government and believes that the current promised aid is inadequate and should be increased to meet the needs of the entire region; encourages everyone in Scotland to help in any way they can, commensurate with their means, and considers that the Scottish Executive and those in power should set an example above and beyond the support of the Scottish people to ensure that Scotland sends a clear message of support in both words and deeds.</p>
         <p><strong>S2M-2209#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Sustaining Agriculture and Sustaining Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that sustaining a viable agricultural sector involves encouraging an increase in employment on Scotland&rsquo;s land and that this would strengthen the contribution of agriculture to the viability of rural communities and contribute to the nutritional health of Scotland.</p>
         <p><strong>S2M-2190</strong> <strong>Robert Brown on behalf of the Education Committee:</strong> <strong>Education Committee Report on Child Protection Issues</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 8th Report, 2004 (Session 2) of the Education Committee: <em>Report on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Implementation of Recommendations of the &quot;It&rsquo;s Everyone&rsquo;s Job To Make Sure I&rsquo;m Alright&quot; Report </em>(SP Paper 201); notes the Executive&rsquo;s response to the report, and draws the attention of the Executive to the impact of disclosure requirements, particularly in light of the implementation of the provisions of the Protection of Children (Scotland) Act 2003.</p>
         <p><strong><a name="2118" id="2118"></a>S2M-2118</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Gambling Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the principle of including in the Gambling Bill provisions which confer powers on the Scottish Ministers, including powers to set fees and make regulations on the conditions to be attached to gambling premises&rsquo; licences and permits, and agrees that the relevant provisions to achieve this end should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
