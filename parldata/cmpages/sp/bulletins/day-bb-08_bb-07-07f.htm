<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2307</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Successful Liberation of Ingrid Bethancourt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the audacious release of Ingrid Bethancourt and 14 other hostages held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) this week without a shot being fired; notes that Ingrid Bethancourt is a French-Columbian politician, leader of the Colombia Green Party (Partido Verde Oxigeno), former presidential candidate and brave champion of peace and democracy in Columbia; further congratulates all those who have campaigned for her release during the six years of her captivity; condemns the actions of FARC and calls for the freedom of around 700 hostages still held by FARC, and supports a peaceful future for Ingrid Bethancourt and all in Columbia.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2306</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Bright Future for Scottish Shipbuilding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the signing of contract agreements for the two new aircraft carriers securing the future of many jobs in the Rosyth and Govan shipyards and is delighted that, despite incorrect assertions that 50,000 jobs could go and the misleading claim that the report published by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons warned that the sustainability of these jobs would be put under threat by constitutional change, politicians have noted that it was the workforce and the city of Glasgow which made the case for continuing to build ships on the Clyde because they convinced government that Scotland is as competitive as Poland and yards in the far east.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2305</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Centre of Excellence Honour for Bishopbriggs Academy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Bishopbriggs Academy for becoming an international &quot;Centre of Excellence&quot; after being chosen for a special link-up with Germany; notes that Bishopbriggs Academy is the only school in Scotland to be selected for this prestigious partnership which will see the school join a network of 1,000 schools worldwide in a promotion of the learning and teaching of German; further notes that the partnership was signed by headteacher Gordon Moulsdale with Dr Heike Uhlig from the Goethe-Institut and Consul-General Ingo Radcke, and believes that this partnership will only enhance Scotland&rsquo;s reputation internationally and will give the pupils of Bishopbriggs Academy a great opportunity to learn the German language and broaden their horizons.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2304</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Pringle of Scotland No More</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the recent decision by Pringle of Scotland to end production of its manufacturing operations in Hawick, bringing to an end almost 200 years of production in Scotland; notes further that Pringle relies heavily on the &quot;Scottish brand&quot; to market its products and considers that it should desist from using the Lion Rampant emblem and any reference to Scotland in its marketing which, in the circumstances, is entirely misleading, and further urges the Scottish Government to explore all legal avenues to prevent the use of these Scottish references should the company fail to do so voluntarily.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2303</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Science Centre Job Losses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled at the announcement by Glasgow Science Centre that it is being required to shed one-fifth of its workforce as a &quot;direct consequence&quot; of funding cuts of 40% over the period to 2010 imposed by the SNP government; is concerned at the complacency of SNP ministers in the face of this threat to Scotland&rsquo;s only internationally-ranked science centre and to support for science and science education in Scotland; notes that the Scottish Government has been compelled to make available a further &pound;250,000 of funding but is concerned that this appears to be a one-year concession only, that it is unclear how or to whom it is to be distributed and that it does not appear to resolve the major cuts in core funding made by the SNP government, and urges the Scottish Government to take immediate action to rescind its damaging funding cuts and enable Glasgow Science Centre to continue and build on its good work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2302</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Annan Athletic FC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Henry McLelland and all involved in Annan Athletic Football Club on its success in being selected to join the Scottish Football League and looks forward to its participation in the Third Division next season.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2301</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Labour&rsquo;s Super Tax on the Poor</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the continuing unfairness of the UK Government&rsquo;s tax and benefit system whereby there is a loss of housing benefit at 65 pence in the pound and of council tax benefit at 20 pence in the pound for every pound earned over the benefit thresholds, effectively a super tax of 85%; calls for an improved tax and benefit system that does not penalise those experiencing poverty for small rises in their income, and notes that a local income tax would be part of such a fairer system.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2300</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Wind Farm Moratorium on Peat Lands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s research report, <em>Calculating carbon savings from wind farms on Scottish peat lands</em>, and the analysis that the total carbon payback period for wind farms constructed on peat lands is typically under three years; condemns calls for a moratorium on wind farm developments on peat land as without scientific basis and damaging both to action against climate change and the renewable energy industry, and calls on government, industry and environmental bodies to continue to work together to ensure good practice and protection for biodiversity on Scottish peat lands.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2299</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Funding for Data Sharing Partnerships</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the cut by two-thirds in Scottish Government funding via the Transformational Technologies Division (TTD) to the 14 Data Sharing Partnerships (DSP) and the proposed ending of all TTD funding for 2009-10; believes that the delivery of data sharing is central to delivery of the Parliament&rsquo;s and Scottish Government&rsquo;s priorities in support of vulnerable adults and children facing difficulties in families with drug, alcohol, mental health or other problems; further notes that the DSPs will now have to apply to 32 local authorities and 14 NHS boards, including submitting separate draft plans and programmes for each authority, and all for only &pound;150,000 each; condemns this as a massive loss of efficiency, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that these programmes are not disrupted by ensuring that they are part of every local authority single outcome agreement and NHS board accountability review.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2298</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales Contracts Signed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that the main manufacturing contracts for the two super aircraft carriers have been signed; notes that the final commissioning of these massive 65,000 tonne ships will be conducted at Rosyth Dockyard in Fife; believes that this is recognition of the excellent skills of the workforce at Babcock; calls on the Scottish and UK governments to maximise the opportunity that this presents for local businesses and local people through skills development, sub-contracting and other means, and further calls on the two governments to ensure the effects of this construction project are felt long after the two carriers sail under the Forth Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2297</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Funding Boost for Science Centres</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of extra funding for Scotland&rsquo;s science centres; notes that this funding will be specifically earmarked to encourage children to become more interested in science, and believes that, given the recent report showing underachievement and lack of interest in science, this extra funding along with other initiatives such as the science engagement scheme, is positive and encouraging.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2297.1</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Funding Boost for Science Centres</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2297) in the name of Sandra White, insert at end &quot;but notes the irony that this motion should be circulated on the very day that the Glasgow Science Centre announced that its workforce would be cut by one-fifth as a &quot;direct consequence&quot; of the SNP government cutting core funding to Glasgow Science Centre by 40%, totalling over &pound;600,000 per annum by 2010, and wonders how these savage cutbacks will encourage children to become more interested in science.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2296</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Glasgow East By-Election</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the Labour Party for its decision to call the Glasgow East by-election on 24 July 2008 in the middle of the Glasgow Fair, when Glaswegians are traditionally on holiday; is aware that such a decision will disenfranchise thousands of voters who will be unable to secure a postal or proxy vote in a constituency that already has a history of low electoral turnouts; believes that Labour&rsquo;s decision to call the by-election so quickly is due to a chronic fear of the SNP winning one of its safest seats; considers that calling a by-election so swiftly does not allow voters time to effectively assess the merits of individual candidates and policies, and is of the view that for the democratic process to work effectively by-elections should be held not less than eight weeks after the writ is moved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2296.1</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Glasgow East By-Election</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2296) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out from &quot;believes that Labour&rsquo;s&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes, however, the SNP&rsquo;s poor electoral record in Westminster elections and that the Liberal Democrats are the challengers to Labour in Scotland at that level, with 12 seats to the SNP&rsquo;s six and with the most recent by-election gain in Scotland being by the Liberal Democrats at Dunfermline and West Fife; further notes that the SNP is in any event largely irrelevant in Westminster elections, with one of their most senior MPs hardly ever in attendance, and believes that the electorate in Glasgow East is more than capable of identifying both the failures of the Labour Government at Westminster and the many u-turns and broken promises that are the hallmark of the SNP government, including those on class sizes, police numbers, student debt, first-time buyer grants and slashed support for Glasgow Science Centre.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2296.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Glasgow East By-Election</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2296) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out from &quot;condemns&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that if a by-election is not held in Glasgow East now, the earliest that the rules permit a by-election to be held is at the end of October 2008; notes that when an MP resigns, a writ for a by-election cannot be moved during the summer, unlike when an MP dies or is elevated to the peerage; believes that the people of Glasgow East should not go without a voice for four months; supports the decision to call a by-election now, and condemns the SNP for trying to deny the people of Glasgow East a voice until the end of October.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2295</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Pringle of Scotland Job Losses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deeply regrets the news that Pringle of Scotland is proposing to stop manufacturing in Hawick, with the loss of eighty jobs; notes that Pringle&rsquo;s history in the Borders dates back to 1815, when it was founded in Hawick by Robert Pringle, and from when it has built up a worldwide reputation as a luxury fashion brand; further regrets that due to the fragility of the Hawick economy and relatively high rates of unemployment, job losses on this scale are bound to have serious consequences unless help is urgently brought in; calls on the Scottish Government to set up a taskforce to help the staff affected by this decision, with the taskforce including Scottish Borders Council, the employment service and Heriot-Watt University, and believes that all the staff that lose their jobs should be given individually tailored help to ensure that they are either re-employed or retrained as quickly as possible.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2295.1</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Pringle of Scotland Job Losses</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2295) in the name of Jim Hume, insert at end &quot;further regrets the premature comments from Jim Hume MSP earlier this year when he may have given false hope to many of the Hawick workforce by stating in the local press that the firm had committed to stay in the town and that he &quot;would be working with them in the future to this end&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to take action to prevent textiles firms from using the &quot;Made in Scotland&quot; label and other such Scottish branding inappropriately.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2294</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>Social Energy Tariffs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the agreement for the UK&rsquo;s energy suppliers to spend &pound;150 million a year on initiatives to help the fuel poor by March 2011; views with concern the fact that initiatives being proposed include social tariffs that are more expensive than the supplier&rsquo;s best offer; notes that Ofgem&rsquo;s definition sets the threshold for a social tariff rate as being &quot;at least as good as the suppliers standard direct debit tariff&quot;; further notes that since many fuel-poor households currently pay by direct debit, a significant proportion of people living in fuel poverty are effectively excluded from any additional assistance; believes that recent price increases and the potential for further price increases means there is an urgent need for additional assistance that reaches fuel-poor households, and supports representations made to Ofgem and the major energy suppliers by Energywatch and a coalition of NGOs that would require social tariffs offered to those hit hardest by increasing energy prices to mean the lowest tariffs that suppliers offer on the market.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2293</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the NHS is the largest single organisation in the United Kingdom and further notes that the energy used in NHS healthcare facilities costs &pound;400 million annually with a total annual emission of approximately one million tonnes of carbon; commends the British Medical Association (BMA)&rsquo;s recent report on how health professionals can take action on climate change; supports the recommendations by the BMA for health professionals and healthcare organisations to reduce their carbon footprint while protecting and promoting the health of the public by (a) investing in preventive healthcare and treatment for the health implications relating to climate change such as problems caused by an increase in temperature, flooding and infectious diseases and (b) applying simple measures such as using energy saving lighting, recycling and turning off electrical equipment at the plug when not in use, and commends the Royal Cornhill Hospital in Aberdeen as an excellent example of good practice of an NHS organisation taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-2275</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Working Creatively for Scotland: Glasgow Science Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the important contribution that Scotland&rsquo;s science centres, particularly Glasgow Science Centre, make to Scotland; notes the ongoing talks between the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and science centre managers, and urges the Scottish Government to ensure adequate funding to enable Glasgow Science Centre and others to work creatively for science in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2275.1</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Working Creatively for Scotland: Glasgow Science Centre</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2275) in the name of Sandra White, insert at end &quot;regrets however that the Scottish Government saw fit to slash funding for the Glasgow Science Centre by 40%; believes that such a funding level, if not remedied following the Cabinet Secretary&rsquo;s discussions, will damage the ability of the Glasgow Science Centre to maintain and develop its services and to inspire young people in Glasgow and across Scotland with interest in science,&nbsp;and&nbsp;regrets the low priority the SNP government appears to give to supporting and encouraging interest in science in Scotland.&quot;</p>
