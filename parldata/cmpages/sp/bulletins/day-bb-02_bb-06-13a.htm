                      <p>9.30 am&#9;Debate on Youth Justice&#151;</p>
                      <p><strong>S1M-3194</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> 
                        <strong>Youth Justice</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
                        notes with concern that there are youths out on the street 
                        causing violence, causing disorder, causing vandalism 
                        and graffiti and terrifying not just older people but 
                        other young people; acknowledges that the problems of 
                        youth disorder must be given a high priority if the right 
                        to peace and security at home and in the community is 
                        to be protected; further notes that diverting 16- and 
                        17-year-olds to the Children&#146;s Hearings System will 
                        only defer effective deterrents and place an extra burden 
                        on a process which is already overstretched and not respected 
                        by the young offenders, and therefore calls upon the Scottish 
                        Executive to introduce an increased range of disposals, 
                        including weekend and evening detention, expansion of 
                        supervised attendance orders and community service and 
                        grounding, coupled with an increase in secure accommodation 
                        and a substantial increase in the number of community 
                        police officers to help make our streets safer. </p>

                            local communities where a disproportionate amount 
                            of crime and disorder is caused by a small number 
                            of persistent offenders; considers it a priority to 
                            reduce youth disorder and youth offending; welcomes 
                            Scotland&#146;s Action Plan to reduce youth crime 
                            and the establishment of Youth Justice Teams in each 
                            local authority; believes that effective disposals 
                            and programmes must be available to the Children&#146;s 
                            Hearing System which make young offenders face up 
                            to the consequences of their behaviour; supports all 
                            parties involved in the youth justice system to play 
                            a full role and be accountable for their actions, 
                            and welcomes the Executive&#146;s continuing focus 
                            on improving the youth justice system in order to 
                            reduce youth crime, the fear of youth crime and build 
                            safer communities.&quot; </p>

                            about the levels of youth crime; regrets the failure 
                            of the Scottish Executive to take effective action 
                            to tackle such crime; believes that tackling youth 
                            crime effectively and appropriately is a key element 
                            in reducing overall levels of crime and fear of crime, 
                            and calls upon the Executive to introduce practical 
                            measures to prevent youth crime and to ensure that 
                            there are sufficient places so that those young offenders 
                            who, for their own sake, need to be looked after in 
                            secure accommodation are held in conditions appropriate

                        meet the needs of their pupils; further believes in the 
                        fundamental importance of diversity in education; supports 
                        the view that the elimination of denominational schools

                            damaging fisheries policies including the proposed 
                            inappropriate regulation of the deep-sea fishery, 
                            and calls on the Minister for Environment and Rural 
                            Development to demand that he leads the UK&#146;s
