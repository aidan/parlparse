         <p><strong> Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

         <p><strong> * S2M-2560 Richard Baker:Aberdeen Jobcentre&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the excellent efforts by staff at the Jobcentre Plus in Chapel Street, Aberdeen, in beating its targets for filling job vacancies; congratulates the staff for winning the organisation&rsquo;s top award for 2004 in reflection of their efforts in securing more than 150 jobs against a target of 64 in the last three months of 2004, and supports the Jobcentre in continuing its successful work in reducing unemployment in Aberdeen. </p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2559 Rob Gibson:Clearances Denial&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with astonishment recent claims by &ldquo;historian&rdquo; Michael Fry, previewing his forthcoming book, that the Highland clearances were a myth; questions the author&rsquo;s selective use of source material; deplores his assertion that the Sutherland clearances were an early example of deliberate displacement of people similar to the housing policies of the post-World War Two Labour government, and recognises that throughout the Highlands and Islands many thousands of people were forcibly evicted from their ancestral lands and that depopulated glens, straths and islands remain a testament to those clearances to this day. </p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2558 Trish Godman:Commemoration of the Scottish Women&rsquo;s Suffrage Movement&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the decision to commemorate, by way of sculpture to be placed in the Parliament, the important heroic campaign waged by numerous members of the Scottish Women&rsquo;s Suffrage Movement to attain the goal of universal suffrage and the extension of women&rsquo;s rights here in Scotland and elsewhere; remembers the barbaric treatment inflicted upon those women campaigners when imprisoned in Perth Prison and other prisons; also recalls the admirable and sustained support given to the movement by a relatively small number of male politicians amongst whose thin ranks were the estimable Keir Hardie and Tom Johnston, editor of the radical newspaper, <em>The Forward</em>, and firmly believes that such brave, stoical women played a crucial part in the emancipation of women in the 20th century which is too often ignored by modern historians but which today can be seen as a significant element in the democratic improvement in women&rsquo;s economic, social, political, community and democratic rights.</p>
         <p> Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2557 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:Save School Boards&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises the invaluable contribution to the school community made by school boards; opposes the proposals made in the draft Scottish Schools (Parental Involvement) Bill to repeal the School Boards Act 1988; notes that under the proposed legislation school boards will lose their statutory rights governing the appointment of headteachers and deputy headteachers; trusts that the Scottish Executive will give due consideration to the results of the consultation process, and calls for further independent research into parental involvement and participation.</p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2556 Brian Adam:Proposed Closure of BPB Papermill at Mugiemoss, Aberdeen&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament expresses grave concern at the proposal by BPB Paperboard to close its paper mill at Mugiemoss in Aberdeen; regrets the impact that the jobs losses will have on the 276 staff directly employed by BPB as well as others employed on the site and elsewhere whose livelihoods are at risk; calls for a full consultation between the management of BPB Paperboard and trade union representatives at the mill; urges the setting up of a multi-agency taskforce, such as was done in respect of the recent Richards plc closure, to support the staff, and further calls on the Scottish Executive to take action to address the impact of the proposed closure on the local economy and the long-term future of papermaking in Scotland.</p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2555 Stewart Stevenson:Congratulations to Peterhead FC&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates players, staff and management of Peterhead Football Club on achieving promotion to the Scottish Football League Second Division and looks forward to their continuing success in seasons and competitions to come.</p>

         <p><strong> * S2M-2554.1 Jim Mather:Infrastructure Investment Plan&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2554) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, leave out from &ldquo;acknowledges&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;and regrets that this investment is not being matched with other credible measures by the Scottish Executive that could genuinely and incrementally increase sustainable economic growth in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2554.2 Mr Brian Monteith:Infrastructure Investment Plan&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2554) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, leave out from &ldquo;welcomes&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;recognises the substantial level of capital invested in infrastructure in Scotland by successive Conservative governments between 1979 and 1997 which included, amongst many projects, the M8 motorway extension, the Edinburgh City Bypass, upgrade of the A74 to motorway status, the first M77 motorway section, dualling of the A90 and key sections of the A96, the Dunblane by-pass, dualling of sections of the A9, dualling of the A1 between Edinburgh and Haddington, the St James Interchange at Glasgow Airport, dualling of the northern stretch of the A737, dualling of the A78 to by-pass Troon and Loans, dualling of the A71 from Irvine to Kilmarnock, the Dornoch Firth Bridge, the Kessock Bridge, the Kylesku Bridge, reopening of the Edinburgh to Bathgate railway line, electrification of the East Coast main line, electrification of the North Berwick spur line, electrification of the Glasgow to Ayr railway line, the Skye Bridge development, a new ferry service between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland, a new air traffic control centre, the redevelopment of Aberdeen Airport, &pound;8 billion invested on council houses across Scotland, the New Life for Urban Scotland programme, Western Isles Hospital, Caithness Hospital, medicine for the elderly wards and a day hospital at Perth Royal Infirmary, a neo-natal intensive care ward and a midwife-led unit at Forth Park Hospital, a new phase of the Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline, St John&rsquo;s Hospital at Livingston, Ayr Hospital, major refurbishment to Stirling Royal Infirmary, major refurbishment to Falkirk Royal Infirmary, HM Prison Shotts Phase 2, Peterhead Power Station, Torness Power Station, Greengairs Power Station, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, the Edinburgh Festival Theatre, the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, the Dean Gallery, the Royal Museum of Scotland extension and renovation of the National Library of Scotland; recalls that many of the infrastructure achievements that the Scottish Executive now takes credit for, such as seven new hospital developments, namely the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Wishaw General Hospital, Hairmyres Hospital, East Ayrshire Community Hospital, Glasgow Royal Infirmary extension, the Western General Hospital extension and Southern Isles Community Hospital, were in fact part of the Conservative Scottish Office programme; reminds members of the Parliament that the Scottish Office between 1997 and 1999 postponed further infrastructure projects by introducing a moratorium on roads spending for two years which delayed initiatives such as the A8000 upgrade to dual carriageway, the new Kincardine Bridge, the Kincardine Bypass and the M74 extension; is pleased to celebrate this year the 10th anniversary of the National Lottery which brought a new and very substantial income stream for capital investment in public buildings that would otherwise not have been built or renovated; notes that increases in spending by the Executive have not led to improvements in service delivery; believes that the Executive has thus far demonstrated that it has a poor record of spending taxpayers&rsquo; money wisely; welcomes the fact that the Executive is open to working across public and private sectors in order to ensure that we have the modern infrastructure Scotland needs, and believes, however, that in order to support economic growth the Executive needs to cut business rates to at least the same poundage as in England, invest more significantly in roads and transport, open up Scottish Water to full competition and greater investment through privatisation and cut red tape.&rdquo; </p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2549.1 Mr Andy Kerr:NHS Dentistry&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2549) in the name of Shona Robison, leave out from &ldquo;is concerned&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;recognises the need to tackle Scotland&rsquo;s poor oral health and improve access to NHS dental services; acknowledges the actions already taken by the Scottish Executive to improve oral health and to recruit and retain dental professionals in the NHS; recognises that further work needs to be undertaken to respond to the outcome of the consultations, Towards Better Oral Health in Children and Modernising NHS Dental Services in Scotland; notes that the Executive&rsquo;s response to the consultations, to be published very shortly, will include measures to address the Partnership Agreement commitments on workforce numbers, training and prevention including free dental checks and will identify the resources needed, and calls on NHS boards, higher education institutions, local authorities, the British Dental Association and the wider professions to engage positively with the Executive after publication to bring early and sustained benefits to the oral health of people in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

         <p><strong> * S2M-2549.3 Carolyn Leckie:NHS Dentistry&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2549) in the name of Shona Robison, leave out from &ldquo;meet this pledge&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;improve the health of Scotland&rsquo;s people and to safeguard the future of NHS dentistry there should be a legal obligation on NHS boards to provide NHS dental services which are accessible by local communities and the Scottish Executive must provide incentives for dentists to undertake more preventive work including a significant increase in the fee level for oral health assessments, assist dentists more with infrastructure costs in return for greater NHS commitment, reduce bureaucracy and simplify the current fee scale and expand the number of NHS salaried dentists on negotiated terms and conditions and the provision of core children&rsquo;s dental services through revitalised and expanded community dental services and address dental workforce shortages by increasing the number of dental undergraduates and expanding the role and number of professionals complementary to dentistry by ensuring adequate funding to remunerate all staff engaged in the delivery of dental services.&rdquo;</p>
         <p><strong> * S2M-2547.1 Peter Peacock:Early Years Education and Childcare&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2547) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &ldquo;notes&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s aim to provide more flexible and available childcare to all; acknowledges the significant successes already achieved through the Scottish Childcare Strategy, including making available free part-time pre-school education for every three and four-year-old, establishing a coherent regulatory framework under the Care Commission and expanding childcare provision across all sectors, and endorses the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to universal early education and childcare services with specific support to disadvantaged groups, including those for whom lack of childcare is a barrier to employment, education or training.&rdquo;</p>

         <p><strong> * S2M-2547.3 Ms Rosemary Byrne:Early Years Education and Childcare&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2547) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &ldquo;in particular&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;; calls for a recognition of the professionalism of nursery nurses and the immediate establishment of national pay and conditions commensurate with that professionalism; further calls for an immediate response from the Minister for Education and Young People regarding the delay in the publication of the national strategy for early years; demands a system of accessible childcare and nursery education publicly-funded and free at the point of need for all families; supports the wisdom of early intervention in the early stages of education and the implementation of developmental needs provision rather than formal learning, and calls for appropriate support for children with special educational needs and social, emotional and behavioural difficulties and also appropriate support for parents and carers of these children.&rdquo;</p>
