<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3891</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Granting of International Football Caps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that from the commencement of international football matches in 1872 through to 1975 the Scottish Football Association (SFA) awarded one&nbsp;cap per season, but only if the player faced England, Northern Ireland or Wales; further notes that from 1975 the SFA added all competitive internationals to this policy; recognises that from 1986 the criteria were changed so that a cap with the match details embroidered on it has been issued for each competitive international and a single seasonal cap, with only the year of the season on it, is issued if a player takes the &nbsp;field in a friendly match, even as a substitute; further recognises that the&nbsp;result of the original restrictive policy and its subsequent amendment is that some Scottish players who played in World Cup qualifying and finals matches of the 50s, 60s and 70s never received a cap because they did not play in the Home Internationals; notes that the 2005 William Hill Sports Book of the Year, <em>My Father and Other Working Class Heroes</em> by Gary Imlach, brought this injustice to light as it affected the author&rsquo;s father who played two matches in the World Cup in Sweden in 1958 but received no cap; believes that there are now players who have played briefly in a friendly and who have a cap and players who have played 90 minutes in a World Cup final who do not, such as Eddie Turnbull, with eight appearances against teams such as France and Yugoslavia, with no caps and Derek Riordan, with one friendly appearance and one cap, and also Scotland&rsquo;s most-capped player, Kenny Dalglish, with 102 appearances having less caps than Christian Dailly, with 60 appearances; further believes that the number of players or their descendants who would be entitled to a cap is 90 and that the estimated cost of providing a cap for each is &pound;2,000 in total, and considers that, as a declaration of thanks to those Scottish International players without caps and as a gesture of goodwill and encouragement to the game of football in Scotland, the SFA should issue a single commemorative cap to each of those players who do not have a cap to cover all the games that they may have played for their &nbsp;country.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3890&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>The Importance of Play</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes calls from Play Scotland and Barnardo&rsquo;s for a play strategy that recognises the right of all children in East Renfrewshire and across Scotland to a safe, challenging and accessible play environment; is aware of the public and political concerns over levels of obesity, mental health problems and anti-social behaviour amongst children and young people; notes that lack of opportunity to play is a contributing factor to these problems; is concerned that traffic growth, loss of open space and fears over safety are further restricting play opportunities, and therefore believes that play should be supported with a vigour that reflects its importance.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3889</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Sale of BB Guns at Markets</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the market organisers, Spook, to adopt a new policy that no BB guns or similar articles may be sold at any of their sites in Scotland, following a joint police/trading standards visit to the market at Bonnyrigg and discussions with organisers, and considers this an excellent move given a recent incident when two armed police response units attended a call reported as a man with a handgun, only to find it was a BB gun.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3888</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen&rsquo;s Eroding Golden Sands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the Scottish Executive for rejecting a &pound;10 million sea defence scheme for Aberdeen and replacing it with a &pound;2.57 million plan and believes that the Executive should rethink its decision on this issue in order that Aberdeen can continue to be known as the silver city with the golden sands, rather than as the granite city with the boulder-strewn beach.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3887</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Inclusion and Support of Young People with Learning Disabilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the efforts of the Scottish Executive to enable the inclusion of young people with learning disabilities in mainstream education where it is appropriate to do so; believes that the transitions from school to further education and from further education to employment are still difficult; considers that the Executive needs to ensure a better focus at these times so that it can improve the opportunities and choices of young people with learning disabilities, and notes that continuing efforts need to be made to further ensure inclusion within the community.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3886</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Encouraging Sport for Young People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that it is essential for the Scottish Executive to provide opportunities for children to become more active and lead healthier lives; recognises that considerable effort has gone into ensuring a level of physical activity in schools; notes, however, that improvements can still be made, particularly in primary schools, and urges the Executive to develop sporting opportunities in local communities in partnership with sports organisations, such as football clubs, in order to maximise the provision of community facilities and share the wealth of experience available in local areas.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3885#</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> <strong>Ellon Moves Towards Fairtrade Town Status</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Ellon Fairtrade Town steering group on the progress it is making towards meeting the criteria, assessed by the Fairtrade Foundation, which will allow Ellon to achieve Fairtrade Town status; notes that the criteria include generating popular support and media attention, securing the support of the local council and having fairly traded goods available in local shops and being used in local food outlets and workplaces; commends those already participating and contributing, and looks forward to a successful conclusion which will recognise a community working well together but, more importantly, being aware of and helping many other communities across the world who benefit from being able to sell their goods in a fair marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3884</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Marine Renewables - Power and Opportunity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Carbon Trust on the publication of <em>Future Marine Energy</em>, a report on the potential for wave and tidal power in the United Kingdom; welcomes the conclusions of the report that these emerging renewable energy technologies have the potential to become cost-competitive and could meet up to 20% of current UK electricity demand; notes with interest that this is a similar proportion to that currently supplied by nuclear power; strongly supports the development of offshore renewable technologies and believes that these, combined with energy efficiency measures, will play an important part in Scotland&rsquo;s and the UK&rsquo;s energy future, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use its existing powers to support the development of Scotland&rsquo;s marine renewable industry, enabling this country to fulfil its potential to lead the world in wave and tidal power.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3883</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Creative Scotland in Renfrewshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent announcement by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport on the planned merger of the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen to form Creative Scotland; calls on the Minister to consider situating this body outside Edinburgh, as was suggested in <em>The Herald</em> on 21 January 2006; notes that this practice has already happened with the location of the National Theatre of Scotland in Easterhouse rather than Edinburgh; further calls on the Minister to consider locations in the West of Scotland region, which has contributed to Scotland&rsquo;s cultural life, and notes the particular cultural history of Renfrewshire, which has produced many excellent participants in Scottish cultural society, including Robert Tannahill, Fulton Mackay, John Byrne, Gerry Rafferty, Carol Laula, Tom Conti, Christopher Brookmyre, Carol Smillie, Alexander Stoddart, and most recently, David Tennant.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3882#</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Banffshire Partnership and Buchan Dial-a-Community Bus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Banffshire Partnership and the Buchan Dial-a-Community Bus, who provide an essential transport service in areas with virtually no public transport; notes that transport problems faced by many people in rural communities lead to many forms of exclusion; further notes that at present the national concessionary travel scheme does not encompass transport outwith conventional services, and hopes that the formation of Transport Scotland will enable new ideas to be implemented to tackle the problem of rural transport.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3881</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>No Cover Up On CIA Rendition Flights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Swiss Senator, Dick Marty&rsquo;s, interim report on his continuing investigation into alleged secret detention centres and the use of airports and airspace within Council of Europe member states to assist the US Government&rsquo;s policy of extraordinary rendition; notes the Italian judicial investigation into an illegal abduction in the streets of Milan and the subsequent issuing of arrest warrants for 22 American agents as part of the judicial proceedings; notes that, despite Senator Marty&rsquo;s Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights having written to member states asking for information concerning the use of their airports for CIA flights, the biggest problem for the committee has been the lack of information provided so far and the lack of co-operation from those governments; calls on member states to provide the information by the stated deadline of 21 February 2006; further notes that the Polish Government ordered an inquiry into the alleged existence of CIA detention centres in Poland, but that the findings have not been published nor provided to the committee; suggests that the real question that Senator Marty&rsquo;s report raises is what information is being hidden and by whom; believes that, if such flights were using airports in Scotland and across Europe for trafficking illegal immigrants, Colombian drugs barons or parcels of cocaine, governments would not be experiencing the same problems in obtaining information, and calls on all governments across Europe to co-operate with Senator Marty and his investigation.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3880</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Food Production for Communities not for Profit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing stress endured by many in the dairy and wider farming community; further notes that this stress is a direct result of the current free market economic policy in world food production, which is based on profit rather than on promoting locally grown food, and calls on the Scottish Executive to promote Scottish farming in an environmentally, economically and socially just manner under the control of the workers, based on the needs of Scotland&rsquo;s communities rather than the profits of big business.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3879</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Olympic Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the call by the Danish Minister for Culture, Brian Mikkelsen, for Denmark&rsquo;s devolved territories to have their own Olympic teams; notes his comments that &quot;it won&rsquo;t be easy, but it has been possible for other home rule territories to become independent members of the IOC&quot;; contrasts his actions with those of ministers in Whitehall and in Edinburgh, and calls on the Scottish Executive to back the forming of a Scottish Olympic team in time for the 2012 Olympics in London.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3878</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Save the UK Theme and Keep the British in BBC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that in 1973 the BBC began to mark the handover from the World Service to Radio 4 at 5.30 am with a fantasia of British folk tunes called UK Theme which combines Early One Morning, Londonderry Air, Annie Laurie, What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor?, Greensleeves, Men of Harlech, Scotland the Brave, Trumpet Voluntary and Rule Britannia; notes that it was composed by Fritz Spiegl, an Austrian refugee, who, escaping Nazi oppression, arrived in Britain in 1939 aged 15 and, although unable to speak English or play a musical instrument, went on to become a successful musician and composer; further notes that BBC Radio 4 controller, Mark Damazer, has decided that from April the tune should be dropped in favour of an additional &quot;pacy&quot; news bulletin before the full news programme that commences at 6.00 am; regrets this decision and considers it to be a further step by the BBC to remove visual and aural icons of Britain from the British Broadcasting Corporation; supports the retention of the UK Theme as marking the beginning of Radio 4 broadcasts, and believes that the BBC should reverse the decision and remember that it is a British institution funded by British licence payers.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3877#</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Air Ambulance Trials in Orkney</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposal of the Scottish Ambulance Service to replace the Kirkwall-based BN Islander aircraft, successfully used for many years to provide air ambulance cover for Orkney, with an Inverness-based EC 135 helicopter which also covers a much wider area of the Highlands and Islands and beyond; further notes that trials of the helicopter on service in Orkney, carried out since spring 2005, have done little to provide assurances that it can provide even an equal level of service to that provided by the Islander aircraft, with particular concerns relating to its ability to fly in Orkney&rsquo;s winter weather and also its ability to provide adequate cover for the wide area it will be required to serve, and believes that, if the Kirkwall-based Islander aircraft is not retained as a back-up facility beyond the end of March 2006, Orkney will be left with poorer quality and potentially unsafe air ambulance cover.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3876&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Treatment in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the most recent guidance issued by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), which recommends the use of the drugs donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine for use in the treatment of people with moderate Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in England and Wales; whilst welcoming this decision, regrets that no similar commitment has been made in respect of the availability of such drugs for people diagnosed with mild Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; is disappointed that memantine has not been recommended for use at all, despite clinical evidence to suggest that it can benefit patients who have reached the severe stages of the disease; recognises the benefits of continued therapeutic and specialist nursing care in assisting Alzheimer&rsquo;s sufferers to manage their condition; agrees that initiatives such as that implemented recently by NHS Ayrshire and Arran, whereby at least two nurses on all acute wards are trained specifically to manage patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, are an effective means of aiding sufferers and their families; but believes, nonethelesss, that donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine should be available to sufferers of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in Scotland; is aware that NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) will now take the final decision on whether to allow these drugs to be prescribed in Scotland and therefore urges QIS to go further than the NICE recommendations and recognise the role and experience of clinicians and GPs in assessing the needs of the estimated 62,000 people in Scotland who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and calls for a degree of flexibility and discretion to be available to such practitioners in the prescribing of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine, dependent on their evaluation of individual cases.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3875</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with the PCS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends solidarity greetings to members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union taking strike action in defence of public services, their jobs and to resist privatisation; recognises that 15,000 jobs in the Department of Work and Pensions have already been eroded, leading to one million calls for help, with benefits going unanswered, eight-week delays for vulnerable people entitled to benefits, pensioners and those most in need not being able to travel required distances to centralised offices and frustration and anger compromising the health and safety of workers; commends the PCS for its constructive attempts to negotiate a solution; recognises that members have no alternative but to strike; believes their employers, the UK Government, should seek meaningful talks and take action to reverse the cuts, centralisation and privatisation, and, until that happens, wishes every success to the members of the PCS in their action.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3873</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Tinnitus Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the British Tinnitus Association and the RNID for working together to organise National Tinnitus Week from 20 to 26 February 2006 to raise public awareness of tinnitus, make people with tinnitus aware of the assistance available at hospitals around the United Kingdom, encourage more sufferers to seek help, bring the condition to the attention of those at risk of tinnitus and help to ensure that more GPs are informed about the services and information available to them and their patients.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3872</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes:</strong> <strong>Local Government Pension Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned with the recent decision to abolish the Rule of 85 for members of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) in Scotland; recognises that this will have a detrimental impact on the many public sector workers to whom membership of the LGPS is open, including local government staff, police support staff, higher and further education staff and staff within the community and voluntary sector; notes that such a decision means that LGPS members are denied the same rights and protections as members of other public sector pension schemes which have agreed to allow retirement at the age of 60 on a full pension; recognises that members of the LGPS contribute to the scheme and want to ensure that there is a viable and sustainable future for it; notes that the correct manner for dealing with changes to the LGPS, or any disagreement on legal opinion in respect of it, is through open and fair discussion with staff and their trade unions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to initiate urgent discussions with COSLA and the relevant trade unions to achieve a solution agreeable to all.</p>

<p>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3867</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Broadcasting the Bard</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the fact that BBC Scotland has only two programmes focusing on the work of Robert Burns planned across its television and radio output for Burns Night, one on Radio Scotland and the other on BBC1, while Radio 3 has a single late-night offering from the Celtic Connections Festival and Scottish, Grampian and Border TV have no programmes planned at all; considers this to be a gross under-representation of the undisputable talent and enduring popularity of Burns, and calls on Scottish broadcasters to devote greater efforts to producing appropriate programmes for Burns Night next year.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3866</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Replacement of Trident</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the United Kingdom should not seek to replace the Trident nuclear missile system;&nbsp;notes that in 2005 the UK Government reaffirmed its commitment to all its obligations under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 1967 (NPT), including its legally binding obligation to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good faith;&nbsp;agrees with the legal opinion of Rabinder Singh QC and Professor Christine Chinkin of Matrix Chambers on 19 December 2005 that any replacement of the Trident system would constitute a material breach of Article VI of the NPT, and calls on the Scottish Executive to seek an early assurance from the UK Government that it will fully comply with our legal obligations in respect of the NPT and that it will not seek to replace the Trident nuclear missile system with another weapon system of mass destruction.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3861</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Renewable Energy Opportunity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the findings of new research by Dr Shimon Awerbuch of the University of Sussex which shows that increasing the proportion of Scotland&rsquo;s electricity generated from wind would mean an overall reduction in Scotland&rsquo;s future electricity costs; notes that such an increase in wind electricity generation will not only reduce overall costs but will improve the security of Scotland&rsquo;s electricity supply, and calls on the Scottish Executive to consider revising upwards its current targets for renewable energy to take advantage of the findings of this research.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3860</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Keeping Children Safe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, while recognising the importance of the sex offenders&rsquo; register and the Disqualified from Working with Children List, accepts that most abused children are abused by someone from within their immediate circle and not by strangers; believes that an approach to child protection that relies on procedures, lists and rigid rules will not keep many of our nation&rsquo;s children safe but that society at large has a responsibility and a duty to protect the nation&rsquo;s children; further believes that the criteria and the process for inclusion on the sex offenders&rsquo; register should be reconsidered, noting that Children 1st specifically recommends that not all people on this register should automatically be disqualified from working with children and that the criteria for so banning someone should be in the public domain to increase confidence in the child protection system, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to review the operation of both registers, while being mindful that it is not stranger danger but familiar faces which pose most risk to children, and to instigate a public awareness campaign to this end.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3858</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Support for Sacked Worker</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the chain store firm, Dunnes Stores, which has outlets throughout Scotland, has achieved a new low in European industrial relations by sacking shop steward, Joanne Delaney; notes that 22-year-old Ms Delaney was elected shop steward by her fellow members in the Ashleaf store in Crumlin, Dublin, after four years&rsquo; service with the firm, but was sacked shortly afterwards for wearing her Mandate trade union badge on her store uniform; further notes that Dunnes then compounded its anti-trade union stance by refusing to attend a meeting about the disciplinary action with Ms Delaney because she was accompanied by her trade union official; utterly condemns Dunnes&rsquo; behaviour towards Ms Delaney, believing that it directly contravenes her basic human rights of freedom of association and belief, and urges the firm to reinstate her forthwith.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-3857</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Rendition Flights to Wick and Inverness Airports?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the disclosure of documents, obtained by Amnesty International from the US Federal Aviation Administration and separately by the Danish Government, has revealed <em>inter alia </em>that seven alleged rendition flights operated by the CIA have been made through two Highlands airports, two at Wick and five at Inverness; further notes that following these reports the Danish Government announced on 22 August 2005 that the CIA could no longer use Danish airspace; recognises that both Wick and Inverness airports are operated by Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (HIAL), a company wholly owned by the Scottish Executive with the Scottish Ministers the sole shareholder, represented by the Minister for Transport, at one time the current Deputy First Minister, Nicol Stephen, and currently Tavish Scott MSP, and, given that ministerial relationship, calls on the Scottish Ministers to use their powers to instigate a full and thorough investigation to determine what associated documentation HIAL may, or may not, have in respect of these alleged flights.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3839#</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Welsh:</strong> <strong>Community and Village Halls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the increased costs of water charges paid by new village and community halls and that these will also be imposed on older halls after 2010; recognises that these halls play a vital role as the hub of the community by providing a venue for educational classes, Scottish dancing, recreation, Scottish Women&rsquo;s Rural Institute meetings, keep-fit classes, youth clubs, scouts, brownies and other activities; believes that these charges to charitable organisations are an undue burden on local rural communities in Angus; notes that the Scottish Executive has partly funded numerous new halls and refurbishments for many more which has caused an increase in the rateable value burden, and believes that the Executive should extend the exemption scheme to all community and village halls with charitable status and introduce legislation to reinstate the exemption for community and village halls which have charitable status.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3732#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Childhood Obesity in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at recent findings published by NHS Scotland which suggest that the proportion of Scottish children who are overweight, obese and severely obese is far higher than anticipated in all age groups and is twice that of the expected UK average; recognises this means that more than a third of our 12-year-olds were considered to be overweight last year, 19.4% were considered to be obese and 11.2% severely obese; accepts that these figures represent a potential time bomb for the NHS in terms of the future costs of the treatment of obesity and related illness; acknowledges the commitment by the Scottish Executive to tackle this problem; considers that more robust measures are needed, such as investing further in the promotion of breastfeeding as the healthiest start in life, removing unhealthy dietary choices from our school environments and increasing the focus and commitment to physical activity in our schools; acknowledges that examples of best practice exist, such as South Coatbridge&rsquo;s Healthy Lifestyle Project, and believes that, in light of these findings, a national debate is needed to re-examine all possible options and means of making progress on this issue.</p>
