<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6438 George Foulkes: Congratulations to Broxburn Athletic FC on Title Win</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Broxburn Athletic FC, the club&rsquo;s management, officials and supporters on winning the 2010 Scottish Junior Football East Region League South Division Title and securing promotion to the East Region Premier Division; notes that the club has lifted three league championships in the last six years, and wishes Broxburn Athletic every success in the Premier Division in the coming season when they will return to play home matches at their newly refurbished Albyn Park in Broxburn.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6437&diams;   Christina McKelvie: My Hero, My Soldier Laddie, Commemorating Scotland&rsquo;s VC Recipients</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>My Hero, My Soldier Laddie</em> by artist and writer Duncan Brown, the illustrated story of Scotland&rsquo;s 172 recipients of the Victoria Cross (VC); notes that the book tells the individual stories of each of the 14 VC recipients who came from Lanarkshire, one in every hundred of all VC recipients ever awarded; further notes that, in 2001, Duncan Brown was instrumental in securing the raising of the monument that now stands in Hamilton Town Square to the memory of these 14 men, David Mackay of Auchenheath, Frederick Aikman and John O&rsquo;Neill of Hamilton, William Gardner of Bothwell, Willie Angus, Thomas Caldwell and Donald Cameron of Carluke, David Lauder and John Carmichael of Airdrie, James Richardson of Bellshill, William Milne of Wishaw, John Hamilton of Cambuslang, William Clamp of Craigneuk and Bill Reid of Coatbridge; believes that the type of oral and social history found in <em>My Hero, My Soldier Laddie</em> plays a crucial role in uncovering, illuminating and preserving Scotland&rsquo;s past and the lives of ordinary Scots who made extraordinary contributions, and congratulates Duncan Brown on his considerable achievement in this respect.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6436 Iain Smith: Report on Banking and Financial Services in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee&rsquo;s 3rd Report 2010 (Session 3): <em>Report on the way forward for Scotland&rsquo;s banking, building society and financial services sector</em> (SP Paper 405).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6435 Jim Hume: Protecting Vital GP Dispensing Practices</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the important role of dispensing GP practices in remote and rural communities across the South of Scotland; acknowledges the high level of patient satisfaction with these practices; is concerned about the threat posed by unrestricted commercial pharmacy applications to the sustainability of health services provided by dispensing GP practices; is aware of the current consultation on the control of entry arrangements relating to NHS pharmaceutical services; supports the implementation of new improved regulations in which a first stage or pre-application process is used to eliminate speculative applications, repeat applications where no significant change in circumstances has occurred and substantially inaccurate applications, and further supports the provision of local, holistic health services whereby health care professionals work together to plan and deliver more flexible services.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6086# Bill Butler: Bank on Owen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Bank on Owen campaign, which aims to have Robert Owen of New Lanark commemorated on Scottish bank notes to mark the International Year of Cooperatives in 2012; recognises the contribution that Robert Owen made to Scottish society through his pioneering work at New Lanark where he championed co-operative principles and values; notes that the co-operative sector in Scotland is worth over &pound;3 billion to the economy and that the co-operative business model has proven extremely resilient and reliable during the recent global economic upheaval, and would welcome widespread support for this proposal.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-5940# Stuart McMillan: World Oceans Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises World Oceans Day 2010 on 8 June and congratulates the United Nations for designating a day with the aim of improving the health of the world&rsquo;s oceans; considers that lobbying by the Ocean Project and the World Ocean Network encouraged the UN to officially recognise 8 June as World Oceans Day; acknowledges that there will be events to mark the date across the world and hopes that communities across Scotland may take part or organise their own events; further considers that the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, Scotland&rsquo;s first such Act, goes a long way in improving awareness and responsibility for the sustainability of Scotland&rsquo;s seas and hopes that the events on 8 June will take up this message; hopes that the theme of the day, Our Oceans, Our Responsibility<em>, </em>will be widely spread, and wishes World Oceans Day much success in future years.</p>
