          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-752</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Draft Scottish Hospital Trust (Transfer of Property) Regulations 2004</strong>-That the Health Committee recommends that the draft Scottish Hospital Trust (Transfer of Property) Regulations 2004 be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-751</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>The Draft Solvent Emissions (Scotland) Regulations 2004</strong>-That the Environment and Rural Development Committee recommends that the draft Solvent Emissions (Scotland) Regulations 2004 be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-750</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Flow Country</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the Flow Country constitutes the biggest blanket bog in the world; remembers that significant damage has been done to it, including afforestation at taxpayers' expense, in the past; commends the partners in the Life Peatlands Project for their work on its ecological restoration; notes that bog restoration could reduce Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions by up to 10%, and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that this national treasure is given the highest possible protection and is reconsidered for nomination to UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-749</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Hearts FC Relocation from Tynecastle Stadium</strong>-That the Parliament notes the Heart of Midlothian Football Club board's intention to move from Tynecastle at the end of this season, set out in its document <em>Tynecastle Stadium: Not Fit for the Purpose</em>; further notes that two stated reasons for moving are UEFA restrictions on pitch size and planning restrictions on rebuilding the McLeod Street stand; further notes previous comments of the Scottish Football Association and UEFA that at present no one can state categorically that Tynecastle will be banned from hosting UEFA matches; agrees with the Federation of Hearts Supporters that a move from Tynecastle may be necessary if planning restrictions will prevent redevelopment of the McLeod Street stand; believes, nonetheless, that the Hearts FC board must actually prove and not merely predict that this is the case; believes that football clubs help sustain the community in which they are rooted and therefore welcomes the intention of Hibernian FC to remain at Easter Road, and calls on the Hearts FC board to pursue the option of remaining at Tynecastle in a transparent manner and to view the option of a move to Murrayfield or other venue only as a last resort.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-702#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Closure of Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the decision of Stirling Council's ruling Labour administration to close Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School in the top of the town area of the city; notes that the council has failed to listen to the wishes of parents, the local community and those involved in the school as recorded in its report on its own consultation exercise; believes that Stirling Council has therefore failed to make an adequate case for the closure of the school, and further believes that the Scottish Executive should use its powers over the closure of denominational schools to ask the council to find a way to keep the school open.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-474#</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>Horse Racing Industry in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the significant contribution that the horse racing industry makes to the economy, generating up to &pound;125 million annually and providing the equivalent of 1,700 full-time jobs; commends the success of the racing industry in continuing to expand and develop, recognising its contribution to local economies and tourism; notes that there is widespread concern regarding the potential implications of the proposed Office of Fair Trading (OFT) rule 14 notice on the deregulation of the British horse racing industry and, in particular, on its likely impact on Scotland's five racecourses, Ayr, Hamilton Park, Kelso, Musselburgh and Perth, each of which is independently owned and managed with profits generated ploughed back into the sport for long-term growth, and considers that the Scottish Executive should work with representatives of the racing industry to identify opportunities to promote and develop the industry and to explore the possible implications of the OFT ruling.</P>
