<STRONG>Mr Lloyd Quinan: Autism Services for Adults</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
recognises, in the light of the inquiry into the suicide and unlawful killing 
of a single mother and her 11-year-old autistic son in County Durham last year, 
that there is a desperate need for improved and integrated services for adolescents 
with an autistic spectrum disorder and their families; further recognises that 
parents are anxious about the future as they age and as the necessary services 
do not exist to replace their care of their children; notes that there is now 
a far greater number of adults with autistic spectrum disorders than there are 
children, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to take action to challenge the 
misconception that autism is a condition that only affects children by providing 
necessary and much-needed health, educational and employment services to ensure 
these people are able to reach their potential in adulthood.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3466</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Ms Margo MacDonald: The Holyrood Project</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
recognises the importance of the Holyrood Project to the electorate&#146;s confidence 
in the ability of the Scottish Parliament to administer policy and manage public 
finances and resolves to fully inform people of the circumstances which have led 
to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body seeking an extra £28.2 million funding 
in addition to the estimated project cost intimated in March 2002.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3465</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Bristow Muldoon: Transport and the Environment Committee, Report on Petition 
PE327 by the Blairingone and Saline Action Group on Organic Waste Spread on Land 
</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 4th Report 2002 of the Transport 
and the Environment Committee, <em>Report on Petition PE327 by the Blairingone 
and Saline Action Group on Organic Waste Spread on Land</em> (SP Paper 528).</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3464#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Donald Gorrie: Debt and Lending</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned 
by the number of households badly affected by debt and by the contribution to 
debt problems made by banks, retailers issuing credit cards, building societies 
and money lenders vigorously encouraging people to borrow more money, when they 
are already heavily in debt or obviously have no means of repaying the loan, and 
as regulation in this sphere is outwith the powers of the Parliament, believes 
that the Scottish Executive should address this issue by means of holding discussions 
with these lending bodies to seek voluntary agreements that they will not advertise 
or press credit on people that are manifestly not creditworthy and should ask 
the banks instead to lend money to credit unions for them to lend to people of 
limited means on the basis of such unions&#146; better assessment of the likelihood 
of each loan.</P><P>Supported by: Robert Brown, Nora Radcliffe, George Lyon, Tavish 
Scott, Robin Harper</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3463</STRONG> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie: Redundancy 
Insurance</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament, in light of the experience of the 
Citizens Advice Bureaux in giving advice to people that become unemployed, urges 
insurance companies to make much clearer the limit and extent of cover, in relation 
to credit and debt issues, given by their policies guarding people against redundancy 
and to highlight the limit and extent of such cover in the relevant proposal forms 
and related literature.</P><P>Supported by: Robert Brown, Nora Radcliffe, George 
Lyon, Tavish Scott, Robin Harper, Shona Robison<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3462</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Sweet Sixteen</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
the team responsible for the film Sweet Sixteen which was made and premiered in 
Greenock and won the best script award at the Cannes Film Festival; notes with 
concern the decision of the British Board of Film Classification to give the film 
an &quot;18&quot; rating meaning that many of the young actors who made the film 
would not be allowed to view it; believes that this is clearly absurd and that, 
further, the decisions on what Scots see in the cinema should be decided in Scotland, 
and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s 
Government to devolve decisions on censorship to Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3461</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Adam: Grampian Addiction Problem Service (GAPS)</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament acknowledges the great contribution made by the Grampian Addiction 
Problem Service (GAPS) and, in particular, the efforts of Janice Jess in helping 
addicts and their families in the north-east of Scotland and calls on the Scottish 
Executive to place a duty on health authorities and local authorities to support 
and encourage community-based groups such as GAPS.</P><P>Supported by: Stewart 
Stevenson<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Shona Robison<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3460 
Mr Murray Tosh on behalf of the Procedures Committee: Standards Commissioner - 
Procedures Committee's 4th Report 2002</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament agrees 
the recommendations for changes to the Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament 
concerning the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner contained in the 
Procedures Committee&#146;s 4th Report 2002, <em>Changes to Standing Orders concerning 
the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, European Committee remit, Private 
Legislation, Temporary Conveners and the Journal of the Scottish Parliament </em>(SP 
Paper 665), and that agrees that these changes shall come into effect on 14 October 
2002. </P><P>Supported by: Mr Kenneth Macintosh</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3459#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Elaine Thomson: Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament welcomes the work of the Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group and the recent 
adoption of their action plan by Aberdeen City Council as providing a way forward 
for Aberdeen and the north-east; believes that the adoption of the plan will be 
to the benefit of Scotland&#146;s economy given the area&#146;s existing skills 
and intellectual capital in the Scottish oil and gas industry; notes Aberdeen&#146;s 
international position as the energy capital of Europe; recognises the immense 
opportunities offered by the development of an indigenous Scottish renewable industry 
to exploit Scotland&#146;s unrivalled renewable energy resources, particularly 
in the north of Scotland, and further notes the opportunities for the export of 
renewable technologies and expertise.</P><P>Supported by: Maureen Macmillan, Rhoda 
Grant, Tavish Scott, Cathy Peattie, Mr Jamie Stone, Dr Sylvia Jackson, Helen Eadie, 
Robin Harper, Brian Adam, Richard Lochhead, Shona Robison<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>S1M-3458#</STRONG> <STRONG>Margaret Smith: Draft West Edinburgh Planning 
Framework</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the recent publication of 
the draft West Edinburgh Planning Framework and recognises west Edinburgh&#146;s 
significant contribution to Scotland&#146;s economy, transport and environment.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3457</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: The Complete Songs of Robert Burns</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates Dr Fred Freeman of the University of Edinburgh and 
Ivor Tiefenbrun of Linn Records on successfully completing the seven-and-a-half-year 
project to produce the only complete recordings of the songs of Robert Burns; 
recognises that the cultural, social and political significance of this project 
is far reaching, the approach to Burns and to his music is unique, setting him 
in a context which links together each region of the country and Scotland with 
Europe and the world, and wishes every good fortune in sales of the recordings 
to the public, local libraries and Burns societies.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Keith 
Harding, Murdo Fraser</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3456</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: Building 
(Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament, for the 
purposes of any Act of the Parliament resulting from the Building (Scotland) Bill, 
agrees to&#151;</P><P></P><DIR> <DIR> <P>(a) any increase in expenditure payable 
out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act, and</P><P></P><P>(b) 
any charge imposed, and any payment required to be made, by or under the Act.</P></DIR></DIR><P><STRONG>S1M-3454#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Science and the Parliament - Wednesday 6 November 2002</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the "Science and the Parliament" event being held on Wednesday 
6 November 2002, organised by the Royal Society of Chemistry in association with 
Scotland's leading science organisations; notes the contribution of Scotland's 
40,000 scientists to our economic, environmental and social development; further 
notes that Scotland is a world leader in many scientific disciplines; congratulates 
Scotland's scientists for their excellent ratings in the 2001 Research Assessment 
Exercise; welcomes the Scottish Executive's science strategy set out in <em>A Science 
Strategy for Scotland </em>and the efforts to foster an environment which enhances 
student participation in science, to invest in the science infrastructure and 
equipment of our educational establishments, to increase investment in research 
along with supporting greater industrial research and assisting in the practical 
application of our world beating research, and believes that the Executive should 
take measures to reverse the downward trend and ensure that more students are 
choosing to study science at higher grade and degree level.</P><P>Supported by: 
Mr Jamie Stone, Shona Robison<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3453</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Iain Smith: 10th Anniversary of Voluntary Organisations North East Fife</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates Voluntary Organisations North East Fife (VONEF) on 
its 10th Anniversary; recognises the valuable contribution VONEF has made to voluntary 
and community groups and individuals throughout north-east Fife, in particular 
its success in attracting funding support, and wishes VONEF continued success 
for the future.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone, Mr Keith Harding</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3449</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Fiona Hyslop: Disabled Persons Housing Service (Lothian)</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with serious concern that the Disabled Persons Housing Service 
(Lothian) (DPHS) has announced that it will need to close on 31 December 2002 
owing to a lack of financial support from City of Edinburgh Council; notes that 
this service is internationally renowned; recalls that cross-party support was 
expressed for DPHS, including the support of ministers, and therefore urges the 
Scottish Executive to consider securing properly the future funding of DPHS and 
extending the service to other areas of the country in order to ensure that strategies 
to improve equality can help deliver services to those that need them.</P><P>Supported 
by: Linda Fabiani, Stewart Stevenson, Michael Matheson, Robert Brown</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3448</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Death of Yoni Jesner</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
expresses horror at the death of 19-year-old Yoni Jesner from Giffnock in East 
Renfrewshire at the hands of a suicide bomber in a public street in Tel Aviv on 
19 September 2002; acknowledges the impact of this atrocity on the Jewish community 
here in Scotland; believes there can be no justification for such an appalling 
act; wishes to express its sympathy to Yoni's family and friends; is greatly moved 
by the donation of Yoni's kidneys and other organs, which have been used to save 
the life of a young Palestinian child, and believes that such a practical and 
symbolic gesture demonstrates the power of tolerance, friendship and common humanity 
over hate and violence.</P><P>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Margaret Jamieson, 
David Mundell, Nora Radcliffe, Fiona McLeod, Mr Alasdair Morrison, Mr Murray Tosh, 
Mr John Home Robertson, Murdo Fraser, John Young, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, 
Robert Brown, Michael Russell, Mr Jamie Stone, Bill Aitken, Mr Andrew Welsh, Phil 
Gallie, Mr Tom McCabe, Karen Gillon, Mr Brian Monteith, Trish Godman, Des McNulty,

<STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Inquiry Into Glasgow Housing Stock Transfer</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes that, since the ballot to transfer Glasgow&#146;s housing 
stock, the entire process has been fraught with lengthy delays and constant changes 
to the business plan and that significant sums of money have been spent on consultants 
rather than repairing homes in Glasgow for over two years; further notes with 
concern that, in this period, many Glasgow tenants have had minimal repairs carried 
out and continue to live in houses in serious disrepair, that the timetable for 
carrying out repairs given to tenants prior to the ballot is now unachievable 
and that consultants report that the financial costs of the scheme have been seriously 
underestimated; recognises that a crisis of tenant participation in local housing 
associations has developed, totally undermining the supposed central objective 
of the transfer process, namely improved tenant involvement and participation 
in managing housing stock; further recognises that recent events conclusively 
prove that the large scale housing stock transfer model is an expensive and complex 
mechanism for improving housing stock; believes that the Scottish Executive should 
recognise that the promises made to tenants prior to the ballot have not been 
carried out, with Glasgow tenants still suffering from sub-standard housing, and 
considers that the Executive should urgently hold a full inquiry into this gross 
misuse of public money.</P><P>Supported by: Michael Matheson, Alex Neil, Christine 
Grahame, Mr Kenneth Gibson, Fiona Hyslop, Mr Gil Paterson, Brian Adam</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3446</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: Mental Health (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting 
from the Mental Health (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure payable out 
of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3445</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Irene McGugan: Chris Hoy Track Cycling Success</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament congratulates Scottish cyclist Chris Hoy on winning gold in the Men&#146;s 
1 km time trial at the Track Cycling World Championships, held in Copenhagen between 
25 and 29 September 2002; further congratulates Chris Hoy on adding this significant 
and well-deserved success to his Commonwealth Games title won in Manchester in 
August 2002; regrets that Chris Hoy, along with other professional Scottish cyclists, 
is forced to further his cycling career away from Scotland owing to the lack of 
an adequate all-weather facility at the Meadowbank velodrome in Edinburgh, currently 
the only velodrome in Scotland; supports the urgent need to provide such all-weather 
sporting facilities for both "elite" cyclists and others interested in pursuing 
a healthy and active lifestyle, many of whom are young people and children, and 
urges the Scottish Executive and <STRONG>sport</STRONG>scotland to provide the 
funding necessary to the creation of these facilities.</P><P>Supported by: Michael 
Matheson, Alex Johnstone, Mr Brian Monteith, Phil Gallie, Mr Keith Harding, Shona 
Robison<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>S1M-3444</STRONG> <STRONG>David Mundell: 
Integrated NHS in Dumfries and Galloway</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
that there is not a &quot;one size fits all&quot; model for the organisation of 
the NHS in Scotland; welcomes the decision by the Minister for Health and Community 
Care to approve the plans by Dumfries and Galloway NHS Board for the integration 
of the three health organisations in Dumfries and Galloway which have received 
widespread staff and public support, and looks forward to a smooth transition 
to the new single organisation, which has many challenges to meet in delivering 
the best possible health services to people living throughout the many communities 
in Dumfries and Galloway, not least the retention and recruitment of staff.</P><P>Supported 
by: Alex Fergusson, Mary Scanlon</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3443</STRONG> <STRONG>Iain 
Smith: Fife Rail Services</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the amended 
rail services in Fife introduced by the 2002-03 winter timetable; welcomes, in 
particular, the new 06:00 service from Dundee to Edinburgh and 18:42 service from 
Edinburgh to Dundee, operated by Virgin Trains, which will help to increase travel 
opportunities and reduce overcrowding for passengers from north-east Fife, and 
calls on the train operating companies to continue to improve the rail service 
in Fife and, in particular, on ScotRail to restore the stop at Ladybank on the 
08:49 service from Perth to Edinburgh.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3442*#*</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh: Rise in Suicide Rates</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes with concern the rise in suicide rates and, in particular, the worrying 
rise in suicides amongst young people; commends the significant work that Facilitate 
(Scotland) has done in this area, providing counselling and support for those 
at risk from self-harm throughout Scotland and for their families, and notes that 
only strengthened communities and families will be able to support vulnerable 
people through personal crises, prevent those people from taking drastic action 
against themselves and enable them to regain control of their lives and their 
futures.</P><P>Supported by: Christine Grahame, Mr Jamie Stone, David McLetchie,

of the <em>Sunday Herald</em>, <em>The Herald</em> and the <em>Evening Times</em> to 
the Barclay brothers, current owners of <em>Scotland on Sunday</em>, <em>The Scotsman</em> 
and the <em>Edinburgh Evening News</em>, would be a completely unacceptable concentration

the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">notes the on-going competition to decide the 
United Kingdom&#146;s nominee for the European Capital of Culture in 2008; further 
notes that Inverness Highland 2008 is the sole Scottish bid; recognises the imaginative 
plans that the bid team have proposed including capitalising on the Highlands&#146; 
unique culture and the development of a cultural plan; further recognises the 
immense economic, social and cultural benefits that a successful bid would bring 
to Inverness and the Highlands, and considers that, as this is the sole Scottish 
bid, the Scottish Executive, MSPs, government agencies and the wider Scottish 
society should do all in their power to support the bid and promote a successful
