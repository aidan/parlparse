<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7979 Robert Brown: British Stammering Association</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the British Stammering Association Scotland (BSA Scotland), which seeks, among other things, to promote the successful self-management of stammering as a long-term condition; notes that the organisation is currently engaged in the delivery of a project funded by the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland, which focuses on giving support to new and existing self-management groups, using new technology and social media to reach those people who find it difficult to access those groups and developing a self-management toolkit for people who stammer; further notes that BSA Scotland recently held what was considered a very successful public awareness and engagement event, the Glasgow Open Day, and is now planning another similar event for Edinburgh; considers that the release of the film, <em>The King&rsquo;s Speech</em>, has created unprecedented interest in stammering and through its success with audiences, critics and awards-givers alike continues to draw attention to this complex, multifactorial and much-misunderstood communication disability; recognises that children, young people and adults who stammer will often experience bullying in education and discrimination in the workplace and, as such, will sometimes underachieve educationally, economically, socially and culturally, and supports the ongoing good work of the association in campaigning on behalf of and supporting people of all ages whose lives are affected by stammering.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7978 Nicola Sturgeon: Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Shona Robison<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7977&diams;   Mike Rumbles: Grampian Police</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern comments from the Chief Constable of Grampian Police, Colin McKerracher, that merging Scotland&rsquo;s police forces could lead to the loss of 4,000 police officers&rsquo; jobs, including up to 400 in Grampian; further notes Mr McKerracher&rsquo;s view that there is not a shred of evidence that a single force would be the best option; welcomes the vote by Northern Constabulary officers and staff to reject a single police force by 86.6%, and expresses its disappointment that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice has, it considers, undermined and pre-empted the current consultation on the issue by stating that a strong case had been made for a single force.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7976 Robert Brown: School Clothing Grant Report Axed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament appreciates what it sees as the considerable effort put into producing the report of the short-life working group on the review of school meal and school clothing grant provision across Scotland; is concerned that the final report was completed in March 2009 but not published until January 2011, some 22 months later; notes the main recommendations that the Scottish Government and COSLA should produce guidance for local authorities on the school clothing grant and that the minimum level should rise to &pound;70 per pupil per annum; notes further that councils are under a statutory duty in terms of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 to make clothing grant provision to eligible parents; is aware of the value of the grant to hard-pressed parents, and regrets that the Scottish Ministers appear to have pigeonholed the report without any proposals for present or future action on it.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7975 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Keep Edinburgh Tidy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh on being placed in the top 10 of an MSN Travel online poll of world cities judged to be spic and span; recognises that Edinburgh came first in the Keep Scotland Beautiful awards 2010, which takes into account the absence of litter and graffiti; considers that Scotland&rsquo;s capital has seen a dramatic rise in the number of volunteers taking part in organised litter picks, with the MSN poll citing 5,000 volunteers city wide; highlights the many events already planned for the Keep Scotland Beautiful National Spring Clean campaign, which takes place from Monday 14 March to Monday 16 May 2011; considers litter-picking events in Victoria Park in Leith, organised by Trinity Primary School, and in Hawthornvale Path by the Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop to be great examples of community action for cleaner streets and parks, and notes that information about events for the National Spring Clean campaign can be found at http://springclean.keepscotlandtidy.org.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7974 Patrick Harvie: Unacceptable Comments by the Convener of the Justice Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the attitude that it considers was shown by Bill Aitken MSP on the subject of rape during a recent interview with the <em>Sunday Herald</em> newspaper; considers that Mr Aitken&rsquo;s reported comments during the interview betray a disregard for the seriousness of rape and imply support for the view that a victim can be held responsible for this most vicious crime; believes that this view, though disturbingly widespread, is rooted in misogyny and ignorance; considers these comments to be incompatible with the role of Convener of the Justice Committee; believes that the Parliament&rsquo;s credibility to deal proactively with issues of sexual violence would be undermined if the proximity of dissolution resulted in failure to hold Mr Aitken to account for what it considers these odious and shocking comments, and calls for Mr Aitken&rsquo;s immediate resignation.</p>
<p>Supported by: Shirley-Anne Somerville<strong>*</strong>, Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7973 Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell: USA Veto UN Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deeply regrets the actions of the United States of America in using its veto to block a resolution of the United Nations (UN) condemning the ongoing building of illegal settlements by Israel in the West Bank and East Jerusalem; commends the 130 members of the UN who signed the resolution; believes that the actions of the USA are contrary to the rhetoric from the Obama administration in relation to events in Egypt and elsewhere, and that this exposes what it considers to be hypocrisy at the heart of the USA&rsquo;s foreign policy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7972 Linda Fabiani: John Mason, A Musical Legacy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its sadness at the death of John Mason, founder and musical director of the Scottish Fiddle Orchestra; considers that John was dedicated to his music and hisorchestraand,over-the-years,entertained many thousands of people while raising considerable sums for charity; further applauds his talent in writing and arranging many tunes that have become standards in the traditional music canon, and offers respect, sympathy and condolences to his family and many friends.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7971 Trish Godman: Quarriers 140 Years On</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2011 is the 140th anniversary of the creation of Quarriers Village in Renfrewshire by the Greenock-born Glasgow shoemaker, William Quarrier; considers that Quarriers as a community gave welcome sanctuary down the years to thousands of children rescued from the horrible slums of Glasgow and other children living in dire poverty and now, as the Scotland-based charity Quarriers, by way of its dedicated, professional employees, provides care and support for children and adults with numerous mental and physical ailments throughout Scotland and south of the border; offers sincere thanks and compliments to all at Quarriers, and hopes that what it considers their remarkable and compassionate service to those in need is given the recognition and financial support that they so manifestly deserve in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7970 Claire Baker: Care Home Provision in Fife</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at Fife Council&rsquo;s decision to withdraw funding for council-run care homes; considers that the proposals will lead to the closure of all local council-run care homes and notes that they are causing great concern among staff, care home users and their families; notes with surprise that Fife Council appears to have ignored the findings of its own public consultation on the issue, which supported the idea that the council remain a central provider of care in the region, and calls on Fife Council to re-assess its decision.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7964 Hugh Henry: Creative Scotland Expenditure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about recently published details of Creative Scotland expenditure; considers that, in a time of austerity, Creative Scotland should consider grant applications more carefully before making awards; expresses concern at and cannot understand the justification for &pound;58,000 of taxpayers&rsquo; money being used to fund a dance programme based on the works of Alfred Hitchcock, or paying for travel to Tonga to study Polynesian dance, and believes that ministers need to urgently investigate Creative Scotland&rsquo;s spending and take action to show that taxpayers&rsquo; money is being used responsibly.</p>
<p>Supported by: Dr Richard Simpson<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>, David Whitton<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7964.1 Linda Fabiani: Creative Scotland Expenditure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7964) in the name of Hugh Henry, leave out from &quot;concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;considers that throughout history the inspiration for artistic expression has come from all manner of sources, some of which have appeared unlikely at the time; recalls, for example, that in 2001 in Hampden Park 200 children performed an acclaimed dance sequence based on Archie Gemmill&rsquo;s 1978 World Cup goal against Holland; believes that isolating Scottish culture from international influences would be damaging to Scottish creativity and Scottish national life; further believes that there should be no place for politicians to limit or dictate the subject matter of any art form, and deplores any suggestion that difficult economic circumstances can be used to justify censorship of the arts.&quot;</p>
