          <p><strong>*S2M-979#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>The 
            Role of the Higher and Further Education Sector in Attracting Fresh 
            Talent</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive 
            on its Fresh Talent initiative and its aims to counter demographic 
            change and reverse population decline in Scotland; recognises the 
            integral role that the higher and further education sector looks set 
            to play in this project and the objectives of nurturing and retaining 
            home grown talent whilst also attracting individuals from abroad; 
            notes concern, however, at the threat posed by the current dispute 
            between the Universities and Colleges Employers Association and the 
            Association of University Teachers (AUT) and the AUT's contention 
            that, academic, related and research staff could face a potential 
            career earnings loss of as much as £40,000 under the current pay offer 
            tabled by employers; expresses further concern at the suggested move 
            from national to local bargaining and the inevitable lengthening in 
            timescales that would result from any such move; acknowledges that 
            such academic staff play a vital role in the creation and sustainability 
            of a smart, successful Scotland, and encourages both parties to work 
            towards an adequate and timely resolution.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-978</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>BT 
            Internet Green X Code</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates BT 
            for producing the internet safety leaflet <em>The Internet Green X 
            Code</em> and for establishing the online quiz to test children's 
            knowledge of the code; commends the way in which BT has used innovative, 
            interactive and educational ideas to make children aware of internet 
            safety; notes that the code has been endorsed by the Children's Society, 
            Barnardo's, Childline, National Children's Homes, the NSPCC, the Internet 
            Watch Foundation, Parents Online and the Home Office, and is deeply 
            concerned that the Scottish Executive has to date failed to introduce 
            sexual grooming legislation to ensure that Scottish children are protected 
            from the potential dangers of grooming over the internet in line with 
            children in other parts of the UK.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Ted Brocklebank<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-977#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses' Pay and Conditions</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            that the job of nursery nurse represents one of the remaining professions 
            characterised by both an almost exclusively female workforce and an 
            overarching legacy of low pay; notes however, that the increased academic 
            and professional demands upon nursery nurses have been consistently 
            recognised by both the Parliament and wider society in recent months; 
            expresses concern that this consensual public recognition has not 
            been reflected in the form of an adequate and timely settlement for 
            those nursery nurses currently jeopardising their own financial security 
            in an attempt to obtain a remuneration package that fairly represents 
            their job and responsibilities; conveys regret that nursery nurses 
            have now voted overwhelmingly for indefinite strike action to begin 
            on 1 March 2004 that will result in widespread disruption to children's 
            education and massive inconvenience for parents; acknowledges that 
            this dispute represents a potential watershed not only for the future 
            of the nursery service and early years education but also for the 
            issue of equal pay in Scotland, and suggests that a possible route 
            to a satisfactory settlement would be a national review of the nursery 
            service followed by a Scotland-wide regrading of the role of nursery 
            nurses.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-976</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> <strong>LGBT 
            Youth Scotland National Gathering, 5 to 7 March 2004</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) 
            Youth Scotland national gathering is taking place in Edinburgh on 
            5 to 7 March 2004; commends the contribution made to the lives of 
            young people by LGBT Youth Scotland in supporting this event; welcomes 
            the inclusion of a Scottish Parliament outreach information session 
            at the gathering, and welcomes the contribution that the weekend event 
            will make to diversity and equality, encouraging all the young people 
            participating to make their voices heard in building an inclusive 
            Scotland.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-975</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Gift 
            Aid</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that the future 
            of at least six of Scotland's leading visitor attractions has been 
            thrown into jeopardy by plans by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to 
            change the rules on gift aid donations to wildlife and heritage charities 
            such as Edinburgh Zoo, Scotland's second most popular visitor attraction, 
            along with five of Scotland's five star visitor attractions, the Royal 
            Yacht <em>Britannia</em>, Discovery Point and Verdant Works, Dundee, 
            the Scottish Seabird Centre, North Berwick, and the Scottish Mining 
            Museum, Newtongrange, which would all, as a consequence, face serious 
            financial difficulties; notes that some of these attractions may even 
            face the possibility of closure should the public's ability to donate 
            their admission charge to these charities be withdrawn, as proposed, 
            in April 2005; notes that these attractions contribute millions of 
            pounds to their local economies and between them employ over 400 people; 
            notes that in 2003 the benefit of gift aid tax rebates to these four 
            attractions accounted for approximately 10 to 20% of their admission 
            income and, given their very marginal commercial viability, they may 
            now have to face some serious choices with regard to their long-term 
            future, and accordingly calls upon the Scottish Executive to make 
            urgent representations to the Chancellor to retain the current gift 
            aid scheme insofar as it affects these vital visitor attractions.</P>

          <p><strong>*S2M-974</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Civil 
            Contingencies Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament agrees 
            the principle of a single statutory framework for civil protection 
            across the UK, as set out in the Civil Contingencies Bill, and agrees 
            that the relevant provisions in the Bill should be considered by the 
            UK Parliament.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-973</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Companies 
            (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees to the principle that, in the contexts of provisions 
            in the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) 
            Bill enabling charities to convert to become community interest companies, 
            conversion should be regulated and agrees that the provisions in the 
            Bill that relate to the power to regulate such conversion should be 
            considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-972#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Millennium 
            Development Goals</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 10th anniversary 
            of the genocide in Rwanda and continuing poverty in sub-Saharan Africa; 
            recognises the extreme urgency of international efforts in making 
            progress towards achieving the eight millennium development goals 
            by 2015 including the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, achievement 
            of universal primary education, promotion of gender equality and the 
            empowerment of women, reduction of child mortality, improvement of 
            maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring 
            environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for 
            development; further recognises the role that churches and other civic 
            society organisations in Scotland have played in reminding us of our 
            responsibilities to people in the poorest countries, and looks forward 
            to a timetable being set by Her Majesty's Government for meeting its 
            commitment to increase the UK aid budget to 0.7% of gross national 
            product.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-971#</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>World 
            Health Organisation's Bone and Joint Decade 2000 to 2010</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the World Health Organisation's Bone and Joint 
            Decade 2000 to 2010; recognises that musculoskeletal disorders are 
            the most common cause of severe long-term pain and physical disability 
            affecting hundreds of millions of people including many young people 
            around the world; further recognises that joint diseases account for 
            more than half of all chronic conditions in persons aged 60 years 
            and over and that back pain is the second leading cause of sick leave, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider how best 
            to raise awareness of musculoskeletal disorders in Scotland such as 
            rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and ankylosing 
            spondylitis and their impact both on peoples' lives and on the Scottish 
            economy.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-970#</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Association 
            of University Teachers' Industrial Dispute and Strike Action</strong>-That 
            the Parliament supports the campaign by the Association of University 
            Teachers (AUT) for better pay for academic and related staff; notes 
            that the AUT is currently taking strike action, supported by NUS Scotland, 
            and boycotting assessment activity from 1 March 2004 onwards; further 
            notes that since 1980 academic salaries have increased by an average 
            of only 20% compared with a rise in average earnings of 60% and of 
            graduate earnings by still more; believes that fair pay in universities 
            and colleges is essential for recruitment of well-motivated academic 
            staff on whom we rely to create a highly skilled economy in Scotland, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should act on the recommendations 
            in the Enterprise and Culture Committee's <em>Scottish Solutions Inquiry</em> 
            to ensure that investment in higher education in the future will enable 
            staff to be better paid and address problems of recruitment and retention 
            of academic staff.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-969#</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Recognising 
            the Contribution of Scottish Lithuanians</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates the Scottish Lithuanian Cultural and Recreational Social 
            Club in Mossend, Lanarkshire, on the occasion of its 25th anniversary; 
            notes the positive contribution that Lithuanian immigrants have made 
            to Scotland's economy, local communities and special causes; applauds 
            the commitment of members of the club to maintaining a sense of their 
            history; recognises that now, with fifth and sixth generations, the 
            Lithuanian community has integrated successfully but is at risk of 
            losing its cultural identity and language; calls, therefore, for a 
            recognition that, with the accession of Lithuania to the EU, the time 
            is right to welcome further immigrants with much needed skills to 
            Scotland from Lithuania and build on the links already important to, 
            and embedded in, Lanarkshire's culture and history, and hopes that 
            any new immigrants are treated with respect and given a warm welcome 
            in recognition that different communities can and do integrate successfully 
            in Scotland.</P>

            seekers into a deprived area of Glasgow by Maryhill Citizens Advice 
            Bureau (CAB); welcomes the news that Maryhill CAB is poised to embark 
            upon an 18-month drive to recruit refugees as volunteer CAB advisers; 
            notes that up to 80% of the refugees the Bureau sees are professionals 
            such as doctors, teachers, accountants and bankers; offers its congratulations 
            to this project, which is backed by the European Social Fund and is 
            the culmination of almost two years work by Citizens Advice Scotland, 
            Maryhill CAB and other Glasgow bureaux; calls upon the Executive to 
            encourage similar projects throughout Scotland, and believes that 
            such attempts to bring the energy and skills of asylum seekers into

            justice fund will be established to assist communities such as Greengairs, 
            and believes that representatives from communities such as Greengairs

            notes that Scotland's nursery nurses deliver an excellent package 
            of pre-school education and care to Scotland's children but receive 
            a woefully inadequate salary in return; further notes that Scotland's 
            nursery nurses have not had their pay reviewed for over 15 years, 
            have been trying to negotiate an improved pay and conditions package 
            for over three years and have been involved in selective industrial 
            action in pursuit of their claim for over nine months, but sadly both 
            the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Executive 
            have ignored the pleas of UNISON on behalf of the nursery nurses and 
            the nursery nurses have now voted by an 80% margin to embark on all-out 
            strike action; accepts that such all-out strike action will cause 
            difficulties for thousands of parents, but believes that nursery nurses 
            have been left with no choice; resolves, therefore, to support their 
            action by visiting picket lines, attending rallies and meetings and 
            organising financial donations, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to intervene on the side of the nursery nurses in recognition of the 
            fact that they are scandalously low-paid and deserve a starting salary 
            of £14,000 per annum and an improved career structure.</P>

            vaccination, ensuring high vaccination rates and monitoring the safety 
            of vaccines&quot;, which means that &quot;they serve as their own

            representing care commission officers working for the Scottish Commission 
            for the Regulation of Care, to the Scottish Executive consultation 
            paper on proposals for maximum fees to be levied by the Care Commission; 
            notes in particular that the response questions whether it is realistic 
            that the cost of regulation be covered by fee income generation and 
            that currently there is a significant shortfall between the cost of 
            regulation and fee income generation; notes that, if full cost is 
            implemented even incrementally as the Executive intends, the response 
            doubts whether the current level of regulation and protection for 
            service users can be sustained without making fees prohibitively expensive; 
            notes that to make ends meet it may be necessary to reduce the levels 
            of regulatory visits and workforce to meet available income, with 
            &quot;resulting consequences for the safeguarding of vulnerable service 
            users&quot;; refers to the answer to question S2W-4301 by Mr Tom McCabe 
            on 5 December 2003 stating that a financial and management policy 
            review of the Care Commission is not due until April 2007, and therefore, 
            in all these circumstances, and given the informed source of these

            notes the refusal of the universities to re-open negotiations with 
            the AUT on these issues; further notes that, whilst academic and related

            have been, since the mid-1990s, awarded pay rises twice as high as
