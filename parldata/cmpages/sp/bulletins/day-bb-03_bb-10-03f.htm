            of John Swinburne MSP</strong>-That the Parliament condemns, and dissociates 
            itself from, the comments of John Swinburne MSP in the debate on mainstreaming 
            equality in the Parliament on Wednesday 1 October 2003 and calls on

          <P> <strong>*S2M-447#</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Nuclear 
            Submarine Decommisioning</strong>-That the Parliament condemns any 
            plans to cut up and dispose of nuclear waste from the reactor compartments 
            of decommissioned nuclear submarines stored in Scotland; considers 
            that land-based storage at Rosyth of sealed reactor compartments cut 
            out from those decommissioned submarines currently stored afloat is 
            the best environmental option, and further considers that no additional 
            nuclear submarines should be brought to Scotland for disposal or storage 
            and that no new nuclear submarines should be added to the naval fleet.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-446</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Deaths 
            of Young Servicemen and Women at Deepcut Barracks</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes that more than 1748 members of Her Majesty's armed 
            forces have lost their lives through non-natural and non-combat causes 
            since 1990, that almost 200 deaths have been caused by discharge of 
            firearms and that some 200 of the deaths are described as self-inflicted; 
            further notes the courage and determination of the friends and families 
            of Sean Benton, James Collinson, Geoff Gray and Cheryl James who died 
            at Deepcut Barracks in Surrey and the friends and families of Paul 
            Cochrane, Ross Collins, Richard Donkin, Tony Green, Dale Little, Aled 
            Martin Jones, Alfie Manship, Gary Riches, Richard Robertson, Alan 
            Sharples, David Shipley and Christopher Young who have subsequently 
            come forward to make public their own grievances and frustrations 
            at the hands of the military authorities; believes that the Ministry 
            of Defence response to these deaths is inadequate and distressing 
            to the bereaved; further believes that the army has a duty of care 
            and protection towards all personnel, particularly young soldiers, 
            that the culture of secrecy surrounding the varied causes of these 
            deaths must give way to greater transparency and that the environment 
            in which these deaths continue to occur and the absence of a system 
            for prompt, effective and independent investigation of deaths has 
            led to a breakdown in public confidence that can only be restored 
            through a full and independent public inquiry, and therefore resolves 
            to urge Her Majesty's Government to establish a tribunal of inquiry 
            without delay.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-445</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Use 
            of Language by the Executive on Anti-social Behaviour</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is appalled at the use of stigmatising and ill-informed 
            language in recent debates; is further appalled at the Scottish Executive's 
            use of the word &quot;plague&quot; in a press release in reference 
            to the anti-social behaviour debate; recognises that those referred 
            to as persistent young offenders are overwhelmingly the most vulnerable, 
            disadvantaged and sometimes abused section of the population, and 
            calls on the Executive to define who the &quot;plague&quot; is, explain 
            its use of the word, withdraw the comments and apologise unreservedly.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-444</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Food 
            Advertising on TV</strong>-That the Parliament notes that research 
            by the University of Strathclyde on behalf of the Food Standards Agency 
            found that TV adverts are responsible for children eating too much 
            sugar, fat and salt and that research by the Food Commission found 
            that food advertising accounts for half of all advertising during 
            children's viewing time and, in light of this research, calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to introduce a ban on the advertising of junk food 
            to children in line with calls from the Scottish Consumer Council, 
            the British Heart Foundation, the Royal College of General Practitioners, 
            the Food Commission and 80 other organisations.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-443#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Executive Relocation Policy</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            that the formula used to shortlist locations suitable for the relocation 
            of the Scottish Executive departments, agencies and non-departmental 
            bodies is not resulting in jobs being dispersed adequately across 
            Scotland and calls on the Executive to re-examine the criteria used 
            to select such locations.</P>
