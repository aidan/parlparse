          <p><strong>*S1M-3017</strong> <strong>Fiona McLeod: Removal of Dr Robert 
            Watson from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</strong>-That 
            the Parliament expresses concern at the removal of Dr Robert Watson 
            as Chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change following 
            last year's publication of its Third Assessment Report (TAR) which 
            states that global temperatures are rising nearly twice as fast as 
            previously thought, predicts that temperatures could rise by as much 
            as 5.8 degrees Celsius by the end of this century and claims that 
            industrial pollution is the main cause; notes that the TAR report 
            has the unqualified backing of more than 3,000 scientists; expresses 
            dismay at President Bush's continued refusal to recognise the link 
            between pollution and global warming; urges the President to reinstate 
            America's support for the Kyoto Protocol, and further notes Scotland's 
            determination to play its full part in tackling the threat of global 
            warming.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3016</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: The 150th Anniversary 
            of The Lifeboat Magazine</strong>-That the Parliament warmly commends 
            the editor and staff of <em>The Lifeboat</em>, the magazine of the 
            Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), on its 150th anniversary; 
            believes that <em>The Lifeboat</em> plays an important role in informing 
            its many readers of all elements of the lifeboat service, including 
            detailed accounts of the numerous rescues carried out by the gallant 
            lifeboat crews, fleet renewals, the fundraising activities of dedicated 
            RNLI supporters and much more; remembers, too, the efforts of previous 
            editors and staff of the magazine who ensured its survival during 
            difficult years, including the two world wars, and, in particular, 
            offers sincere thanks to the crews of the lifeboats whose bravery 
            is so readily acknowledged in the pages of <em>The Lifeboat </em>and 
            by those who live in our maritime communities.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3015</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes: Stop AIDS Campaign</strong>-That 
            the Parliament supports the Stop AIDS Campaign in its efforts to bring 
            together a wide range of groups in the UK in order to raise awareness 
            about the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and to campaign for increased UK 
            and international action; notes that there are over 36 million people 
            living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, of which 3,400 are in Scotland, and 
            encourages people throughout Scotland to support the Stop AIDS Campaign 
            when activists from Africa and the Caribbean visit Scotland to speak 
            about their experiences on 7 and 8 May 2002.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3014</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Mental Health 
            Expenditure</strong>-That the Parliament regrets that no mention was 
            made of mental health services during the parliamentary statement 
            by Jack McConnell on the UK Budget and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to give substance to the lip-service it pays to mental health as a 
            national clinical priority.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3013</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Queen of the South: 
            Second Division Champions</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the players, manager, board, staff and supporters of Queen of the 
            South Football Club not only for having achieved promotion to the 
            First Division but also for securing the Second Division championship; 
            recognises that the team's achievements over the past season have 
            served as a tremendous psychological boost for the whole area, particularly 
            in the aftermath of the foot-and-mouth disease crisis, and wishes 
            the team and everyone associated with the club well in their endeavours 
            in the First Division.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3012</strong> <strong>Fiona McLeod: The Scotland Act 
            1998 (Agency Arrangements) (Specifications) (No.2) Order 2002</strong>-That 
            the Transport and the Environment Committee <a name="MotionText">recommends 
            that nothing further be done under the Scotland Act 1998 (Agency Arrangements)
