            a reliable, safe, efficient and sustainable transport system to connect 
            Scotland and encourage economic growth; recognises the importance

            authority, and recognises that the public transport system must serve 
            the environmental, health and educational needs of people of Scotland.</p>

            aimed at restocking Iraq&#146;s looted university libraries; notes 
            with sadness that the University of Baghdad alone lost 600,000 books; 
            further notes, with pleasure, that this project has attracted considerable 
            support, and urges the Scottish Executive to make a financial contribution

          <p> <strong>*S2M-125</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: Road Safety</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament believes that the cause of road safety in Scotland 
            would be aided by vehicles keeping their lights on at all times in 
            order to aid visibility and asks that future road safety campaigns 
            include this as a sensible contribution that all drivers can make 
            to the reduction of accidents.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-124</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Europe</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament supports the European Union as a confederation that 
            collectively exercises certain sovereign rights pooled by states but 
            in which each state retains its own sovereignty in respect of constitutional, 
            fiscal and other matters of national importance; believes that decisions 
            about pooled and retained sovereignty should always be taken in Scotland&#146;s 
            national interest; therefore welcomes the development of a European 
            constitution but opposes the conferral of exclusive European Union 
            competence over the conservation of marine biological resources under 
            the common fisheries policy; considers that the terms of the final 
            draft constitution should be subject to the approval of the Scottish 
            people in a referendum prior to ratification; regrets that the decision 
            by Her Majesty&#146;s Government to delay entry to the single currency 
            does not take account of Scotland&#146;s economic interests, and believes 
            that Scotland&#146;s interests would best be represented in the European 
            Union as an independent member state.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-123#</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Seroxat</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the recommendations by the Committee on the Safety 
            of Medicines regarding the prescribing of seroxat to those aged under 
            18, which have called for this drug not to be prescribed to those 
            suffering from depression, and notes that seroxat is not licensed 
            for use by under-18s and has been reportedly the cause of high levels 
            of self-harm and suicidal behaviour.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-122</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Scottish H.A.R.T. 
            (Scottish Heart at Risk Testing)</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that Heart Week is from 7 to 15 June 2003; commends the work 
            of Scottish H.A.R.T. (Heart at Risk Testing), a Borders-based national 
            charity that researches into all heart diseases, especially cardiomyopathy, 
            raises funds for a mobile screening unit which, with trained staff, 
            will test the health of all young Scottish athletes and campaigns 
            for defibrillators, including automatic external defibrillators, to 
            be provided in all large-scale public venues such as train and bus 
            stations, superstores, sports arenas and swimming pools; notes that 
            the charity recently presented a defibrillator to the Royal Commonwealth 
            Pool, Edinburgh, and that the Lochaber rescue team, through funds 
            raised, will be presenting a defibrillator to the rescue centre at 
            Ben Nevis on behalf of the charity, and commends the determination 
            of Wilma and Kenneth Gunn who, from the tragic loss of their own son 
            Cameron through cardiomyopathy, have developed this positive and growing

          <p> <strong>S2M-110*#*</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Valuing Carers</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the hard work and dedication of Scotland's 
            115,675 unpaid carers, a workforce comparable to the total NHS workforce 
            in Scotland; acknowledges the role of Scotland's carer population 
            as partners in the provision of care; recognises the measures outlined 
            in <em>Partnership for Care: Scotland&#146;s Health White Paper</em> 
            and in the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 to increase 
            partnership working across the health and social care services; notes 
            that the health and well-being of many carers are affected as a direct 
            consequence of the physical and emotional strains of caring; welcomes 
            the dedication of care assistants across Scotland in providing vital 
            respite services to carers and their families; congratulates the UK-wide 
            network of 30,000 Princess Royal Trust for Carers centres on the level 
            of support that they provide to carers and their families; recognises 
            that there are many more unidentified carers in Scotland and that, 
            for appropriate support to be administered, these carers must be identified; 
            further welcomes the publication of <em>Focus on Carers and the NHS 
            - identifying and supporting hidden carers - Good Practice Guide </em>by 
            the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and the strategies for identifying 
            carers contained therein, and *considers that<strong>*</strong> the 
            Scottish Executive *should* target resources specifically on identifying 
            and supporting carers in order that the vision underpinning recent 
            legislation can be realised.</p>
