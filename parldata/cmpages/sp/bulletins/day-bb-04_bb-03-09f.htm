          <p><strong>*S2M-1012</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Proposal 
            for a New Crematorium at Sydes Braes, High Blantyre</strong>&#8212;That 
            the Parliament regrets the planning application made to South Lanarkshire 
            Council in respect of the building of a crematorium at the Sydes Brae 
            site in High Blantyre; believes that such building in that locality 
            is unnecessary as existing crematoria in the area are operating below 
            capacity and that construction will result in the destruction of much-valued 
            public space in an area where there are few such features, and calls 
            on South Lanarkshire Council to reject the application.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1011#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Enhancing 
            Communities through Opposing Discrimination</strong>&#8212;That the 
            Parliament notes the negative effects of segregated housing in preventing 
            community unity and in diminishing the quality of life for everyone 
            concerned and believes that the Scottish Executive should oppose all 
            measures aimed at segregating housing in Scotland according to race, 
            social status or occupation; expresses its concern that such measures 
            might, whilst not being explicitly discriminatory, have discriminatory 
            outcomes, excluding groups according to race, social status or occupation, 
            and further believes that the Executive should promote all measures 
            to enhance liveability and beneficial interaction throughout Scotland&#8217;s 
            communities.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1010#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Management 
            of Wild Deer</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament acknowledges the excellent 
            work carried out by the Association of Deer Management Groups and 
            their members throughout Scotland in managing our wild herds; further 
            acknowledges the importance of the wild game industry to Scotland 
            in providing jobs and income for rural communities; appreciates the 
            significant expense involved in funding essential management plans 
            and habitat assessments to ensure the best possible management of 
            deer herds, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider 
            positively a request for funding for such management of &#163;1 million 
            over three years.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1009</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>National 
            Science Week 12 to 21 March 2004</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            notes that National Science Week takes place between 12 and 21 March 
            2004; notes that the aims of National Science Week are to celebrate 
            science and its importance to our lives; welcomes the opportunity 
            it gives people from across Scotland to participate in science activities 
            and experiments and to engage in science discussions; congratulates 
            the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BA) for co-ordinating 
            National Science Week which last year attracted hundreds of thousands 
            of people across the UK, and encourages its members to visit the BA 
            website www.the-ba.net/nsw and join in activities in their constituency 
            or region.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1008#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Autistic 
            Spectrum Disorders - Good Practice Guidance</strong>&#8212;That the 
            Parliament recognises the importance of making improvements in the 
            understanding of autistic spectrum disorders and in the provision 
            that is made for children and adults with the condition and their 
            families; welcomes the Department for Education and Skills&#8217; 
            publication <em>Autistic Spectrum Disorders: Good Practice Guidance</em>, 
            that sets out guidelines for agencies working with children with autism 
            and focuses on support provided by schools and local education authorities, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should give consideration 
            to the preparation of a similar set of guidelines for local authorities 
            and agencies in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1007</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Fair 
            Trade Cities - Aberdeen and Dundee</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            congratulates the cities of Aberdeen and Dundee on the launch of their 
            fair trade status on Friday 5 March 2004; believes that the principle 
            of fair trade is something to which Scotland as a nation should aspire; 
            further believes that those towns and cities in Scotland that do not 
            currently have fair trade status should seek to attain it as soon 
            as possible, and urges all catering companies and public organisations 
            in Scotland to use fair trade products in a bid to further promote 
            this cause.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-1006</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Erskine 
            Bridge Tolls</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes with grave disappointment 
            the statement by Trish Godman MSP on 4 March 2004 in the Parliament 
            that she has opposed tolls on the Erskine Bridge since &quot;day one&quot; 
            when it considers that the <em>Official Report,</em> on 6 September 
            2001, clearly shows that this is not so; believes that Trish Godman 
            MSP has failed in her role of upholding the aspirations of wisdom, 
            justice, compassion and integrity of the Scottish people for their 
            members of the Parliament, and considers that she should set the record 
            straight by acknowledging that in the last session of the Parliament 
            she supported tolls and voted in favour of them.</p>
