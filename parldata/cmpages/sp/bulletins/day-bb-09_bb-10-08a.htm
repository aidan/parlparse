<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am&#9;</strong>Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: School Buildings&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4988</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>School Buildings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the Scottish Futures Trust has yet to fund a single new school building in Scotland despite the 2009 School Estate Statistics revealing that around 150,000 pupils remain in schools classified as being in poor or bad condition; is dismayed that, after more than two years, the SNP government has identified only 14 schools to be built under its first school building programme, that none of these 14 schools will be open to pupils in this parliamentary term and only 55 will be built in total by 2018; further believes that the SNP government&rsquo;s claims on the number of schools that it has commissioned are unsustainable given that its own School Estate Statistics reveal that a majority of schools built or substantially refurbished in the last two financial years were legacy PPP projects, and further believes that it is hypocritical for ministers to criticise PPP schools while praising them at their official opening and that the SNP&rsquo;s record in government is falling far short of its 2007 election manifesto pledge to &quot;match the current school building programme brick for brick, and offer an alternative funding mechanism through the Scottish Futures Trust&quot;. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4988.3</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: School Buildings</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4988) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the Scottish Government inherited a school estate where around 260,000 pupils were in schools classified as being in poor or bad condition; welcomes the fact that this figure has fallen by 100,000 since May 2007 due to the &pound;2 billion of investment in the school estate supported by the Scottish Government; recognises that in excess of 250 schools will be built during this parliamentary term compared with just 205 during the four years of the previous administration and that the Scottish Government will exceed its pledge to match the previous administration&rsquo;s plans brick for brick; commends the Scottish Government and local authorities for the increased pace of school project completions with the rate of delivery up from 0.76 schools per week over the eight years of the previous administration to an anticipated 1.2 per week over the period from May 2007 to April 2011 and further commends the additional investment over and above the schools that will be delivered through the capital budget allocations of each local authority, which will see an additional &pound;1.25 billion deliver a further 55 new or refurbished school buildings across Scotland, and further welcomes the fact that the Scottish Futures Trust will play a central role in coordinating, facilitating and managing the new school building programme.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4988.1</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith: School Buildings</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4988) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;, and believes that the school building programme should be funded so as to deliver best value for money and that all sources of finance, including those in the private sector, should be considered.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4988.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: School Buildings</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4988) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;; deeply regrets the ongoing ambiguity over the future allocation of resources under the school building programme and the absolute failure of the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT); considers that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s centralisation and poor handling of the school building strategy has caused serious uncertainty for local authorities and has undermined the autonomy of councils to determine their local priorities, and calls for the SFT to be scrapped immediately.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Volunteering&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-4985</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Volunteering</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and celebrates the role of the voluntary sector and volunteers across Scotland in supporting individuals, families and communities and in shaping and delivering services locally; notes the excellent work of volunteering organisations in encouraging volunteering through offering training and volunteering placements and particularly in reaching out to those who might not otherwise have the chance to volunteer; agrees, given the opportunity that volunteering provides to develop skills and build confidence, that, in this economic recession, volunteering organisations should be given adequate resources to allow them to do that important work, and further agrees that innovative organisations that create structured volunteering placements for young people, such as ProjectScotland, should be recognised and supported by the Scottish Government.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-4985.1</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Volunteering</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4985) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end &quot;considers that young people are a huge pool of untapped talent and potential who are at risk of becoming a lost generation as a result of the current economic downturn; notes that engaging young people in the voluntary sector would provide a valuable resource for the organisations concerned; recognises the pressures put on the voluntary sector by the local government concordat and single outcome agreements, as well as local authorities&rsquo; tight financial settlement, and believes that, with proper, structured and sustainable funding from central and local government, the current economic downturn presents an opportunity for a strong and active voluntary sector to play an enhanced role in the delivery of frontline services.&quot;</p>
