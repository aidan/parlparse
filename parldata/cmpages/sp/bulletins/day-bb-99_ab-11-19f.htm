    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-306</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: National Air Traffic Services</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament believes that air safety in Scotland is best served through the retention
    of the national air traffic services in the public sector; rejects Her Majesty's
    Government&#146;s plans to privatise national air traffic services, and supports the
    campaign of the relevant trade unions on behalf of the public and in the interests of air
    safety throughout Scotland to keep air traffic control in the public sector where it
    belongs.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-305</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Shopmobility Highland</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament congratulates Shopmobility Highland on reaching its fifth birthday and
    recognises the invaluable service which it has provided over this period providing for
    disabled people&#146;s access to shops in Inverness and more recently in Dingwall; notes
    that Shopmobility Highland now has around 3,200 registered users, and pledges support for
    its continued success and secure funding to ensure that disabled people can enjoy the
    access to shops which is taken for granted by other people.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-304#</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Asylum and Immigration Act</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament is concerned that aspects of the Asylum and Immigration Act will
    effectively amend Scottish legislation pertaining to social work, the health service,
    mental health, children&#146;s rights and housing; considers that the Scottish Parliament
    should, therefore, be consulted on this matter; believes that the cash payments to asylum
    seekers should continue in Scotland; and believes that the Scottish Parliament should
    consider supplementing financial resources provided to local authorities by the Home
    Office in relation to the Act&#146;s provisions and that the timetable for the Act&#146;s
    implementation in Scotland should be extended to April 2000 to allow time to address the
    specific problems which the Act poses for Scotland.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Shona Robison<strong>*</strong>, Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p><strong>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    </strong><p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-303#</strong> <strong>Dr Winnie Ewing: Sign Language </strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes that the British Sign Language is used as an essential communication tool
    by a substantial number of people in Scotland and has a strong historic tradition;
    recognises the pressure on interpreters who are in constant demand particularly in rural
    areas; notes that the British Deaf Association is seeking review of the recognition,
    rights and support applied to the language, and expresses the hope that the Scottish
    Executive will assist the process by taking actions to implement the European
    Parliament&#146;s recognition of Sign Language as an official language in each of the
    member states.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-302#</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Streetlighting in Longriggend</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament views with concern the implication of the closure of HM Prison Longriggend
    on the people of Longriggend village and notes that following this closure in April 2000
    the village will be left without maintained streetlighting or maintained roads.</p>

    </strong><p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-301</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Meetings of the Parliament in Stirling</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises that it must consider alternative temporary accommodation for
    the month of May 2000 when the Church of Scotland is likely to require use of the Assembly
    Hall for its General Assembly and calls upon the Parliamentary Bureau to seriously
    consider Stirling as a possible location with its modern facilities, historic past,
    central location and excellent transport links.</p>

    the Parliament supports the campaign of the Public and Commercial Services Union to oppose

    proposal poses a threat to safety in Scottish skies and calls upon the Scottish Executive
    to make representations to Her Majesty's Government opposing the proposal.</p>
