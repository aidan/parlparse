          <P><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by

            European Higher Education III</em> that &quot;Higher education was 
            already included in the 1994 round of GATS negotiations but has assumed 
            a much more prominent and highly disputed position in the current 
            round&quot;, in light of the Executive's statement that &quot;the 
            EC has not and does not intend to make any offer in the area of public

            be assessed in each country.</P>
          <P><strong>S2W-2939</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it has consulted higher education stakeholders

            the conclusions of the Bologna follow-up seminar &quot;Exploring the 
            Social Dimensions of the European Higher Education Area&quot; which 
            expressed &quot;the need for transparency in the GATS negotiations
