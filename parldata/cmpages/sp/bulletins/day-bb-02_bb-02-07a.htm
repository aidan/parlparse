            <p>The Clerk has been advised of the topics of the following Scottish 
              National Party business.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>9.30 am&#9;Debate on Scotland's Road Network- </p>
            <p><strong>S1M-2703</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> 
              <strong>Scotland's Road Network</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
              with concern recent dangers and problems affecting travellers and 
              the economy and caused by a deteriorating winter roads maintenance 
              service; believes that the privatisation of trunk road maintenance 
              is a false economy, resulting in loss of efficiencies of scale, 
              knock-on increased costs to local authorities for clearing non-trunk 
              roads and an overall cost in the form of reduced standards of service; 
              further notes that BEAR Scotland Ltd and Amey Highways Ltd have 
              failed to deliver a quality of service necessary for the safety 
              of road users and the movement of goods, and condemns the Scottish 
              Executive for its actions in ignoring warnings regarding privatisation 
              and in failing to address the current problems. </p>
            <dir> 
              <dir> 
                <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
                <p><strong>S1M-2703.1</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Scotland's 
                  Road Network</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2703) in 
                  the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; 
                  to end and insert &quot;the actions taken by the Scottish Executive 
                  to ensure that the trunk road maintenance contracts deliver 
                  the prescribed level of service; calls upon the Executive to 
                  continue monitoring the performance of the operating companies 
                  to ensure compliance with their contractual obligations, and 
                  further invites the Executive to enter into dialogue with local 
                  authorities to assess the effects of the contracts on local 
                  roads maintenance.&quot; </p>
                <p> <strong>S1M-2703.2</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Scotland's

                  the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; 
                  to end and insert &quot;supports the principle of competitive 
                  tendering in relation to public works contracts, such as the 
                  contract for trunk roads management and maintenance, in view 
                  of the paramount importance of securing best value for the taxpayer 
                  at both local and national levels; notes concerns raised in 
                  respect of the operation of the trunk road maintenance contracts 
                  by BEAR Scotland Ltd and Amey Highways Ltd; calls upon the Scottish 
                  Executive to produce a report on the performance of each company, 
                  as recommended by the Auditor General for Scotland; further 
                  notes concern about the level of non-trunk road maintenance 
                  being carried out by local authorities, and further calls upon 
                  the Scottish Executive to (a) review and report to the Parliament 
                  on the implications of disaggregation of trunk and local services 
                  for local authorities and (b) set up a system for (i) monitoring 
                  and reporting the level of maintenance required on non-trunk 
                  roads and (ii) measuring the actual level of maintenance achieved 
                  on such roads.&quot; </p>

            <p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Debate on Class Sizes and Pupil Attainment- 
            </p>
            <p><strong>S1M-2697</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> <strong>Class 
              Sizes and Pupil Attainment</strong>-That the Parliament notes increasing 
              research that indicates considerable short-, medium- and long-term 
              benefits from reducing early primary class sizes, preferably to 
              18 or below, and the particular impact that such reductions have 
              on children living in poverty; further notes the performance indicators 
              2000-01 report by the Accounts Commission published on 24 January 
              2002, which shows that the Scottish Executive has not yet achieved 
              its own class size targets, and therefore calls on all parties in 
              the Parliament to support the SNP's radical initiatives on this 
              matter as an important step in not only assisting individual educational 
              attainment and individual lifetime achievement, but also bringing 
              collective economic benefit for Scotland as a whole. </p>

                <p><strong>S1M-2697.2</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Class Sizes 
                  and Pupil Attainment</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2697) 
                  in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; 
                  to end and insert &quot;believes that class size is an important 
                  aspect of educational provision; notes that the performance 
                  indicators recently published by the Accounts Commission relate 
                  to the financial year 2000-01 whilst the targets in the Programme 
                  for Government relate to the financial year 2001-02; welcomes 
                  the progress that the Scottish Executive and local authorities 
                  have made in reducing the size of Primary 1 to Primary 3 classes; 
                  recognises that education is about developing individuals to 
                  their full potential, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
                  should continue to promote the raising of standards in education 
                  through the implementation of the National Priorities for Education 
                  at national, local authority and school level.&quot;</p>
                <p><strong>S1M-2697.1</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Class 
                  Sizes and Pupil Attainment</strong>-As an amendment to motion 
                  (S1M-2697) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from &quot;increasing&quot; 
                  to end and insert &quot;that the reduction in class sizes in 
                  Primary 1 to Primary 3 to 18 would involve a substantial revenue 
                  cost and an unquantifiable capital cost together with a removal 
                  of parental choice; acknowledges that class size is only one 
                  aspect of educational provision which may help to improve standards 
                  in Scotland's schools, and considers that greater devolution 
                  of decision making to teachers and parents should be the goal 
                  of the Scottish Executive.&quot; </p>
