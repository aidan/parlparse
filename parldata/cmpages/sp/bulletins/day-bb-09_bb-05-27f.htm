<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4246</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Supporting Scottish Business</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the serious difficulties faced by  the Scottish businesses struggling to access the funds that they need during the economic downturn, with the double squeeze of late payment and tighter lending a critical concern for small businesses in particular; notes that the Welsh Assembly Government is using European Investment Bank (EIB) funding to help small businesses bridge funding gaps, supporting the expansion of 800 businesses and creating up to 15,000 jobs across Wales; regrets that the Scottish Government has not introduced a similar initiative in Scotland; further regrets the Scottish Government&rsquo;s inaction and delay in utilising the EIB funding available to it; believes that SNP ministers should use every lever at their disposal to help Scotland&rsquo;s economy, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a statement before the summer recess containing new plans to use EIB funding to support small businesses so that they do not continue to be at a competitive disadvantage to their Welsh counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4245</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>A Missing Children Alert System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the establishment of strong cross-Europe working to ensure that there are effective, linked &quot;am ber alert&quot; systems in place to bring European-wide attention to missing children; understands that early action is critical in locating missing and abducted children and that the experience of those countries that have alert systems in place, such as the United States of am erica, is extremely positive; welcomes the formal adoption of the written declaration on Emergency Cooperation In Recovering Missing Children as a resolution of the European Parliament in April 2009 but regrets that European countries currently fail to cooperate effectively when recovering missing children and that progress has been slow, and calls on the Scottish Government to work proactively and constructively with the UK Government to ensure that all missing children alert systems and cross-border cooperation policies, including the 116 000 European hotline, are operational as soon as possible to bind the country effectively into the European system.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4244</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Cashback for Communities: Investing the Proceeds of Crime Back Into Our Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the fact that, since its launch in January 2008, the CashBack for Communities program me has provided positive opportunities and activities for over 100,000 young people in Scotland; recognises that providing healthy and fun activities not only gives young people something to do, but can help in reducing crime and antisocial behaviour by  diverting the small minority who cause trouble away from such behaviour; welcomes the fact that the CashBack program me has been funded through &pound;12 million recovered from criminals using the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and commends the significant efforts of partners in the CashBack program me including Youthlink, Scottish Football Association, Scottish Rugby  Union, Basketballscotland, Scottish Sports Futures, sportscotland, Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council, as well as the very many local projects and volunteers that are making the scheme a success.</p>
<p>Supported by : Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4243</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Proposal for a Committee Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the proposal for a Committee Bill, under Rule 9.15, contained in the Review of SPCB Supported Bodies Committee&rsquo;s 1st Report, 2009 <em>Review of SPCB Supported Bodies</em> (SP Paper 266).</p>
