by: Euan Robson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3377</STRONG> <STRONG>Irene 
McGugan: Scottish Football</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
the current demise of Scottish football at both club and international levels; 
calls on the Scottish Executive to urgently obtain from the Scottish Football 
Association a detailed report confirming the current status of the report commissioned 
from Ernie Walker's Think-tank, including any aspects which have been implemented, 
areas outstanding and parts needing to be updated in view of changing events and 
circumstances, and further calls on the Executive to ensure that funding by it, 
either directly or indirectly, to football bodies and organisations is dependent 
on the report as updated being implemented in full and without further delay.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3376</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Andrew Wilson: Performance of the Scottish Economy</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with great concern the latest government figures on economic 
growth showing Scotland has entered official recession for the first time in twenty 
years; recognises that this recession is the latest symptom of economic under-performance 
in Scotland over a protracted period and that Scotland has the potential to perform 
much better than it has; resolves that the performance of the Scottish economy 
should be of prime importance to the agenda of the Executive, the Parliament and 
all concerned with the well-being of the people of Scotland and the sustainable 
financing of public service investments, and therefore calls upon the Executive 
to set an ambitious target for improving Scotland&#146;s trend rate of growth 
and contribute to a mature, serious and open-minded debate about the best policy 
measures to achieve that target, keeping an open mind about both the limits of 
existing powers and the potential competitive benefits of properly focussed policies 
with the full powers of independence.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3375</STRONG> <STRONG>Nicola 
Sturgeon: Acute Services Review</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the 
proposed £700 million investment in the modernisation of Glasgow&#146;s hospitals; 
considers, however, that the plan by Greater Glasgow NHS Board for the re-structuring 
of acute services in Glasgow is unacceptable in its current form; is particularly 
concerned about the proposed number and location of in-patient hospitals and the 
reduction of accident and emergency departments from five to two, and calls upon 
the Minister for Health and Community Care to suspend his approval of the board&#146;s 
plan and to establish an independent expert group to conduct, within six months, 
an impartial review of the plan, with a view to identifying proposals which command 
greater public acceptance and which can be implemented within a rapid timeframe.</P><P>Supported 
by: Shona Robison<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3374#</STRONG> <STRONG>Marilyn 
Livingstone: National Construction Week 3-10 October 2002</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament supports National Construction Week from 3 to 10 October 2002 and recognises 
the many economic advantages for Scotland that an expanding construction industry 
will bring, notably in employment preservation and creation, training, skills 
and provision of the built environment; supports the industry&#146;s schemes to 
register construction firms through the Construction Licensing Executive and workers 
through approved registration schemes, thereby protecting the public by eradicating 
rogue traders, enhancing the industry&#146;s image, and improving the skills base 
and health and safety practices; acknowledges that the Scottish Executive, local 
authorities and other government bodies can assist by (a) supporting registration 
schemes by insisting that all public works contractors are committed to them, 
(b) supporting the education and training infrastructure so that it meets Scotland&#146;s 
construction requirements, (c) acting as an enlightened client by ensuring, where 
possible, advanced programmes of work on which the industry can plan its skills 
requirements and provide its workforce with security of employment and (d) ensuring 
that public works contracts are fair, open, effective and straightforward to administer 
and deliver.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3373</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Colon Cancer 
Concern CCC Roadshow</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Colon Cancer 
Concern on its national education campaign, the CCC Roadshow, which is visiting 
16 towns and city centres across the UK, notes that the campaign is designed to 
increase awareness of colorectal cancer, the third most common type of cancer 
in the UK and the second most common cause of cancer death; wishes Colon Cancer 
Concern all success in its campaign, and urges the Scottish Executive to give 
its full support to the campaign and provide whatever assistance is necessary 
to increase awareness of colorectal cancer.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3372#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Shona Robison: Ninewells Hospital's Participation in BBC Television Series</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates the staff of Ninewells Hospital for taking part in 
the BBC television series &quot;Ninewells&quot;, which is following the work of 
the accident and emergency department at the hospital; recognises the hard work 
and dedication of the staff involved, and appreciates their professionalism in 
often difficult and challenging circumstances, as demonstrated by the programme.</P><P>Supported 
by: Bruce Crawford<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3371</STRONG> <STRONG>Michael 
Russell: Scottish Media Group - Sale of Publishing Business</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the decision of the Scottish Media Group to sell <em>The Herald, 
The Sunday Herald</em> and <em>The Evening Times</em> as well as a range of magazine 
titles; expresses the view that it is important that the sale, particularly of 
the newspapers, helps to increase the diversity of media ownership in Scotland 
and does not further concentrate it in a few hands; calls on Her Majesty&#146;s 
Government to ensure that any consideration of monopoly issues which may be raised 
by the sale is based on the recognition of a Scottish media market as opposed 
to a UK one, and is firmly of the opinion that any sale must not compromise the 
editorial independence, integrity and overall quality of the newspapers which 
presently make a considerable contribution to Scottish life.<STRONG><em> R</em></STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3370</STRONG> <STRONG>Paul Martin: Policy Advice on Glasgow in the 
Post Second World War Period</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
the poor policy advice relating to Glasgow provided by Scottish Office advisers 
during the period after the second world war and calls on the Scottish Executive 
to take steps to ensure that the recommendations of the cities review will act 
as a means towards continuing to develop an ambitious and vibrant Glasgow. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3369</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Cathy Jamieson: Protection of Children (Scotland) Bill</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">agrees to the general principles of the Protection 
of Children (Scotland) Bill.</A></P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3368.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr 
John Swinney: Scotland's Links with the United States of America</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3368) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from 
&quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the dignity and courage shown 
by the people of the United States of America in the aftermath of 11 September 
2001; notes the educational, historical, cultural and economic links between Scotland 
and the USA and wishes to see these developed and enhanced to the mutual benefit 
of both countries, and, in the spirit of those links, urges the US administration 
to publish incontrovertible evidence to justify any offensive military action 
against Iraq and obtain a fresh United Nations mandate before embarking on any 
such initiative.&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Roseanna Cunningham<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

<STRONG>Mr John McAllion: Scotland's Links with the United States of America</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3368) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, <A NAME="AmendmentText">insert 
at end &quot;however, and in view of these strong links with the USA, expresses 
its deepest possible concern over the increasingly isolationist stance of the 
USA on international issues concerning the environment, justice, trade and international 
relations, particularly in relation to Iraq; opposes the planned invasion and 
aerial bombardment of Iraq in recognition of the fact that, as in Afghanistan, 
the victims of such action will be thousands of ordinary men, women and children, 
completely unconnected to the odious regime of Saddam Hussein; states its opposition 
to waging any further war on Iraq based on current information and believes that 
the policy of sanctions imposed over the last 11 years has harmed Iraqi children; 
believes that the current energy deployed aggressively should be re-deployed into 
genuine diplomacy to seek peaceful solutions to disagreements based on mutual 
respect; considers that the achievement of a viable Palestinian state would represent 
the most significant contribution towards peace throughout the Middle East, and 
finally believes that Scotland&#146;s links with the USA can only remain meaningful 
and sincere if it has the courage to express such misgivings over US international 
policy when required.</A>&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Dennis Canavan*,
