<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7528 Bill Wilson: Public Sector Pay Ratios</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Will Hutton&rsquo;s recommendation that top pay in public sector bodies should not exceed a certain multiple of the lowest pay in those bodies; believes that the ratio of 20:1 could be regarded as a starting point and should be made mandatory for all bodies receiving public money immediately and then progressively reduced; agrees with Mr Hutton&rsquo;s reported remarks that a maximum pay ratio would demonstrate fairness by reassuring public opinion, address a problem of collective action across remuneration committees and benefit organisations&rsquo; productivity; believes that there is little evidence that extremely high pay is justified by performance, and encourages the private sector to similarly curtail the pay of top earners in light of evidence of the damaging nature of economic inequality on society presented by, amongst others, the Equality Trust and the National Centre for Research Methods at the University of Southampton.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7527 Rob Gibson: Celebrate Scotland&rsquo;s Songs Resource</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the creation and launch of the Scotland&rsquo;s Songs learning resources on the Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) website, which makes a large collection of 130 Scots and Gaelic songs and tunes from across the nation, including full lyrics and musical notation, freely available to all Scottish classrooms; further notes that Scotland&rsquo;s Songs allow for teachers to easily incorporate Scottish musical education into their teaching practice, which further supports the implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence, and encourages and supports all of the schools in Scotland to include Scotland&rsquo;s Songs as a key part of all students&rsquo; educational experience at all levels.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7526 Alex Neil: Property Factors (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Property Factors (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7525 Jackie Baillie: Preventing Sexually Transmitted Infection</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the continuing increase in the number of cases of genital warts reported by Health Protection Scotland and NHS Information Services Division; notes the support of professional and patient organisations including fpa, the Terence Higgins Trust, the Royal Society for Public Health, the Medical Foundation for AIDS and Sexual Health and the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV for the introduction of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to help protects against cervical cancer and genital warts that is already used across mainland Europe, and calls on the Scottish Government and NHS Scotland to ensure that they bring their influence to bear to ensure that decisions taken at UK level that affect the HPV vaccination programme in Scotland take into account the opportunity offered by a quadrivalent vaccine to prevent both cervical cancer and genital warts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7524 Mike Pringle: Edinburgh&rsquo;s Bus Drivers Keep the City Moving</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the skill and dedication of Edinburgh&rsquo;s bus drivers who continue to keep the city moving despite what it considers to be exceptionally heavy snow, freezing temperatures and hazardous road conditions, and believes that, without them, the city of Edinburgh would be at a virtual standstill.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7523 Ken Macintosh: Action for Sick Children in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the work of Action for Sick Children (Scotland) in raising awareness of the needs and rights of ill children and young people; calls on all children and young people&rsquo;s healthcare rights to be upheld in line with the European Association for Children in Hospital Charter; recognises the need to empower and support young people to take responsibility for their own health and management of their chronic condition; shares the belief that every sick child or young person has the right of equal access to education whenever they are well enough to learn, regardless of where they live; expresses concern at the reported wide variation in educational support that is available to children in hospitals and asks ministers to collect and collate information nationally on where and when hospital teaching is provided and on how many days a child has to be off sick before a teacher starts helping them at home, and, in light of this, calls on the Scottish Government to review the national guidance on absence due to ill health.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7522 Bill Wilson: The UK&rsquo;s Special Representative for Trade and Investment&rsquo;s Apparent Support for Corruption</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Prince Andrew&rsquo;s reported comments railing at British anti-corruption investigators, who had had, according to the remarks attributed to him, &quot;the idiocy to almost scuttle the al-Yamama deal with Saudi Arabia&quot;; believes that several regimes that it considers to be corrupt and undemocratic have been supported and sustained by the actions of companies based in the United Kingdom and its allies, and that defending corruption for the sake of profit reflects badly on the values of the UK and of the royal family; believes that this is damaging to the interests of UK citizens and those of other countries; considers that this increases political tensions in the latter, impedes their development and is conducive to human rights abuses and terrorism, and calls on the UK Government to investigate these allegations and, if found to be true, to cease to use Prince Andrew as a special representative for trade and investment.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7521 Sandra White: Lifeline for Older People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Age Scotland&rsquo;s campaign to safeguard what it considers to be vital public services that older people rely on; considers that free personal care and concessionary travel not only save money for older people but contribute towards improving their quality of life while delivering financial savings across other budget lines, and agrees with Age Scotland that, despite difficult financial times, these key public services should remain priority areas of spending for the Scottish Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7519.1 David Whitton: The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7519) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from first &quot;further&quot; to end and insert &quot;; notes that the Scottish Government chose to cut the budgets of enterprise and tourism this year even though the Scottish budget was going up; notes that Scotland&rsquo;s unemployment levels are now higher than that of the UK; calls on members to support a Scottish future jobs fund to help young people get in to work, and calls on the UK Government to base the green investment bank in Edinburgh.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7519.2 Jim Mather: The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7519) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from &quot;reform&quot; to end and insert &quot;build sustainable economic recovery; notes the work already undertaken by the Scottish Government on reforming the Enterprise networks and decluttering the delivery landscape, reducing duplication and driving up effectiveness and efficiency; further notes the ongoing Inquiry by the Economy, Enterprise and Tourism Committee on the Enterprise Network and the contribution it is making, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider its conclusions.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7519.2.1 Gavin Brown: The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-7519.2) in the name of Jim Mather, insert at end &quot;; calls on the Scottish Government to pay particular focus to improving Scotland&rsquo;s record on exporting and internationalisation of businesses, and also calls on the Scottish Government to focus on improving the business start-up rate.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7507 Robert Brown: Silently Stressed, NUS Scotland&rsquo;s Research on Student Stress</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the recent report from NUS Scotland on student stress, <em>Silently Stressed: a survey into student mental wellbeing,</em> which reported that student stress is on the rise, with over 90% of students feeling very stressed by examinations, 70% feeling very stressed by financial hardship and 50% feeling stressed while working in a paid job; is particularly alarmed that 40% of student counselling services surveyed were unable to meet demand from the student community and calls on Universities Scotland to ensure that student welfare and support services are adequately resourced to meet the reported increase in student stress; notes that over 80% of students surveyed felt that stigma around mental illness prevented them from seeking help, and calls for more work to be carried out on how the barrier of stigma can be overcome in encouraging students to come forward early to seek support for stress.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7507.1 Patrick Harvie: Silently Stressed, NUS Scotland&rsquo;s Research on Student Stress</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7507) in the name of Robert Brown, insert at end &quot;considers that the UK Government&rsquo;s proposal to burden students with up to an estimated &pound;50,000 debt by the end of their courses will only add to the stress that students experience and will harm their mental health as well as limiting their career choices and undermining the position of higher education in society, and urges the Scottish Government to reject any similar proposals in Scotland and instead to commit to the state&rsquo;s continued role in funding higher education in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7197 Kenneth Gibson: Pilot Island Fuel Discount Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the UK Government for its plans to introduce a pilot island fuel discount scheme; expresses concern at the exclusion of Arran from this scheme, despite petrol costs on the island being among the highest in Scotland; believes this to have been an oversight rather than a deliberate omission, and therefore urges the UK Government to include Arran in the pilot.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7197.1 Charlie Gordon: Pilot Island Fuel Discount Scheme</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7197) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, insert at end &quot;and the Scottish Government to include it in the Road Equivalent Tariff pilot.&quot;</p>
