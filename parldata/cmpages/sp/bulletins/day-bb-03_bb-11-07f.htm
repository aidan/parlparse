          <p><strong>*S2M-570#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Abuse 
            of Older People</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament recognises that 
            around one in ten older people in Scotland have been victims of various 
            forms of elder abuse; congratulates Age Concern Scotland&#8217;s elder 
            abuse project on its work in attempting to raise awareness of this 
            problem and, in particular, supports its interactive forum theatre 
            events, which will lead to breaking the silence on elder abuse in 
            our communities; hopes that this unique approach to tackling the very 
            sensitive subject of the abuse of older people will lead to its greater 
            recognition, and believes that the Scottish Executive should take 
            action to reduce the level of elder abuse and to ensure that victims 
            of abuse have access to appropriate support and legal remedies.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-569#</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Economic 
            Potential of the Renewable Energy Industry</strong>&#8212;That the 
            Parliament recognises the outstanding economic potential presented 
            by the renewable energy industry, not only in the field of wind power 
            but also through other forms of energy such as biomass and wave power 
            and further recognises that, if the Scottish Executive is to meet 
            all of its renewable energy targets, it needs to do all it can to 
            encourage all forms of renewable energy so that the market is there 
            to support future projects.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-568</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>A80 
            Appraisal</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should undertake a full appraisal of the costs and benefits 
            of both the A80 upgrade and the alternative Kelvin Valley route for 
            a new motorway, including a comparison between the economic and environmental 
            impacts of both options, and recognises the importance to the Scottish 
            economy of making a timeous decision.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-567</strong> <strong>Mr Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Gar-Ling 
            Ng</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament congratulates Gar-Ling Ng, a 
            student from Torry in Aberdeen studying at Aberdeen University, on 
            being named the UK&#8217;s most enterprising student at the recent 
            Shell Technology Enterprise Programme Awards 2003 as a result of her 
            new design idea for an oil pipeline cleaner.</p>

            Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 Amendment (Scotland) Order 2003</strong>&#8212;That

            Development in Education</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament acknowledges

            development; commends Education 21, a joint forum, including educationalists, 
            non-government organisations, businesses, local authorities, agencies
