<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2292</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Edinburgh Cyrenians</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh Cyrenians on 40 years of helping to inspire and shape Scotland&rsquo;s world leading approach to tackle homelessness; welcomes the recognition of the report from the charity New Philanthropy Capital which described the Cyrenians as standing out in its sector with a professional and committed management team; acknowledges the contribution of over 100 supported volunteers, themselves with backgrounds of homelessness, and supports the work of the Cyrenians in tackling social exclusion through better housing, employment, improved health and wellbeing, re-engagement with family and friends and community involvement and by helping to bring people back from the margins of society into a better quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2291</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Sense Over Sectarianism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the summer holiday project for Primary 7 pupils from Coatbridge and Airdrie, to be delivered by Albion Rovers Football Club, Strathclyde Police, beCogent and Sense Over Sectarianism; recognises the benefits of providing children with a chance to develop skills in a number of activities including sports, arts, drama, comedy and film making; considers that the project offers a unique opportunity for all local children who are departing primary school to tackle anti-sectarian attitudes and behaviour in a fun and interactive way, and acknowledges the importance of engaging with our young people to ensure that they enter secondary school with a better understanding of the issue of sectarianism in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2290</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Back on the Buses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the U-turn by Labour-controlled Glasgow City Council by reversing its previous ill-considered and dangerous move to withdraw school buses from children who live between two and three miles from their secondary school and praises the part played by Glasgow&rsquo;s <em>Evening Times </em>newspaper in this U-turn by bringing the issue to the public&rsquo;s attention, by the 10 SNP MSPs who have so far supported motion S3M-2245 demanding that Labour&rsquo;s plans be halted, by every Glasgow SNP councillor who voted against these plans in February and opposed them again at full council on 26 June 2008 and of course, most importantly, by the parents of Glasgow, including the parents in the Glasgow Milton area, who were not prepared to be dictated to by the Labour council and have their children&rsquo;s safety and education put at risk.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2245</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Save Glasgow&rsquo;s School Buses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of Labour-led Glasgow City Council to alter the distance for which free school bus travel is provided from two miles to three miles, which will affect around 1,500 school children; notes that this move was voted through in February 2008 in the face of fierce objections from SNP opposition on the council and that the move will save &pound;670,000, which is totally unnecessary as the council estimates a growth in its reserves from around &pound;10.7 million under the previous administration to around &pound;30 million under the current SNP government; condemns the decision of the council only to publicise this decision in the run-up to the summer holidays in what appears to be a deliberate ploy to prevent opposition campaigns by local parents against this ill-considered move; believes that the comments of Labour Councillor, Gordon Matheson, gives the game away when he stated that the council is falling into line with &quot;national guidelines&quot; but fails to point out that these are non-statutory and were drawn up under the previous administration in 2003; is concerned that these moves may put at risk child safety and school attendance; demands that the council stops using the city&rsquo;s school children as a political football; believes that the proposals should be halted and that the council should use next year to fully consult parents across all Glasgow&rsquo;s schools to ensure that children can get to school safely and easily, and, in the meantime, wishes local parents who are campaigning against the council&rsquo;s plans, such as those in Glasgow Milton, every success in their campaign.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2244</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Glasgow City Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow City Council on its findings that 72% of Glaswegians would be better off under local income tax as opposed to the unfair council tax, and believes that, given the persistent high levels of multiple deprivation in Glasgow under successive UK Governments, the introduction of a local income tax would contribute substantially to combating poverty in Glasgow and consequently would also combat poverty in all other areas of Scotland, both urban and rural, experiencing high levels of poverty.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>S3M-2233.1</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>The Future of Scotland&rsquo;s Universities</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2233) in the name of Claire Baker, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that six of the 13 Scottish universities listed who were listed last year have improved their placings while two have retained the place that they held last year; acknowledges the excellent work of the universities and their staff; notes that this improvement has come about over a period of renewed confidence in Scotland and improved co-operation between the universities and the Scottish Government, and calls on the SNP government to continue its excellent work with Scotland&rsquo;s universities.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2164.1</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Irish Reject the Lisbon Treaty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2164) in the name of John Lamont, leave out from &quot;it is&quot; to end and insert &quot;, unlike the United Kingdom, the Irish constitution requires that the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty is put to a referendum and that every party represented in the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann except Sinn F&eacute;in officially campaigned in favour of a &quot;Yes&quot; vote; further notes the comments of the Taoiseach, other political leaders and commentators in the Republic of Ireland, that the &quot;No&quot; vote was heavily influenced by domestic matters rather than just the Lisbon Treaty itself, and believes that the comments of Conservative MPs and MSPs, in criticising the UK for being among the 26 out of 27 EU member states not holding a referendum on the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, highlight hypocrisy and opportunism by David Cameron and his party, given that while in power the Conservative Party never once held a referendum on the ratification of any of the treaties of the European Union or its predecessors including the Treaty of Rome itself, the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, all of which were much more significant in terms of increasing the powers and scope of European institutions.&quot;</p>
