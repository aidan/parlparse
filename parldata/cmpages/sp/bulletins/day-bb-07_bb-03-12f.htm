<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5726#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Crichton Campus and the University of Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the work to develop an academic strategy for higher and further education in Dumfries and Galloway but, conscious that the failure of the University of Glasgow to recruit an intake of new undergraduates at the Crichton Campus in Dumfries this year may prejudge the outcome of that strategy, considers that the Scottish Executive should take all necessary steps to ensure that recruitment is resumed for the current year.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5725#</strong> <strong>Karen Gillon:</strong> <strong>Malawi</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the partnership that has been established between Scotland and Malawi and, in particular, the historic co-operation agreement signed by the Scottish Executive and the Government of Malawi; congratulates the wide range of schools, churches and civic organisations in Clydesdale that are involved in joint work with similar groups in Malawi, and believes that MSPs should sign up to the Scotland Malawi Partnership&rsquo;s pledge in advance of the election to ensure that this mutually beneficial partnership continues.</p>
<p>Supported by: Dr Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Cathy Jamieson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-5724</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Real Nappy Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch on Sunday 11 March 2007 of Real Nappy Week, an annual event to encourage the use of real nappies, to engage with parents and to enable them to make informed choices about the nappies that their babies use; congratulates, in addition to the coordinators of Real Nappy Week, the Women&rsquo;s Environmental Network (WEN), and the sponsors, Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), the many parents across Scotland who have chosen to use real washable nappies instead of disposables; notes that across the United Kingdom some eight million disposable nappies go to landfill each day, where they will remain for years, and that this represents a serious environmental issue as well as a waste of the resources used in the manufacture of the nappies; further notes therefore that, in addition to the&nbsp;financial savings of around &pound;500 per child, there are also very significant environmental benefits to be gained through the use of real nappies instead of disposables, and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase the resources available to local authority-run real nappy voucher schemes and to encourage across Scotland the use of real nappies in the interests of parents and children now and in the future.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5722&diams; </strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Bid to Increase Financial Limits for Small Claims</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the work of colleagues at Westminster who have ensured that there is pressure on the banking sector and commends the decision by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) last year to limit customer charges by credit card providers; notes recent developments taking place across the United Kingdom with regard to penalty charges being reclaimed by thousands of bank customers who continue to make successful claims; regrets that in very many cases constituents <em>in Dunfermline and</em> across Scotland are being compelled to take out claims in the sheriff courts to conclude their cases against their banks; expresses serious concern that the claims are adding considerable pressures to the workload of the sheriff courts; hopes that the Scottish Executive will urgently examine the pressure on Scotland&rsquo;s sheriff courts and deliberate carefully on the fact that many constituents are being seriously disadvantaged by the fact that the court system, with the limits of &pound;750 for small claims actions and &pound;1,500 for summary cause actions, has prevented thousands of them legitimately reclaiming significant sums of money from the banks across Scotland which have made record profits in the last year; considers that the Executive should urgently revisit the decision to limit small claims to &pound;750 and summary cause claims to &pound;1,500, recognising that these limits have not changed for more than 10 years; believes that the Executive should reflect on the fact that, if it does not act without delay, it will actively prevent many claimants across Scotland from reclaiming money illegally taken from their accounts; hopes that the Executive will seek meetings with the OFT as a matter of urgency to ensure that in the preparation of the report on which the OFT is currently working it will address the concerns of constituents and the situation in respect of Scotland&rsquo;s banks, and finally congratulates the Penalty Charges Forum, which has worked voluntarily, professionally and tirelessly to ensure that single parents, nurses, youth leaders, students and many others have returned to them some of the illegal charges which have been withdrawn from their bank accounts without their authorisation in the pursuit by banks to ruthlessly maximise their profits.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5721</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Future of the Digital Spectrum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposals for the disposal of the digital spectrum, largely by sale to the highest bidder, when it is released as a result of the cessation of analogue television; is concerned about the inadequacy of proposed safeguards regarding its future use; notes that, among the potential uses of this digital dividend, there are many which have significant implications for devolved issues, particularly for the cultural content of programming, for news coverage of Scottish current affairs, for Scottish creative industries and for other aspects of the Scottish economy; further notes that there is great potential for use of the digital spectrum at a more localised level, and believes that the digital dividend should be used to strengthen and extend the public service use of the spectrum by ensuring that capacity is reserved on digital multiplexes throughout Scotland to enable the growth of local and new Scottish television channels.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5718</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Hospital Car Parking Charges - a Pay Cut for NHS Staff?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses great concern about the motives behind car parking charges for hospitals since they penalise NHS staff who have to use their cars to travel to work; notes that, for example, at the Southern General employees are charged double rates (&pound;6 to &pound;12) if they park for more than seven hours in a day; expresses concern that, because charges are only levied during the day, daytime employees will spend up to &pound;2,700 per annum out of their salaries on parking, causing implications for recruitment, retention and morale of existing staff, and calls for the elimination of these charges, which equate to a pay cut for daytime staff only, and for a review of car parking charges for staff which are at present at variance throughout Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5713</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Concerns over &quot;Son of Star Wars&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses in the strongest possible terms its grave concern and condemnation of recently reported secret lobbying by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to have the US missile defence system known as &quot;son of Star Wars&quot; based in Britain, in light of the wide opposition in Scotland to the replacement of Trident and the intransigent position of the UK Government on this issue; believes that, as a peaceful nation, Scotland wishes to send a clear message to the rest of the world that it is fiercely opposed to these talks and the wider implications that any future &quot;son of Star Wars&quot; would have on world security, and urges the Scottish Executive to state its opposition to the &quot;son of Star Wars&quot; and allay any fears that people may have that this missile system could be based in Scotland by issuing an assurance that it will do everything in its power to ensure that this system will never be based in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-5691</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Rural Postcodes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Parcelforce imposes a separate regime of charges for the Highlands and Islands which it classifies as Zone 2, while England, Wales and other parts of Scotland are in Zone 1; further notes that these charges are considerably higher in Zone 2 than in Zone 1; notes with concern that, in response to Aviemore and Vicinity Community Council pursuing this issue, Jim Fitzpatrick MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Employment Relations and Postal Services at the  Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has indicated that he approves of these extra charges; considers that the UK Government therefore acquiesces in the higher charges imposed for one area of the United Kingdom, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Parcelforce and to the DTI to end this discriminatory treatment.</p>
