          <p><strong>S1M-2993</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Prison 
            Estates Review</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the publication 
            of the consultation paper <em>Proposals for the Future of the Scottish 
            Prison Service Estate</em>; believes that to help achieve a safer Scotland 
            the prison estate should facilitate the secure holding of prisoners 
            and the delivery of effective rehabilitation programmes, and that 
            prisons should provide a reasonable standard of accommodation; recognises 
            that these objectives can only be achieved by substantial modernisation 
            of the present prison estate, and encourages all interested individuals 
            and organisations to contribute to the current consultation. </p>

                private prisons have serious deficiencies in their management 
                of both inmates and staff, and asserts that, in the interest of 
                public safety, such a key component of the criminal justice system 
                should remain in the public sector.&quot; </p>

                work degree; further notes that difficulties in recruiting social 
                workers are expressed as a serious concern by the majority of 
                local authorities in Scotland; regrets the absence of a recruitment 
                campaign such as has been launched in other parts of the UK and 
                deplores the lack of strategy which will address the poor public 
                image of the profession, review the pay and conditions of social 
                workers, increase flexibility in job opportunities to aid retention, 
                develop positive initiatives to support front line staff or encourage 
                secondment, and concludes that the Executive is merely posturing 
                on this issue and neither acknowledging the crisis nor addressing 
                the critical issues with real commitment. </p>
              <p> <strong>S1M-2994.2</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Social Care 
                Workforce Development</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2994) 
                in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from second &quot;the 
                work&quot; to end and insert &quot;with concern the workforce's 
                increasing difficulty in carrying out these tasks owing to poor 
                levels of staffing, increased bureaucracy and additional demands 
                on what was already an over-stretched workforce, and therefore 
                calls upon the Scottish Executive to redouble its efforts to secure 
                an appropriately staffed and trained social care workforce which 
                is capable of carrying out its necessary functions. </p>
