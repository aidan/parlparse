<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong><a name="end" id="end"></a>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>S3M-36</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>Making Every Vote Count</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the achievement of securing proportional representation through a system of single transferable votes (STV) for the 2007 local government elections and the resulting transformation of local governance in Scotland; notes with concern the number of spoiled ballot papers for the Scottish Parliament elections and that these significantly exceeded those for the local government elections; believes that there should be the same voting system for the Scottish Parliament as there is for local government and that STV represents the fairest system of election; notes the further benefit of having one system of election for all levels of government in improving public confidence in the electoral system, and therefore calls on the UK Parliament to amend the Scotland Act 1998 to replace the use of the additional member system with a new system of proportional representation using single transferable votes in multi-member constituencies in all future Scottish Parliament elections.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-35</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong> <strong>Cleaner Coal Technology Feasibility Study</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by ScottishPower of a feasibility study into converting Cockenzie and Longannet power stations to cleaner coal technology; welcomes the fact that investment in new supercritical turbines and boilers could cut carbon emissions at the two stations by 20%; notes the flexibility that coal-fired plants provide as part of a diverse energy mix, and welcomes the consideration of extended life-spans for Cockenzie and Longannet, which could secure continuing employment for hundreds of skilled workers in East Lothian and Fife and help to maintain those counties&rsquo; contribution to Scotland&rsquo;s baseload energy needs and address climate change.</p>
<p>Supported by: Pauline McNeill, Kenneth Gibson, Claire Baker, Charlie Gordon, Brian Adam, John Park, Rhona Brankin</p>
<p><strong>S3M-34</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Closure of Bath Press Ltd, Blantyre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to offer what support it can to the people who will lose their jobs as a result of the closure of Bath Press Ltd in Blantyre; recognises that this closure represents a real loss to the community of Blantyre, and encourages the Executive to work with other agencies to bring other businesses into the area so that new, local employment opportunities can be created.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-33</strong> <strong>Iain Gray:</strong> <strong>Opposition to Ship-to-Ship Oil Transfer in Firth of Forth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament opposes proposals by SPT Marine Services to transfer oil between ships in the Firth of Forth; expresses concern over the company&rsquo;s role in the spillage of 35,000 gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico; notes the European Commission&rsquo;s view that the transfer of oil between vessels is &quot;a complex technical operation entailing a considerable risk of oil being spilt into the sea&quot;; further notes the European Commission&rsquo;s response to question E-0982/07 from Catherine Stihler MEP that &quot;a project or plan that will adversely affect a special area of conservation can only be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest and in the absence of alternative solutions&quot;; does not believe that these conditions have been met, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should take steps to protect the Firth of Forth by ensuring that these ill-conceived plans do not come to fruition.</p>
<p>Supported by: Elaine Murray, Claire Baker, John Park, Rhona Brankin, Malcolm Chisholm</p>
<p><strong>S3M-33.1</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Opposition to Ship-to-Ship Oil Transfer in Firth of Forth</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-33) in the name of Iain Gray, insert at end &quot;recognises that, as a result of discussions between the Green Party and the SNP, the Executive has the tools at its disposal to take action on this issue, which the previous Executive persistently did not take, and welcomes this development as an example of the co-operation which will become possible if all parties in the Parliament bring a constructive approach to their work.&quot;</p>
