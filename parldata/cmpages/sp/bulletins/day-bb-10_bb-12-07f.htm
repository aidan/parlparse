<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7546</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Northern Isles Double Success in Scots Trad Music Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the double success for Orkney and Shetland in the MG ALBA Scots Trad Music Awards 2010, with the Orkney Traditional Music Project winning the Community Project of the Year award and the Shetland Folk Festival being chosen as the Event of the Year; believes that the awards reflect the strength and depth of the musical heritage of the Northern Isles, with young islanders taught by schemes such as the Orkney Traditional Music Project reaching high standards, which allow them to perform alongside the best musicians from far and wide at events such as the world-renowned Shetland Folk Festival, and congratulates everyone involved in the Orkney Traditional Music Project and the Shetland Folk Festival for what it considers their well-deserved awards along with all the other award winners and those shortlisted in a very strong competition across all categories.</p>
<p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7545</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Domestic Abuse. Together We Can Stop It</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid&rsquo;s new campaign, Domestic abuse. Together we can stop it, during the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence, 25 November to 10 December 2010; congratulates Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid on the launch of the campaign website, http://www.togetherwecanstopit.org/, and encourages widespread support for the campaign and its advocacy of 10 things you can do to stop domestic abuse.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7544</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Save Violence Against Women Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes what it considers the vital and much-needed support that the Scottish Executive has provided over the last decade to help sustain and develop support services such as rape crisis centres and women&rsquo;s aid groups; further notes that much of this support has been in the form of dedicated funding for services takling violence against women, including the Rape Crisis Specific Fund, the Children&rsquo;s Services Fund and the Violence Against Women Fund; believes that, if these funds do not continue, the impact on women and children across Scotland will be severe; welcomes the campaign by Rape Crisis Scotland and Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid to gather pledges to support and protect funding for these services, and encourages all MSPs to pledge their support.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7543</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>42% Better</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes publication of Friends of the Earth Scotland&rsquo;s report, <em>42% Better</em>, looking at the achievability of Scotland&rsquo;s climate targets; agrees with what it considers to be its key message that not only are the climate targets achievable but measures to tackle climate change can have significant social and economic benefits; in particular notes its conclusions that, by eliminating fuel poverty, an energy efficiency programme could prevent up to 180,000 cases of anxiety and depression each year, reduce the amount of time people are off work due to asthma and breathing problems by up to 25% and, when coupled with delivery of renewable heating systems, create 99,000 person-years of employment between now and 2020; further notes its findings that, by improving cycling rates, increased investment in active travel could save up to 1,672 lives a year, save a substantial chunk of the &pound;170 million NHSScotland spend each year tackling obesity and, through higher productivity and less ill health, save the Scottish economy an estimated &pound;23 million a year, and therefore calls on members to work together to strengthen the <em>Report on Proposals and Policies</em> to ensure that it gives the utmost confidence that Scotland will meet its climate targets while simultaneously delivering the maximum social and economic benefit to its people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7542&diams; </strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Bell Rock Lighthouse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 2011 marks the bicentenary of the Bell Rock Lighthouse situated off the coast of Arbroath, which is widely considered to be one of the seven wonders of the industrial world; welcomes what it considers the substantial investment made in the refurbishment of the Signal Tower museum in Arbroath, which will now focus on the history of this world-famous lighthouse, and wishes the community-led year-long celebration of the bicentenary, called the Year of the Light, every success in promoting Arbroath and its maritime history.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7541</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Clydesdale Community Initiatives Recognised in 2010 SURF Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Clydesdale Community Initiatives (CCI) on being highly commended in the Health and Employability Partnership category at the 2010 SURF Awards, organised by Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum (SURF), which is Scotland&rsquo;s independent regeneration network, and supported by the Scottish Government; notes that the judges said that they were greatly impressed with the outstanding commitment of CCI in providing real health and employability support to its client group, who are largely volunteers with particular health and social care needs and mental health issues; notes that CCI was the only project based in solely the South of Scotland region to be shortlisted for an award, and wishes all the organisations involved in the awards process every success for the future.</p>

<p>Supported by: Ms Wendy Alexander<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7539</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Lothian and Borders Police Festive Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament approves the Lothian and Borders Police festive role model campaign, which will target violence against women by seeking to make men think about how their actions influence their children; understands that all frontline police officers are set to wear a white ribbon during the festive period as new figures show that 5% of all annual domestic abuse incidents in the Lothians are reported between Christmas Eve and 4 January; further approves the support being offered by Hibernian and Heart of Midlothian football clubs, with the players wearing white ribbons at the New Year&rsquo;s Day derby match and a bluetooth message about the campaign being broadcast at Tynecastle stadium for fans to receive on their mobile phones; further notes that the campaign will also be featured in the Derby Day programme and highlighted on posters and postcards showing a father and son playing football with the slogan, You&rsquo;re his role model. Teach him violence against women is never OK, and wishes all campaigners supporting Rape Crisis Scotland and White Ribbon Scotland every success.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7538</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Noddsdale House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the replacement of the micro-hydro system at Noddsdale House in Largs by the Evans and Robertson family; notes that the previous system had run continuously since 1927, providing light to the house and estate cottages; congratulates Gilbert Gilkes &amp; Gordon Ltd on what it considers to be the significant engineering works undertaken by it to replace the old turbines with a modern 50KW turbine, which will provide heat, lighting and hot water for five local homes and export surplus output to the national grid, and believes that such schemes will help reduce reliance on fossil and other non-renewable fuels and should be encouraged wherever possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7537</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Every Single Woman, Equal Treatment for Women Seeking Asylum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Govan and Craigton Integration Network on the launch of its postcard campaign, which asks the UK Government to provide comparable standards of treatment and support for asylum-seeking women who have been subjected to domestic and sexual violence with that provided for women settled in the United Kingdom; notes that the artwork on the postcards has been created by refugee and asylum-seeker women; considers that it is unacceptable that women seeking asylum who have been victims of rape and domestic abuse, who are pregnant or who are in prison are denied the same level of care and treatment that is provided to other women; further believes that strategies to end violence against women should apply to all women, including asylum seekers, and supports Govan and Craigton Integration Network&rsquo;s efforts to secure this outcome.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7536</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Cot Death Trust Research Makes its Mark on the World</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that members of the Scottish Cot Death Trust attended the international meeting on cot death in Sydney, Australia, in October 2010; notes that delegates at the meeting accepted the trust&rsquo;s poster presentation and that the trust supported five research papers arising from work carried out by scientists in England, Australia and the United States of America; believes that this is quite an achievement for a small Scottish charity in its 25th anniversary year, and wishes the trust the very best of luck in its endeavours to tackle what it considers to be the scourge of cot death in Scotland and the world as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7535</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Leuchie House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Multiple Sclerosis Society of the continuation of Leuchie House for a period of at least six months; congratulates members of the Save Leuchie Campaign for what it sees as their considerable efforts; further congratulates Mairi O&rsquo;Keefe, the manager of Leuchie House for her work in bringing forward an alternative proposal to secure future provision for people with MS, and wishes her and the staff every success in gaining funding for the future.</p>
<p>*<strong>S3M-7547 Fiona Hyslop: Scotland Bill&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of the Scotland Bill in the House of Commons on 30 November 2010; notes that it is based on the recommendations of the Commission on Scottish Devolution, which were presented to the Parliament in June 2009, and supports the general principles of the Bill in conferring more powers and responsibilities on the Parliament; further notes that proposals in the Bill and the United Kingdom Government&rsquo;s Command Paper, <em>Strengthening Scotland&rsquo;s Future,</em> are intended to contribute to the implementation of these principles; recognises the significant nature of the proposals and the proposed new system of funding devolved government in Scotland and the need for the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise fully the Legislative Consent Memorandum, the Bill and accompanying documents, and looks forward to the report by the Scotland Bill Committee so that the Scottish Parliament can come to a decision on these proposals after ensuring they are in the interests of Scotland.</p>
