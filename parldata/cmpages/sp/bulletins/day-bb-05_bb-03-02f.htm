         <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2508</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Support for Tidal Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &pound;1 million funding awarded by the Scottish Executive towards the establishment of a tidal test centre at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney; recognises that it is vital to fund the speedy development and commercialisation of a range of renewable technologies in order to avert climate change and to capitalise on opportunities for home-grown Scottish enterprise; expresses its concern, however, that &pound;1 million represents a mere drop in the ocean, and calls for increased funding urgently for more development of tidal power in Scotland.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2507</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>School Meals and Our Children&rsquo;s Future</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that all serious nutritionists are predicting that obesity will double in Scotland over the next 10 years, causing a health crisis which will dramatically increase demand for health services and lower average life expectancy; therefore endorses the principle that radical action is required to tackle Scotland&rsquo;s diet-related health problems; believes that there can be no better use of Scotland&rsquo;s resources than to invest in our children&rsquo;s future, and congratulates the National Assembly for Wales and the city councils of Hull and Glasgow for their action in providing free breakfasts for all primary children and the councils for their further commitment to extending free, nutritious school lunches to all their primary school pupils.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2505</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>ISEA&rsquo;s Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is reminded of the valuable work of Independent Special Education Advice Scotland (ISEA) which, because of the failure of the Scottish Executive over the years to respond with funding for this most effective charity, led to a forced closure of its operations in March 2004 with over 1,200 clients on its books; notes that it has now reopened having secured &pound;90,000 from Comic Relief to fund a parliamentary liaison officer and a further &pound;124,000, both over three years, from the Big Lottery Fund for advocacy services, specifically for the new tribunal procedure under the Additional Support for Learning (Scotland) Act 2004; is concerned that an application for funding from the Executive of &pound;65,000 over three years for an ethnic minority worker has this week been rejected, and calls on the Executive to revisit this decision soon.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2502#</strong> <strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> <strong>Trial Reintroduction of the European Beaver</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s proposal for a trial reintroduction of the European beaver, a proposal which follows the successful reintroduction of the species in 24 other countries, and considers that the Scottish Executive should give serious consideration to issuing a licence for the trial so that it can be determined, in a controlled and properly monitored way, whether the benefits to the environment and tourism observed after previous reintroductions elsewhere can be replicated in a Scottish context without significant adverse effects on existing land uses.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2501</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Agent Orange</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the people of Vietnam in their decision to bring a civil law suit that seeks class action status, claiming that up to 4 million Vietnamese people suffered dioxin poisoning due to Agent Orange; condemns utterly the stance taken by the Dow Chemical Company and Monsanto to attempt to have this action dismissed; rejects totally the claim by Dow Chemical Company and Monsanto that there is no connection between Agent Orange and the health problems that it is known to cause; further rejects the idea that the lack of a law on corporate liability in the 1960s is any defence, and agrees to send a message of support and solidarity to the people of Vietnam in this case.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2500</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>No Smoking Day, 9 March 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 9 March 2005 is No Smoking Day; supports the efforts of the estimated 70% of smokers who wish to give up smoking, and, as part of that support, commits itself to introducing a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland by 2006 at the latest.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2499</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>The Old Racecourse in Ayr</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all involved in the campaign to conserve the Old Racecourse playing fields in Ayr; recognises the hard work and dedication involved in this campaign; acknowledges that this is a victory for communities and for the value that local people put into green space and common land; further recognises that this victory is a shining example to all communities in Scotland fighting to save their local environment, and supports the call for the Old Racecourse to be granted conservation status.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2498</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>International Self-Injury Awareness Day - 1 March 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports International Self-Injury Awareness Day on 1 March 2005; recognises that over 160,000 people in the United Kingdom have been recognised as suffering from this and that many more cases remain unknown; calls for greater awareness of this form of mental health problem, particularly in young people, and further calls for research to be conducted on quantifying the problem in Scotland and the development of guidelines for all health professionals, social workers, teachers and families on early recognition of the condition.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2497#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>TETRA Masts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates North Lanarkshire Council&rsquo;s planning committee for rejecting two applications to erect TETRA masts in Cumbernauld; agrees with the committee in asking for the burden of responsibility for considering the health risks of TETRA to be transferred to the Scottish Executive; believes that there is mounting evidence of serious health risks associated with TETRA and other forms of electro-magnetic radiation; notes that the applicant, O2, did not challenge the health evidence presented by the objectors and therefore believes that at least the precautionary principle should apply; considers that there should be a moratorium on the erection of these masts whether under current legislation planning permission is required or not; further considers that in future planning legislation health should always be admissible as a material consideration, and in the meantime encourages all local authorities to follow the example of North Lanarkshire by refusing to grant similar applications.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2496</strong> <strong>Mike Watson:</strong> <strong>Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s Gaelic Education Provision</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s decision to relocate the Glasgow Gaelic School and Nursery Class to a refurbished building on the site of the former Woodside Secondary School; recognises that this is in response to the continuing increase in demand by parents who want their children to be educated in the medium of Gaelic; notes that the new Glasgow Gaelic School will provide education for pupils aged 3 to 18 on an incremental basis; further notes the appointment of a Head Teacher, Depute Head Teacher (Primary) and Depute Head Teacher (Secondary) to oversee the organisation of the school for commencement in August 2006, and believes that this positive development, following the establishment of B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig in 2003 and the introduction of the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Bill in the Parliament, will help secure the future of Gaelic, part of Scotland&rsquo;s cultural heritage.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2495</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Referral at Stage 1</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government and Transport Committee be designated as lead committee, and that the Justice 2 Committee be designated as secondary committee, in consideration of the Licensing (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1.</p>
