<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Support Striking Public Sector Workers</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes the involvement of hospital workers in north Glasgow and 
firefighters across Scotland in strike action in pursuit of improved gradings, 
wages and working conditions and further notes the meeting taking place on Thursday 
21 November 2002, at 3:30pm in the Scottish Parliament&#146;s Committee Room 2 
at which striking hospital workers from north Glasgow will attend to present their 
case along with representatives of the fire brigades union and that a financial 
collection in support of these workers will be held.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3614</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Keith Harding: Levenmouth Drug and Alcohol Project</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates the Levenmouth Drug and Alcohol Project in Fife on 
successfully gaining Investors in People recognition following an independent 
assessment, especially as the commitment of staff and volunteers is so critical 
to providing the project&#146;s vision and services.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3613</STRONG> 
<STRONG>John Farquhar Munro: Skye Bridge Tolls</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
recognises that toll charges on the Skye Bridge of £5.70 for non-ticket book holders 
are vastly higher than other bridges; notes that the Napier University Transport 
Research Institute report <em>An Assessment of the Economic Impact of the Skye 
Bridge Tolls </em>shows that the tolls are having a negative effect on the Skye 
and Lochalsh economy, and calls for the tolls to be removed entirely or at least 
reduced in line with the toll regimes on other Scottish bridges.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3612#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Trish Godman: Tackling Under Age Drinking</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
commends the members of the Renfrewshire Council on Alcohol for their innovative 
and widely welcomed Young Persons Advisory Project which seeks to guide and educate 
young people and school children on the growing social, personal and health problems 
associated with underage drinking; notes that many of the youngsters that have 
attended the project's counselling programmes have benefited from their participation; 
further notes that they and their parents now have a greater awareness and a more 
sensible view of alcohol and its dangers; is pleased to see that there is growing 
interest in the project's work from as far away as the New Zealand Police, and 
believes that such initiatives dealing with alcohol and substance misuse amongst 
children and young people should receive appropriate support from the Scottish 
Executive.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3611#</STRONG> <STRONG>Helen Eadie: General Agreement 
on Trade in Services</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the Department 
of Trade and Industry (DTI) consultation on the General Agreement on Trade in 
Services (GATS); notes that GATS covers many areas that are within the Parliament&#146;s 
legislative competence, and believes that all interested parties across Scotland 
should submit their views to the DTI before the final date for submissions on 
3 January 2003.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3610</STRONG> <STRONG>Robert Brown: Carers' 
Rights Day - 3 December 2002</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes Carers&#146; 
Rights Day on 3 December 2002; pays tribute to the estimated 105,000 people in 
the Greater Glasgow area that act as carers to people that are sick, frail or 
disabled; applauds the efforts of Carers UK and local care organisations to support 
the position of carers, and calls on all levels of government to ensure that carers 
obtain all the benefits and support available to them. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3609</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Fitzpatrick: Vascular Disease in Elderly People and the Findings 
of PROSPER</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the findings of PROSPER, 
the prospective study of pravastatin in the elderly at risk, undertaken by a team 
of leading international scientists from the University of Glasgow, University 
College Cork, Ireland, and Universiteit Leiden, the Netherlands, and their examination 
of the hypothesis that pravastatin will reduce heart attack and stroke events 
in elderly subjects with existing vascular disease or at high risk of developing 
the condition, presented at the American Heart Association Conference on 18 November 
2002 in Chicago, USA; recognises that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause 
of death and disability in elderly people and is also a major contributor to cognitive 
decline and dementia, both important public health issues for medical care for 
older people; notes that, while the benefits of statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular 
events such as heart attack and stroke in middle age are already recognised, its 
value for citizens in the over&#150;70s age group had never previously been closely 
scrutinised, and calls on the Scottish Executive, working together with NHS boards, 
to assess the potential effects of a statin in reducing the risks of coronary 
heart disease, stroke and their consequences in patients at high risk aged 70 
and older, so that current vascular risk management strategies for the middle-aged 
might be extended to elderly people who currently represent the largest group 
of undertreated individuals in our communities. </P><P>Supported by: Alex Neil<STRONG>*</STRONG>,

an amendment to motion (S1M-3608) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, insert at end 
&quot;with the exception of provisions implementing the European Framework Decision 
on the European Arrest Warrant in the Extradition Bill which should be dealt with 
by the Scottish Parliament, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring forward 
legislation implementing the Framework Decision that reflects the particular nature 
of the Scottish legal system.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3602.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Alex 
Fergusson: Scottish Executive Response to Foot-and-Mouth Disease Inquiries</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3602) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;and 
welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;; regrets the late publication of the Scottish 
Executive&#146;s response to the inquiries and the curtailment of the debate on 
the issue; considers the response to be vague and urges the Executive to clarify 
its position on key issues such as the future use of vaccinations; calls on the 
Executive to produce clear evidence that it is working urgently with Her Majesty&#146;s 
Government to reduce the risk of importing infectious diseases, and seeks reassurance 
that the outcome of the inquiries will form the basis for continuing vigilance 
and regular updated contingency arrangements in the event of a future outbreak.&quot; 
</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3602.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Fergus Ewing: Scottish Executive Response 
to the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Inquiries</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
(S1M-3602) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;and welcomes&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;; welcomes the fact that the Scottish Parliament was able 
to deal with the foot-and-mouth crisis more efficiently than it was tackled in 
England; endorses many of the proposals contained within the Scottish Executive 
response to the inquiries but considers that insufficient progress has been made 
to tighten import controls; believes that emergency vaccination should be deployed 
in any future outbreak, that there should be a total transfer to Scotland of all 
necessary power to handle any such outbreak and that the continued application 
of the 20-day rule is creating significant difficulties for Scottish farmers and 
crofters, and considers that the restrictions on access to the countryside were 
retained for far too long and had a severe impact upon the rural economy of many 
parts of Scotland.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3601# Sabhal Mor Ostaig Awarded Queens
