          <p><strong>*S2M-648#</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>European 
            Chemicals Regulation</strong>-That the Parliament applauds WWF Scotland's 
            chemicals campaign; notes with serious concern mounting evidence that 
            suggests that hormone-disrupting chemicals and chemicals that persist 
            and bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife are linked to a range of 
            adverse physiological and mental effects, including effects on reproduction, 
            cancers, genital deformities and neurological and developmental problems; 
            considers that exposure to such chemicals in the environment must 
            be reduced to protect human health and the environment; notes the 
            importance of the Parliament reaching a view on the proposed new European 
            Union (EU) chemicals legislation known as REACH, carrying out an inquiry 
            into the matter and making its view known to the UK Parliament and 
            the EU, and in the meantime considers that the EU and UKRep should 
            support the strongest possible controls on endocrine-disrupting chemicals 
            and the phasing out of hazardous and potentially harmful chemicals 
            in favour of safer alternatives where they are available.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-647#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Access 
            to Children's Therapy Services in North East Scotland</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with great concern the problems facing children 
            with special needs in Aberdeenshire and elsewhere with regard to accessing 
            vital physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy 
            and orthotics; further notes the difficulties of recruiting speech 
            and language therapists in the north east of Scotland and that the 
            speech and language therapy training courses are located in the central 
            belt and are oversubscribed; further notes that those staff currently 
            in place do a tremendous job given the strain that they are being 
            placed under, and considers that the Scottish Executive should (a) 
            make greater funding available for these courses, (b) promote the 
            location of a speech and language therapy training course in the north 
            east, (c) provide funding for training and employment of additional 
            orthotic staff and technicians in the north east and (d) provide additional 
            funding to NHS Grampian and Aberdeenshire Council to allow short-term 
            solutions to be quickly implemented to improve the immediate situation.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-646</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong><em>Holyrood</em>            Centenary</strong>-That
            the Parliament commends Paul Hutcheon and  the staff of <em>Holyrood</em> magazine
            for the excellent publication  that they have provided to MSPs and
            their staff over the last four 
            years; welcomes their commitment to lively and even-handed coverage
             of the Parliament; recognises the magazine's contribution to increasing
              the understanding of the Parliament, and sends them hearty congratulations
             
            on their 100th issue. <em><strong>R</strong></em></P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-644</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Muslim 
            Festival of Eid-Ul-Fitr</strong>-That the Parliament sends warm greetings 
            to Muslims across Scotland and around the world as they celebrate 
            the Festival of Eid-Ul-Fitr; joins them in honouring the promise of 
            harmony, peace, health and prosperity enshrined in Eid-Ul-Fitr; looks 
            forward to religious diversity and freedom in all countries, and recognises 
            the contribution of Muslim Scots to Scottish life and culture.</P>
