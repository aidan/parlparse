          <p><strong>*S2M-765#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Organ 
            Donation Opt-out System</strong>-That the Parliament believes that 
            it is time to introduce an organ donation opt-out system for Scotland 
            to try to address the ongoing shortage of organs donated within our 
            country, a shortage that leads to over 50 preventable deaths per year 
            and undermines the quality of life for hundreds of others as they 
            undergo medical treatment in the absence of available and healthy 
            organs for transplants, and believes that such an organ donation opt-out 
            system should be introduced with maximum safeguards to ensure maximum 
            choice and information to all in Scotland who may wish, for whatever 
            reason, to opt out of organ donation but at the same time believe 
            that it is important to encourage organ donation as a life-saving 
            and enhancing act of humanity.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-764#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Business 
            Rate Relief for Community Amateur Sports Clubs</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the recent announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer 
            regarding a minimum 80% relief from business rates for registered 
            community amateur sports clubs and believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should ensure that such relief is extended to registered community 
            amateur sports clubs in Scotland.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, 
            Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Elaine Smith<strong>*</strong>, 
            Dr Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S2M-763</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Health 
            of Dockyard Workers</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to enter into discussions with the Ministry of Defence and 
            Fife NHS Board on the possibility of conducting a study into the potential 
            ill health effects of exposure to radiation suffered by people while 
            employed at Rosyth Dockyard in order to establish if there is any 
            link between their exposure to radiation while employed at the dockyard 
            and any ill health they have suffered and, if deceased, any link between 
            their employment and cause of death.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-762.1</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> 
            <strong>Delivering a Quick, Effective Youth Justice System</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-762) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert 
            at end; &quot;; in particular considers that at the heart of effective 
            youth justice is the Children's Hearings system; calls, therefore, 
            for the Children's Hearings system to be better resourced with a wider 
            range of disposals in order that hearings can perform a more effective 
            role in relation to youth justice and assist in the wider function 
            of community mediation, and further calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to alleviate the burden on the Children's Hearings system by sending 
            persistent 14 and 15-year-old offenders to youth courts, while keeping 
            16 and 17-year-olds in adult courts.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-762.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Delivering 
            a Quick, Effective Youth Justice System</strong>-As an amendment to 
            motion (S2M-762) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;however notes with concern the contents of 
            the Audit Scotland report, <em>Dealing with Offending by Young People</em>, 
            published in November 2003, that too many children placed on supervision 
            for reasons of offending are not receiving the required level of service 
            and considers that efforts to encourage rehabilitation and prevent 
            re-offending are being undermined as a result; further notes that 
            the shortage of places in secure units constrains the ability of children's 
            hearings to make the most appropriate decisions, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive must guard against complacency and redouble 
            its efforts to provide both the leadership and resources that will 
            enable its partners in local authorities and the voluntary and statutory 
            sectors to make the progress required to deliver an appreciable reduction 
            in youth crime&quot;.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-761.1</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Improving 
            Scotland's Homes</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-761) in the 
            name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to 
            end and insert &quot;notes the report of the Housing Improvement Task 
            Force; recognises that housing stock transfer to community-based housing 
            associations gives tenants far more say in the way their housing is 
            run, giving tenants greater rights and responsibilities, and therefore 
            believes that, to improve the standard of housing for everyone in 
            Scotland, it is necessary to step up the process of devolving control 
            of housing from local authorities to community-based housing associations, 
            housing co-operatives or a range of other providers to give tenants 
            a real choice of landlord and a real say in the management of their 
            homes.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-761.2</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Improving 
            Scotland's Homes</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-761) in the 
            name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;will&quot; to end 
            and insert &quot;and implementation will make a contribution to the 
            delivery of good quality, sustainable and affordable housing for all 
            in Scotland; notes, however, the net loss of 103,000 homes from local 
            authority housing stock since 1997; believes that such ongoing loss 
            is unsustainable, and calls for a replacement of the right to buy 
            scheme with a right to rent discount scheme to reward long-term tenants 
            while protecting local authority and housing association stock and 
            for the implementation of a programme of sustained investment in local 
            authority housebuilding to build at least 10,000 new units a year 
            to reverse the disastrous decline in the availability of affordable 
            social housing.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-761.3</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Improving 
            Scotland's Homes</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-761) in the 
            name of Ms Margaret Curran, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to bring forward a timetable for the implementation of the 
            task force recommendations and to ensure that the necessary resources 
            are made available for their implementation.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-761.4</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Improving 
            Scotland's Homes</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-761) in the 
            name of Ms Margaret Curran, insert at end &quot;but notes that the 
            report's recommendations are not in themselves sufficiently detailed 
            and therefore will require further guidance on their interpretation 
            and operation, along with adequate resourcing if the aspirations of 
            the task force are to be realised.&quot;</P>
