<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7992 Johann Lamont: Regeneration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of continued support from the Scottish Government for regeneration initiatives, particularly in the current economic climate; believes that it is essential for effective regeneration activity to be co-ordinated across the Scottish Government and local government and in communities; welcomes the many regeneration initiatives supporting local communities and sustained by local involvement across Scotland; recognises in particular the work of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust in Scotland as an organisation that has played a central role in supporting vital projects that have improved the quality of life for thousands of people living in former mining communities, has helped over 20,000 young people, supported over 2,000 people back into work and supported over 3,000 community initiatives and highlights the fact that every &pound;1 spent by the Coalfields Regeneration Trust generates &pound;1.37 of matched funding to support these important projects, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that funding for the Coalfields Regeneration Trust is sustained at existing levels during the next spending period.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7991 Patricia Ferguson: Missing People&rsquo;s Missing Rights Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Missing People&rsquo;s Missing Rights campaign, which offers a lifeline to those who run away and go missing each year and provides support for those left behind; notes that the campaign&rsquo;s aims seek to improve how families of missing people are supported following a disappearance; further notes that the Missing People charity provides its services in Scotland with the support of the People&rsquo;s Postcode Lottery; considers this to be an important issue, and commends the two organisations for working together to tackle it.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7990 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
<p>Groups 1 and 2: 20 minutes</p>
<p>Groups 3 to 6: 40 minutes</p>
<p>Groups 7 and 8: 1 hour 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7989 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman Act 2002 Amendment Order 2011 (SSI 2011/draft) be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7988 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Retention of Samples etc. (Children&rsquo;s Hearings) (Scotland) Order 2011 (SSI 2011/draft) be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7987 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (Amendment of Specified Authorities) (No.2) Order 2011 (SSI 2011/draft) be approved.</p>
