<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4591</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Ross and Cromarty Pipes and Drums School Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Ross and Cromarty Pipes and Drums School on winning the Novice/Juvenile competition of the North of Scotland Branch of the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association event at the Aberdeen Highland Games on Sunday 18 June 2006; notes that this victory was gained after competing against other Novice/Juvenile Bands and Adult Grade 4 Bands and that this is the first time that a Juvenile/Novice Band from outwith Aberdeenshire has won at the event in 10 years, and recognises this achievement as outstanding since the band have been performing for one year.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4585</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>PURE Hydrogen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the PURE project for its ground-breaking work to prove that renewable hydrogen and fuel cells are viable; believes that the partnership between PURE&rsquo;s renewable hydrogen and siGen&rsquo;s innovative hydrogen car is an inspiring demonstration of the future of environmentally sustainable transport; appreciates the enterprise and leadership shown by the Unst community in running the PURE project, and urges the Scottish Executive to increase its support for innovation towards a hydrogen economy in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4584</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Homeopathy Awareness Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 14 to 21 July 2006 is Homeopathy Awareness Week; recognises that homeopathy has been seen to provide benefits to the mental and physical well-being of patients and is based on a multi-disciplinary, holistic, &quot;whole-person care&quot; model; welcomes the contribution that homeopathic medicine makes to the NHS by successfully treating a wide range of conditions, often after conventional medicine has failed; acknowledges the excellent results achieved through the imaginative approach pioneered by the Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital, the only one of its kind in the United Kingdom, and wishes the hospital, its staff and patients every future success.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4583</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Draft Automated Registration of Title to Land (Electronic Communications) (Scotland) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Communities Committee recommends that the draft Automated Registration of Title to Land (Electronic Communications) (Scotland) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4582</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>UNICEF Award for Raigmore Midwives</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff in the maternity unit at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, supported by NHS Highland&rsquo;s Public Health Directorate, on their hard work in achieving the UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Hospital Award; notes the strong commitment made by NHS Highland to encourage and support breastfeeding and recognises that this award is a key component of action on breastfeeding; further notes that there are around 1,900 babies born at Raigmore every year and that at present over 60% of new mums at Raigmore are breastfeeding successfully, and wishes the whole maternity team at Raigmore Hospital well in its future efforts in supporting mothers and babies and promoting successful breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4581</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>North Sea Oil Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the shocking revelations contained in BBC Scotland&rsquo;s Frontline programme on 14 June 2006 with regard to safety practices in the UK North Sea oil industry sector; notes in particular that considerations of profit were allowed to supersede those of safety, not just on one-off occasions but continually, and that the concerns of workers, expressed via the Oil Industry Liaison Committee, the offshore workers&rsquo; union, were ignored by both the industry and the UK Government; commends Bill Campbell, former Shell International Group Auditor, on his bravery and integrity in blowing the whistle on the company for whom he had worked for 24 years and for exposing the dangerous malpractice that was allowed to flourish under the company&rsquo;s stewardship, and believes that the Parliament should examine the role of the Health and Safety Executive in this matter and consider why it apparently failed to act effectively.</p>
<p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4580</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Consequential Amendments) (Scotland) Order 2006 be approved.</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4577</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Passengers Before Profits - Greater Accountability in Public Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament reiterates its strong view that decent local bus services are vital to all Scotland&rsquo;s communities and its belief that such services are integral to cutting road congestion and safeguarding the environment; welcomes the significant investment in bus infrastructure, including better terminuses, priority bus lanes and fast track traffic management systems which have received Scottish Executive support throughout Scotland; expresses significant concern that withdrawal of services is continuing resulting in, for example, a much poorer after-hours service in Glasgow, undermining investment and attempts to deliver more integrated and accessible health care and other public services, as well as leaving many areas of both urban and rural Scotland without adequate services, and calls on the Executive and Transport Scotland, in return for the increased investment, to ensure greater accountability of the bus industry for services across Scotland, to undertake speedily a review of how quality bus partnerships are operating and to consider seriously all possible options which could prevent the loss or absence of vital services, including new and greater forms of regulation such as franchise agreements or allowing the new Regional Transport Partnerships the power to determine routes and timetables, so as to guarantee all Scottish communities the bus links which they need and deserve.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4576*#*</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Justice for Mesothelioma Sufferers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave concern at the House of Lords ruling on 3 May 2006 which means that compensation for mesothelioma sufferers will be cut and supports Lord Rodger&rsquo;s judgement that, no matter where an individual contracted the disease, they should receive a full payment, reflecting practice in the Scottish courts, and notes that the judgement will have a significant impact in Clydebank and the west of Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4550.1</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4550) in the name of Margaret Jamieson, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;does not agree to the general principles of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill and does not agree that the Bill should proceed as a Private Bill because the project will never attract enough passengers to justify the capital investment of &pound;160 million and a &pound;4 million annual subsidy, the single largest group of people using the trains by 2030 will, even after the planned significant growth of Glasgow Airport, continue to be commuters between Paisley and Glasgow, the reduction on car and taxi journeys on the M8 corridor between the airport and Glasgow city centre will peak at only 2% by 2012, 24% of airport passengers will arrive or depart when the trains are not running or are too late to be of help to them, the only direct services will be from Glasgow Central and Paisley Gilmour Street and the proposal as it stands is either an expensive commuter investment or an airport rail link on the cheap and as such could end up being an expensive &quot;white elephant&quot;.&quot;</p>
