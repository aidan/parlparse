          <p><strong>*S2M-1330</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> 
            <strong>64th Anniversary of the 51st Highland Division's Rearguard 
            Action at St Val&eacute;ry</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the sacrifice made by the 51st<SUP> </SUP>Highland Division in June 
            1940 as they assisted the French Army in making a stand against the 
            German invasion, relieving the pressure on the Channel ports, action 
            which ultimately lead to the capture of the division at St Val&eacute;ry-en-Caux; 
            further recognises that this action by the 51st Highland Division 
            helped win time for the Royal Navy to evacuate over 300,000 British 
            and French soldiers from Dunkirk; notes that, without the evacuation 
            from Dunkirk, Britain and her allies might well not have been able 
            to regroup and reorganise and ultimately return to French soil in 
            1944; recognises how different Britain, and indeed Europe, might have 
            been today without this vital contribution, and invites the First 
            Minister, when he takes part on behalf of the Scottish people in commemorative 
            activities to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day, to also pay tribute 
            to the 51st Highland Division's contribution to the evacuation from 
            Dunkirk and then ultimately to the success of D-Day.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1329#</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Affordable 
            Housing in North-east Fife</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the shortage of affordable housing for rent or sale in many 
            communities in north-east Fife; recognises that this is due to many 
            factors including the decline in the amount of public sector rented 
            accommodation, the popularity of many communities as retirement and 
            holiday locations and, in the case of St Andrews, the accommodation 
            needs of the growing student population; expresses its concern about 
            the difficulties faced by many people in trying to obtain affordable 
            accommodation in their own communities and the pressures on rural 
            services such as schools, and considers that Fife Council, Communities 
            Scotland and the Scottish Executive should develop an effective housing 
            plan for north-east Fife that addresses these concerns to ensure viable, 
            vibrant and sustainable communities throughout north-east Fife.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1328</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Abolition 
            of Prescription Charges</strong>-That the Parliament notes a recent 
            Teletext poll that asked for opinions on whether prescription charges 
            should be abolished in Scotland where 89% said &quot;yes&quot; and 
            11% said &quot;no&quot; and believes that the Scottish Executive should 
            follow the example of the National Assembly for Wales and abolish 
            this additional tax on ill-health.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1327</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>Sustainable 
            Management of Scotland's Marine Environment</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the considerable ecological, economic and social importance 
            of Scotland's marine environment; notes that the seas and oceans are 
            the theme of this year's United Nations World Environment Day on 5 
            June; acknowledges the range of initiatives already taken by the Scottish 
            Executive to protect and enhance all of Scotland's coastline and marine 
            waters, including the Partnership Agreement commitment to consult 
            on the options of establishing a national coastline park and marine 
            national parks; endorses the Executive's continued input to the United 
            Kingdom marine stewardship report process, to the development of a 
            European marine strategy and to OSPAR; welcomes the strong lead being 
            taken by the Executive to set out a clearer vision and more coherent 
            strategic framework for Scotland's marine environment in its recent 
            consultation paper, and supports the Executive's objectives of improving 
            the co-ordination of activity to support, and developing a mechanism 
            for, the future good governance and sustainable management of Scotland's 
            marine environment.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1326</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Health 
            Issues</strong>-That the Parliament notes that, despite a substantial 
            increase in funding for the NHS in Scotland, services for patients 
            have not improved over the last five years with fewer in-patient, 
            day case and out-patient treatments occurring and more patients waiting 
            longer for treatment; notes that, despite the best efforts of NHS 
            staff, the current monolithic, centrally-run system of providing healthcare 
            is not delivering the results our people are entitled to expect; recognises 
            that fundamental reform is needed of the NHS in Scotland to achieve 
            the standards of many other health services in European countries 
            and to provide value for money for our taxpayers, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to give patients genuine choice over the treatment 
            they receive, establish foundation hospitals within NHSScotland and 
            promote the development of the independent sector.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1325</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Hamilton 
            Football Club Promotion to First Division</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates Hamilton Academical Football Club on its promotion to 
            the Scottish Football League First Division and acknowledges the efforts 
            of the players, coaches and management in securing the promotion.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1324</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Netherdale 
            Campus Textile Design Course</strong>-That the Parliament condemns 
            the proposed transfer by Heriot-Watt University of the textile design 
            course from the Netherdale Campus to the Riccarton Campus; notes that 
            this proposed closure will affect mostly female students who make 
            up 80% of the course intake; congratulates the students of the Netherdale 
            Campus on their decision to hold a referendum on the proposed transfer, 
            and calls on the Vice-Principal, Professor John Simmons, and the Heriot-Watt 
            University Court to reconsider its decision at its meeting on 24 May 
            2004.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1323</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Ayr 
            Show</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of 
            the Ayr Show; notes that, despite poor weather, the show had an increase 
            of 20% in takings; further notes that visitor numbers were up with 
            a larger than normal number of townspeople attending; recognises the 
            role that shows such as this play in the rural life of Scotland, and 
            sends best wishes to all show winners.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1322#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Stockline 
            Plastics Disaster</strong>-That the Parliament offers its condolences 
            to all families and friends involved in the recent tragic disaster 
            at Maryhill; praises the expertise and hard work of all organisations 
            and individuals, including the NHS, in providing rescue services to 
            all involved in the Maryhill explosion; appreciates all offers of 
            expert help from outwith Scotland; is especially proud of hospitals, 
            such as Stobhill, that not only treated the walking wounded from the 
            explosion site but also took on board all medical and surgical emergencies 
            scheduled for Glasgow Royal Infirmary, thus allowing the hospital 
            to manage the acute cases from Maryhill; commends those who counselled 
            the bereaved relatives and friends, and acknowledges the impact of 
            such a tragedy on all involved, accepting the need to provide long-term 
            medical, surgical and emotional care.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1321#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Bearsden 
            Post Office Closures</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the announcement 
            by Post Office Ltd of its proposal to close three post offices in 
            the Bearsden area, in addition to the closure of the post office at 
            Killermont; considers that consultation time was not sufficient, given 
            that the Easter holiday break was within the period set for consultation; 
            acknowledges that the most vulnerable people in society will be affected 
            since the majority affected are elderly, few drive and there is a 
            paucity of public transport and guaranteed parking and therefore the 
            suggested alternative post office at Roman Road is not suitable as 
            it would require considerable adaptation to meet the needs of elderly 
            people; deplores the fact that communities surrounding the post offices 
            proposed for closure will be bereft of vital services, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should exert pressure on Post Office Ltd 
            to reconsider these closures, which are detrimental to the well-being 
            of an increasingly aging population.</P>
