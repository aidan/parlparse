<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>

<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7712 Robin Harper: Bookbug</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses regret that the Bookstart, Booktime and Booked Up programmes for children in England had to experience what it considers the trauma of being told that their funding would be cut by 100%, to then have the UK Government backtrack on its announcement; commends all those who campaigned in support of what it sees as these important programmes, without whom it believes the UK Government would have been content to deny children in England the invaluable service of Bookstart; believes that the Scottish Book Trust&rsquo;s early years programme, Bookbug, delivers an important and excellent start for all babies, toddlers and children throughout Scotland in encouraging them to enjoy books and to be read to by their parents and carers, and urges the Scottish Government to continue its funding for Bookbug in Scotland and avoid what it sees as the unnecessary missteps and u-turns experienced by its counterparts in England that were introduced by the UK Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7711 Joe FitzPatrick: Scottish Parliament V&amp;A at Dundee Exhibition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the V&amp;A at Dundee exhibition, which will be in the Main Hall from 17 to 27 January 2011; notes that the exhibition will showcase the six designs, which it considers were all outstanding, that were shortlisted for the V&amp;A at Dundee building competition, including the winning submission from Kengo Kuma and Associates; further welcomes the &pound;5 million of funding committed by the Scottish Government for the building of the V&amp;A; congratulates the project partners, Dundee City Council, the universities of Dundee and Abertay Dundee, Scottish Enterprise and the V&amp;A; believes that the partners have all been vital in ensuring that the project becomes a reality; notes that the project, expected to be completed in 2014, will create 900 jobs and bring an estimated 130,000 extra visitors to Dundee each year, and further notes that the museum will provide access to what it believes will be high-quality exhibitions for residents in Dundee and across Scotland by linking up with cultural centres in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow, making Scotland a global cultural destination.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7710 Fiona Hyslop: Historic Environment Amendment (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Historic Environment Amendment (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>

<p><strong>S3M-7706# Helen Eadie: Celebrating the Coalfields Regeneration Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament remembers that coal mines across the United Kingdom were closed during the 1980s and 1990s and considers that the effects were devastating not only to workers and their families but to their wider communities especially in Scotland in towns and villages such as Lochgelly, Cardenden, Kinglassie and Kelty where the scars run deep and have left an enduring regeneration challenge; celebrates the fact that in 1999 the Coalfields Regeneration Trust was formed as an independent charity operating on a UK-wide basis, funded in Scotland by the Scottish Executive, and is the only organisation dedicated solely to the social and economic regeneration of coalfield communities; further commemorates the efforts of miners across the centuries in helping to build Scotland into what it is today and, in recognition of their efforts, pledges to continue to do all that it can to say thank you to folk in those coal-mining communities whose harshness of life over the years entitles them to fulsome support, and would welcome a demonstration of gratitude on behalf of all of the people of Scotland by ensuring full financial support is given to the Coalfields Regeneration Trust in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7702 Mr Frank McAveety: Shettleston Scheme a Boost for Bookworms</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the success of Shettleston railway station&rsquo;s book swap initiative that is being led by the east-end based ticket officer, Michael Cochrane; believes that this initiative promotes reading and encourages engagement with the area&rsquo;s history; hopes that what it believes will be the increase in passenger numbers associated with the new direct service from the station to Edinburgh will help the project go from strength to strength, and considers that the success of this innovative scheme is further evidence of the unique role played by the east end in Glasgow&rsquo;s rich and diverse cultural experience.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7701&diams;   Jamie Hepburn: Possible Introduction of Car Parking Charges at Croy Railway Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of a new park-and-ride facility at Croy Railway Station in Central Scotland; considers this development to be long-overdue and believes that it will improve the travel and commuting experience for thousands of rail passengers in Croy, Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and beyond; notes that, in its submission to Transport Scotland&rsquo;s 2009 consultation on station car parking policy in Scotland, North Lanarkshire Council stated its position that &quot;station parking charges would probably only be required in town centres or other areas where they might be used by non-rail travellers.&quot;; therefore notes with concern reports that North Lanarkshire Council is considering the introduction of a daily charge for users of the facility; believes that a charge for use of the park-and-ride will have a negative economic impact on travellers who currently rely on the car park as part of their daily journey and would act as a disincentive for drivers who might otherwise choose to complete their journeys by rail via Croy Station, and believes that a consultation with station users on these plans would show a lack of support for car parking charges at Croy Railway Station.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7696&diams;   Brian Adam: Fuel Tax Price Increase Double Whammy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that fuel prices throughout Scotland have increased again due to the rise in VAT to 20% and an increase in fuel duty by the UK Government in January adding 0.76p to the price of a litre of petrol and diesel making diesel prices the second highest in Europe; notes that 62% of the cost of an average litre of diesel is tax as opposed to a European average of 49%; notes that in Aberdeen, despite its being known as Europe&rsquo;s oil capital, petrol and diesel prices in January were again over 130p per litre, which has increased costs for small businesses and the road haulage industry, which it considers have been forced to pass increases on to customers, contributing to rising inflation, and believes that cutting the cost of fuel by 10p per litre in Scotland would cost only about half of the estimated &pound;1 billion in extra revenue that the Treasury is set to take in as a result of rising oil prices.</p>
