          <p><strong>S1M-4071</strong> <strong>Angus MacKay: USDAW's Campaign 
            to Protect Shopworkers Against Violence and Abuse</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament is appalled at the number of incidents of violent attacks 
            on, and abuse of, shopworkers, as reported in the Scottish Retail 
            Consortium's Annual Crime Survey; notes with concern that last year 
            over 31% of shops in Scotland had at least one reported incident of 
            violence against a shopworker; further notes with concern that a survey 
            conducted by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) 
            revealed that over the last 12 months 47% of shopworkers had suffered 
            physical violence, 72% had been threatened and 86% had been verbally 
            abused; calls upon members of the Scottish Parliament to support USDAW's 
            <em>Freedom from Fear</em> campaign against violence and abuse of 
            shopworkers, and urges the Scottish Executive to make retail crime 
            a police key performance indicator and promote and resource town centre 
            and safer shopping partnerships.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-4070</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Scottish Settlement 
            for Fire Dispute</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the decision 
            of Her Majesty's Government to introduce a Fire Services Bill that 
            will impose a pay and conditions settlement on fire services staff 
            in England and Wales; recognises that by this action Her Majesty's 
            Government has effectively abandoned the United Kingdom negotiating 
            mechanism, and calls upon the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities 
            and the Fire Brigades Union in Scotland to enter into negotiations 
            to secure a fair and just settlement that can be presented to the 
            incoming Scottish Executive.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4069</strong> <strong>David Mundell: Chapelcross - The 
            World's Oldest Operational Nuclear Power Station</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that the Chapelcross Power Station will, from 
            the start of April, be the longest serving nuclear power station in 
            the world; further notes that Chapelcross has provided a safe and 
            reliable supply of electricity to the south of Scotland since 1959 
            and regrets that it will cease generation no later than 31 March 2005; 
            believes that the engineering and scientific accomplishments of designing, 
            building and operating Chapelcross and Calder Hall were the 20th century 
            equivalent of the Forth Rail Bridge or the invention of the steam 
            engine and congratulates the management and workforce on their skill 
            and dedication in operating successfully the Calder Hall and Chapelcross 
            power stations for a combined total of more than 90 years; further 
            notes the fudge and delay inherent in the Government&#146;s energy 
            white paper, and believes that the success of Chapelcross would be 
            best recognised by the early commissioning of a replacement nuclear 
            power facility on the same site.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Murray Tosh, Alex Fergusson, John Scott, Phil Gallie, 
            Mr Keith Harding</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4068</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Paisley Law 
            Centre</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the hard work of 
            the staff of the Paisley Law Centre, notes that at the end of December, 
            Paisley Law Centre was carrying a caseload of 489 open client files; 
            further notes that 47% of its client caseload during this period was 
            people facing eviction, 22% was involved in other miscellaneous house 
            disputes, 17% related to social security, mental health, community 
            care, criminal injuries and disability matters, 7% was involved in 
            disputes involving their employment and 5% related to assisting voluntary 
            organisations; believes that Paisley Law Centre offers a quality service 
            giving clients a high chance of achieving a successful resolution 
            to their problem and significantly helps in preventing homelessness 
            and tackling social exclusion and that many of its clients have children 
            living with them in their tenancies or are vulnerable due to ill health 
            or other reasons and a significant number would no doubt have been 
            evicted had they had no representation; supports the work of local 
            law centres, which provide such essential services to our communities, 
            and urges support for their development across Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4067</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Paisley, Scotlands 
            Largest Fairtrade Town</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            Fairtrade Fortnight 2003 from 3 to 17<sup> </sup>March 2003 was widely 
            observed in Scotland and welcomes the growing support for this annual 
            observance; congratulates the town of Paisley on meeting the five 
            criteria laid down by the Fairtrade Foundation for the holding of 
            Fairtrade town status, understanding that the five tests successfully 
            met by Paisley are a resolution from the local council supporting 
            Fairtrade and an agreement to serve Fairtrade coffee and tea at its 
            meetings, in its offices and canteens, a range of Fairtrade products 
            readily available in the area&#146;s shops and served in at least 
            two local cafes, Fairtrade products in use by at least 10 local businesses 
            and organisations including churches, media coverage and popular support 
            and a local Fairtrade steering group to ensure continued commitment 
            to the Fairtrade town status ideal; recognises that this status will 
            establish Paisley as the largest Fairtrade town in Scotland and acknowledges 
            with appreciation the work Renfrewshire Council, the ecumenical effort 
            of the churches in the area, the support of local newspapers and local 
            radio stations, the willingness of many Paisley people to make fair 
            trade a priority and the campaigning of local politicians to this 
            end; believes that Fairtrade products have a key role in raising awareness 
            of significant global issues among consumers and their families, and 
            encourages other towns to follow where Paisley leads.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4066</strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney: Dr Winnie Ewing 
            MSP</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with great respect and 
            affection the work of Dr Winnie Ewing in the Parliaments of Scotland, 
            Westminster and Europe; recognises her unstinting work on behalf of 
            all the peoples of Scotland; recalls the dignity with which she opened 
            the first Scottish Parliament in 1999, and wishes her every happiness 
            in her retirement from public life, but anticipates that she will 
            not relent from her tireless path to advance Scotland's cause in the 
            international community of nations.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-4065</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Parliament

            and pride in, the staff of the Parliament who have been an example 
            of shining endeavour to all in making the Parliament work; is mindful 
            that they, more than politicians, created the Parliament from scratch 
            and adopted an upbeat and helpful attitude that is not present to 
            such a degree in all Parliaments; notes that the staff undertook two 
            big "flits", to Glasgow and to Aberdeen, the burden of which was borne 
            with grace; believes that every single office, clerking, Official

            staff and police and all others, including the restaurant staff and 
            the cleaners who kept things sparkling, deserves recognition and further 
            believes that the staff set an example of public service that elected

            their officials in respect of the requirements of disabled citizens 
            when they visit polling stations to cast their votes but believes 
            that much more needs to be done by the Scottish Executive and Her 
            Majesty&#146;s Government, in consultation with the Royal National 
            Institute of the Blind, in order to ensure that visually-impaired

          <p> <strong>S1M-4060</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Edinburgh Royal 
            Infirmary Parking Charges</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            with concern that, as from mid-April, staff at the new Edinburgh Royal 
            Infirmary will be either paying £250 per annum for a parking permit 
            if they have been successful in their application or paying £10 per 
            day Monday to Friday and £3 per day at weekends; believes that there 
            has been an over-issue of permits; notes that using public transport 
            may be staff&#146;s only option and that, for a theatre staff nurse 
            living in Penicuik and working an 11-hour shift from 7.30am to 6.30pm, 
            this will mean leaving home at 6.20am, changing bus with a three-minute 
            transfer time, in order to arrive at work in time to begin the shift, 
            assuming that all buses run to time; refers to the answer to written 
            question S1W-27065 on 16 July 2002 that stated that a review of car 
            parking charges was to be undertaken; calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to publish results of that review as a matter of urgency, and expresses 
            concern that hospital staff on shifts, with modest income and working 
            in essential medical services, are being charged in this manner. </p>

          <p><strong>S1M-4059</strong> <strong>George Lyon: Over Thirty Months 
            Scheme</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes Scottish farmers&#146; 
            and crofters' deep concerns and anger over the Department for Environment, 
            Food and Rural Affairs' proposal to cut the compensation to them for 
            animals slaughtered under the Over Thirty Months Scheme; further notes 
            that this cut is for apparent financial reasons prior to the completion 
            of the Food Standards Agency's review of the scheme, and calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to press for a delay in the cuts until the 
            Food Standards Agency's consultation on changes to the scheme is completed 
            and a proper strategy put in place for the gradual withdrawal of the 
            scheme causing minimum disruption to the market place. </p>

            campaigning for the poor and disadvantaged and affirms that this lone 
            MSP has left a legacy of life improvement for many which must be continued, 
            including her long battle for 500,000 people in Scotland with chronic 
            pain, her pioneering win in Europe of a landmark pollution case to 
            protect Glasgow, her example in turning out to help constituents during 
            every crisis, from East End flooding to protecting Govanhill pool 
            protesters against a police horse charge, her exposure of injustice 
            to the villagers of Blairingone in a scholarly parliamentary report 
            and her tenacity in always putting the public first, together with

            to order Her Majesty&#146;s armed forces to join the United States 
            of America in the use of military force against Iraq; recognises that 
            this military action will result in the deaths and injury of both 
            innocent Iraqi civilians and United Kingdom servicemen and servicewomen; 
            recognises that such military action is contrary to international 
            law and has undermined the authority of the United Nations; believes 
            that such unilateral action is weakening the international coalition 
            against terrorism and will result in increased support for terrorist 
            groups whose intention is to act against civilians in the United Kingdom 
            and in other countries, and calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to disengage Her Majesty&#146;s forces from hostilities against Iraq, 
            to ensure in the meantime everything is done to minimise the number 
            of civilian casualties resulting from this military action, particularly 
            those caused by the use of cluster bombs, depleted-uranium armaments 
            and landmines and to ensure that humanitarian relief is provided immediately

            the <em>Big Issues in Scotland </em>for 13 to 19 March 2003, in relation 
            to the threatened closure of the 29-bed Rankin Maternity Unit at Greenock's 
            Inverclyde Royal Hospital, that the closure plan was a "farce" and 
            that "the maternity unit should remain in Inverclyde &#133; It has 
            the best safety record in Scotland. Paisley is a run-down hospital 
            and for patients to be travelling 20-40 miles to reach it is a disaster"; 
            further notes that GPs from both Inverclyde and Paisley unanimously 
            voted in favour of the unit remaining in Greenock, and therefore resolves 
            to support the local community and medical campaign to save the Rankin 
            Maternity Unit from closure.</p>

            offering the very best in sports medicine treatment and facilities 
            to the public seven days a week; believes that the clinic serves as 
            a national resource and focus for research and educational activity 
            within sport and exercise medicine fitness and provides specialised 
            equipment and access for athletes with disabilities and that the vast

            by the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning on 
            12 March 2003, regrets that the minister has chosen the cheapest option 
            for the rail link and that there is no commitment to the Glasgow CrossRail 
            scheme, which would connect Glasgow Airport to the entire country 
            and has long been identified as a key component to the success of 
            the Glasgow Airport rail link and crucial to the transport infrastructure, 
            economic development and regeneration of Glasgow and the west of Scotland; 
            notes that travellers from the north and east heading to Glasgow Airport 
            will still have to make their way from Glasgow Queen Street to Glasgow 
            Central Station to connect; believes that the lack of commitment to 
            CrossRail demonstrates a lack of understanding of the needs of passengers, 
            and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should make, at 
            the earliest possible time, a commitment to the development of the 
            Glasgow CrossRail scheme.&quot; </p>

            South Lanarkshire Council&#146;s public private partnership proposal 
            for secondary schools which, if implemented, will lead to 75% of resultant 
            school closures being in East Kilbride, where 50% of secondary schools 
            will be lost resulting in school rolls amongst the highest in Scotland 
            and to considerably longer school journey times for pupils owing to 
            the locations of the proposed schools; notes that the council&#146;s

            further recognises that this is the anniversary of an event that took 
            place in Scotland; notes that, on 28 March 1803, the voyage of William 
            Symington&#146;s steam tug <em>Charlotte Dundas</em>, towing the sloops 
            <em>Active</em> and <em>Euphemia</em> on the Forth and Clyde Canal 
            from Castlecary to Port Dundas in Glasgow, was an event of immense 
            significance for the world; is aware that the anniversary of the birth 
            of steam transport in the United States of America, which took place 
            more than four years later, is already being prepared for and will 
            be celebrated in major style; considers that the completion of the 
            three-quarters model of the <em>Charlotte Dundas</em>, parts of which 
            are in Falkirk museum, would be a useful and positive start to commemorating

            before the United Nations authorise the use of military action against 
            Iraq; recognises that the weight of public opinion is that war on 
            Iraq is not justified at least until a second resolution, clearly 
            authorising the use of military action against Iraq, is agreed by 
            the whole United Nations; recognises that neither Resolution 1441 
            nor the draft second resolution is the justification that many people 
            in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom are demanding before 
            military action is taken; recognises that military action taken on 
            the basis of either resolution could be illegal, leaving the UK and 
            the United States of America governments open to action before the

            1441 or the draft second resolution; remains unconvinced that there 
            is sufficient evidence of the threat from the Iraqi regime to justify 
            a war on Iraq that is certain to result in many thousands of civilian 
            deaths and casualties, and believes that peaceful means to resolve

            outlook in children as well as in adults; congratulates those modern 
            Scottish, English, Welsh and Irish writers who were mentioned in the 
            various shortlists compiled for World Book Day and, in particular, 
            Matthew Fitt, whose ground-breaking novel in Scots featured on the 
            BBC Radio 4 shortlist and Des Dillon, whose novel <em>Me and Ma Gal</em> 
            was voted the book that said most about Scotland in the actual World 
            Book Day poll, and encourages all those involved in politics, education 
            and culture in Scotland to maintain and develop a generous and wide-ranging 
            view of literature and resist any narrow, ill-informed and ideological

            25 million people are infected with the virus, and encourages Scottish 
            organisations and institutions working on HIV/AIDS to develop partnerships

            draft Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill 
            with the express purpose of modernising the framework that provides 
            pupils that need additional support for learning with that support 
            and that the bill has been put out to consultation with parents, professionals 
            and other stakeholders for a ten-week period ending on 28 March 2003; 
            further notes that the draft bill proposes that the Record of Needs 
            be discontinued and replaced by a new Co-ordinated Support Plan &quot;for 
            children with complex or multiple barriers to learning who require 
            additional support from outwith the education authority&quot;; believes 
            that this bill represents significant and fundamental changes to the 
            existing service built up over the last 20 years and that for it to 
            be successful it must enjoy the support of those parents whose children 
            already have a Record of Needs; notes that the Executive&#146;s main 
            method of communicating the bill&#146;s proposals to such parents 
            is to send a copy of the document to all schools, asking them to pass 
            it on to these parents and, in addition, is holding a number of seminars 
            that parents can attend; further notes that many parents are expressing 
            ignorance of the draft bill, its contents and the consultation process 
            and that attendance by parents at these seminars is worryingly low 
            and often in single figures, compared to the large number of well-informed 
            professionals, and therefore supports the extension of the consultation 
            period until after the summer recess of the next parliamentary session 
            so that all parents have ample opportunity to consider the merits 
            and demerits of these radical changes and communicate their views 
            to the new Executive which, in turn, will be able to assess its consultation 
            in a more considered manner and with an accurate response from parents.</p>

            notes that other local authorities are backing Councillor Stewart's 
            original motion because cleaning up chewing gum costs millions of 
            pounds each year, and furthermore believes that the Chancellor of

            of military action against Iraq, that half the Iraqi population is 
            comprised of children under the age of 14, that 70% of the population 
            lives in towns and cities, that 60% are poor and dependent on food 
            rations, that 11.4% of Iraqi children in North Iraq and 23.1% in Central 
            and South Iraq are still chronically malnourished, that under-five 
            child mortality in Central and South Iraq has deteriorated by 160% 
            due to sanctions, that a cut in the food ration provided under the 
            Oil-for-Food programme would trigger even greater poverty, that Iraqi 
            children are forced to drink water that often contains up to ten times 
            the acceptable level of contamination and that the number of internally-displaced 
            persons is already estimated to be between 700,000 and one million; 
            further notes that, against this background, Save the Children is 
            "deeply concerned" at the possibility of renewed conflict as military 
            action would have serious humanitarian consequences for Iraq's vulnerable 
            children, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make all 
            possible representations to prevent this war by addressing the likely 
            impact on the vulnerable and innocent children of Iraq.</p>

            bribe and coerce the UN to secure its will or to proceed unilaterally 
            if it is unable to do so, and believes that the 191 countries of the

            these sections of the community often have difficulties with mobility

            at the plans of the Department for Work and Pensions for social security 
            provision in Scotland including the closure of the Glasgow city office 
            in 2003, which will mean a reduction in service and increased travel 
            for the people in areas such as Glasgow city centre, Townhead, Possilpark,

            report of Stirling Council&#146;s cross-party scrutiny group and its 
            call for the Scottish Executive to reduce its ring-fencing of funding 
            allocated to local authorities; further notes that the scrutiny group 
            highlighted the policy decision of Stirling Council&#146;s current 
            Labour/SNP administration to reduce the share of roads grant-aided 
            expenditure (GAE) allocated to roads, so that in 2001-02 only 65% 
            of it was allocated to roads maintenance, compared with 126% in Perth 
            and Kinross Council and a Scottish average of 103%; notes that, had 
            Stirling Council&#146;s expenditure on roads maintenance been at 100% 
            of roads GAE over the last six years, a further £9.8 million would 
            have been spent on local roads in the district; understands that the 
            SCOTS roads condition survey report, part-funded by the Scottish Executive, 
            is now complete and believes that it should be published, and recognises 
            that solving the problems affecting Stirling&#146;s roads requires 
            a change of policy, from both the Scottish Executive and Stirling 
            Council." </p>

            which reads "The Council considers that a pre-emptive attack on Iraq 
            is neither necessary nor justified and that it would produce incalculable 
            risks to international peace and stability. The Council further considers 
            that British participation in such an attack would be likely to have 
            seriously damaging effects on Glasgow's social and economic welfare 
            and to endanger the safety of its citizens. The Council accordingly 
            calls upon Her Majesty's Government not to commit British Forces to 
            a pre-emptive attack on Iraq."; notes that the petition allows the 
            citizens of Glasgow to register their support or opposition to a war 
            led by President Bush and the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and supports 
            the council's resolution and opposes a pre-emptive attack on Iraq.<strong><em>

            he had strong links with the country through his family and the influence 
            of his work, most notably on the Glasgow Boys; further notes that 
            one of the world's most important collections of Whistler's work is 
            held at the Hunterian Art Gallery and was presented to the University 
            of Glasgow by Whistler's heir, Rosalind Birnie Philip, in recognition

            to introduce legislation to take new powers of direction over the 
            fire service; is mindful that under the Scotland Act 1998 the Scottish 
            Parliament has legislative competence for all fire service matters 
            in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive to develop a distinctive 
            Scottish Fire Service as outlined in the consultation paper <em>The 
            Scottish Fire Service of the Future</em> and to make it clear to Her 
            Majesty's Government that any legislation for the Scottish Fire Service 
            will be subject to proper consultation and scrutiny by the committees 
            of the Parliament.</p>

            North East</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses concern over 
            the level of crime in Grampian; believes that this is largely linked 
            to substance misuse; recognises that substance misuse and consequent 
            crime affect<strike>s</strike> both urban and rural communities in 
            the region; notes that Aberdeen has the highest level of break-ins 
            of any local authority area in Scotland and the second highest level 
            of overall crime; notes that Grampian has the highest level of crimes 
            of dishonesty in Scotland; believes that the situation is not helped 
            by the historical under-funding of Grampian Police which has one of 
            the lowest levels of funding in Scotland and the lowest level of police 
            officers per head of population; further believes that the situation 
            is exacerbated by the length of time that drug misusers must wait 
            for treatment from local services, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should investigate the level of crime in Grampian and take 
            the necessary steps to tackle the causes.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-3819</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Statement by the

            condemns the dictatorial attempt by the Deputy Prime Minister to impose 
            a new national settlement on the firefighters; believes that this 
            is a prelude to cutting the numbers of firefighters, fire stations 
            and level of firecover and is a threat to the people of Scotland and 
            the UK as a whole, and demands that the Scottish Executive resists 
            these attempts and continues the normal process of negotiations and 
            agreement with trade unions.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3813</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: World Economic Forum,

            of Patricia Hewitt, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, at 
            the meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, Switzerland, 
            on 23 to 27 January 2003; notes that the WEF is a meeting of business 
            leaders and politicians to discuss world social and economic policy; 
            notes that previous meetings of the WEF have seen promises from chief 
            executives of multinational corporations about their aspirations to 
            achieve social and environmental responsibility; believes that voluntary 
            action by corporations on environment and social issues is not delivering 
            sustainability, and therefore urges the Secretary of State for Trade 
            and Industry to propose binding rules on corporations in order that 
            they can be held accountable for their environmental and social impacts.</p>

            Nuclear Power Station was recently fined £15,000 for dumping radioactive 
            materials in the sea; notes that Scotland does not need Torness to 
            produce electricity and that it and the other nuclear power stations 
            are a major economic burden to the taxpayer, and therefore calls for 
            Torness to be closed and the workforce to be redeployed to decommission

          <p><strong>S1M-3810</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Private Finance 
            Initiative</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the recent findings 
            of the Audit Commission report into Private Finance Initiative (PFI) 
            in schools in England which compared 17 of 25 PFI schools with 12 
            traditionally funded schools and, in particular, notes that (a) the 
            quality of school buildings built via more traditional means was, 
            on average, better than early PFI schools, (b) there was criticism 
            by users of design aspects such as classroom lay-out and size, (c) 
            there was no clear-cut difference between traditional and PFI schools 
            on unit costs, (d) there were particular concerns regarding risk allocation, 
            for example vandalism was not a risk transferred to the provider although 
            risk management was often the key factor in tipping the balance in 
            favour of PFI, (e) if there was a major problem with a school building 
            the bottom line was that the local authority, bearing statutory responsibility 
            for education provision, had to step in if the PFI provider failed 
            to respond, (f) the report found no evidence that PFI schemes delivered 
            schools more quickly than more traditional methods and (g) the report 
            recommended a choice of procurement options; therefore challenges 
            the statements by the Minister for Finance and Public Services in 
            his letter to me on 20 January 2003 that &quot;the classic Public 
            Private Partnership (PPP) model has been tried and tested by authorities 
            in the market and has shown that it can attract competitive and efficient 
            bids and deliver good outputs&quot; and that PPP will deliver &quot;real 
            improvements to our school estate quickly and effectively&quot;, and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to halt the PFI/PPP programme in 
            the light of this and other critical reports. </p>

            Partnership has completed more than 600 environmental projects with 
            558 companies that have identified over £4.5 million annual cost savings 
            opportunities, over £10 million in new sales opportunities, helped

            management systems; further notes the huge contribution made to recycling 
            in Edinburgh by the Lothian and Edinburgh Environmental Partnership, 
            an organisation that also recycles the Parliament's paper, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency, enter

            that the Holocaust shook the foundations of modern civilisation and 
            that its unprecedented character and horror will always hold universal 
            meaning; condemns the evils of prejudice, discrimination and racism 
            and affirms the values of a free, tolerant, and democratic society; 
            believes that the Holocaust must have a permanent place in our nation's 
            collective memory; honours the survivors still with us and reaffirms 
            our commitment to the shared values of mutual understanding and justice; 
            encourages educators, policy-makers, elected representatives, church 
            and community leaders and parents to work together so that future 
            generations understand the causes of the Holocaust and reflect upon 
            its consequences and vows to remember the victims of Nazi persecution 
            and of all genocide; values the sacrifices of those who risked their 
            lives to protect or rescue victims, as a touchstone of the human capacity 
            for good in the face of evil; recognises that humanity is still scarred 
            by beliefs that nationality, race, religion, disability or sexuality 
            make some people's lives worth less than others and notes that genocide, 
            anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia and discrimination still continue 
            to scar humanity's conscience; pledges to work together against these 
            evils and to strengthen our efforts to promote education and research 
            about the Holocaust and other genocide to make sure that the lessons 
            of such events are fully learnt, and further encourages continuing

            of the privatisation of prison medical services in November 2000 and 
            the award of the contract to Medacs, a company that primarily supplies 
            locum doctors; notes that these consequences include (a) the last 
            information on the cost of primary care being pre-privatisation, when 
            it was in the order of £1.3 million, but no subsequent figures being 
            available owing to commercial confidentiality, (b) the Scottish Prison 
            Service (SPS) not knowing how many doctors Medacs provides because 
            it is for the contractor to arrange to provide the outputs specified 
            in the contract, (c) there being no &quot;output&quot; specification 
            because the contract is to deliver services in accordance with the 
            SPS&#146;s <em>Standards of Healthcare for Prisoners </em>and (d) 
            there having been no attempt to audit the company&#146;s compliance 
            with the <em>Standards of Healthcare for Prisoners</em>; further notes 
            that the poor performance of Medacs is demonstrated by a trebling 
            of prisoner complaint numbers about medical services, substantial 
            fines about which there has been no detailed information owing to 
            commercial confidentiality, the comments of the British Medical Association 
            on the lack of co-ordination between Medacs and the NHS on discharge 
            for ongoing and future care and changing from 30 minutes to 60 minutes 
            the time within which a doctor on call must be able to reach the prison; 
            is further concerned at gaps in SPS knowledge on the state of health 
            of prisoners in that the SPS does not know how many inmates suffer 
            from hepatitis C, HIV and other blood-borne illnesses, tuberculosis 
            or mental illnesses requiring treatment and, in the light of the above 
            and need for openness and accountability, calls upon the Scottish

            of litter in towns, the countryside and on the seashore, illustrated 
            in the correspondence from pupils at Chirnside Primary School, Duns, 
            which highlighted the increased risk of accidents to children, pets 
            and livestock as a consequence of, for example, broken glass and discarded 
            polythene bags; notes that traffic accidents can arise if drivers 
            take avoidance measures when confronted with debris on our roadways 
            and motorways and that the effect on tourism and its consequences 
            to the local and national economy can only be deleterious; further 
            notes that the pupils drew attention to the lack of litter bins, the 
            impact of fast food outlets, the cut in refuse collections and the 
            culture of disregard for the environment and that it may even be regarded 
            by some as "cool" to throw away litter, and therefore believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should consider the following measures: (a) 
            providing education from an early age with accompanying publicity 
            to bring about a culture change of regard for our environment and 
            bring us into line with our European neighbours, (b) endorsing stiffer 
            fines and penalties for litter louts, including community service 
            in clearing litter, (c) being more committed to recycling and providing 
            more assistance to local authorities who have a track record in recycling 
            provision, (d) considering measures, including legislation, to make

            at the prison and saying that Dundee &quot;would love (a prison) because 
            a lot of prisoners come from Dundee&quot;; believes that such comments

            makes 38 recommendations for action in dealing with young people who 
            offend; in particular, notes the report's statements that (a) the

            and a half months for a child to reach a children's hearing and around 
            eight months to get a court decision on a young person, (b) young 
            people are dealt with unevenly across Scotland, (c) large numbers 
            of young people, 2,300 or 16% of those convicted, are imprisoned and 
            that 60% of those re-offend within two years of release, (d) more 
            money, around 60% of the total spending on youth justice, is spent 
            on prosecuting and reaching decisions about young offenders than on 
            services to tackle offending behaviour, (e) there is a chronic shortage 
            of social workers in children's services and 13% of posts for children's 
            services social workers were vacant and (f) information about offending

            reality and in finding ways to develop innovations and discoveries 
            here, rather than simply seeking opportunities overseas; encourages

            to help Scottish businesses and the business base of our universities 
            grow, and believes that the Scottish Executive should give early consideration

            hour minimum wage and a 35-hour maximum working week across the public 
            sector in Scotland would be £450 million per annum and would create 
            an additional 24,000 public sector jobs; further notes that the Scottish 
            Enterprise (SE) budgets for 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 are £446 
            million, £453 million and £454 million respectively; believes that

            conditions and create 24,000 new jobs on a minimum hourly rate of 
            £7.32, as recommended by the Low Pay Unit, and further believes that 
            such a public investment package would end low pay in the public sector,

            of the major benefactors of Scottish music in the twentieth century,

            notes with regret that the Scottish Executive has no plans to follow

            Her Majesty&#146;s Advocate and (2) The Advocate General for Scotland</em>, 
            delivered on 28 November 2002; notes that the appeal arose from an 
            indictment served for trial at the sitting of the High Court at Edinburgh 
            on 2 October 2001 and included charges of indecent behaviour against 
            four young girls including acts on dates when two of the girls were 
            about three years old; notes that, notwithstanding delay in bringing 
            those charges to trial, no submission was made that "R" would not 
            get a fair trial nor was it held that a fair trial was other than 
            still possible; notes the construction placed by the majority of the 
            judges on the application of section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998; 
            believes that the human rights obligation to bring accused persons 
            to trial within a reasonable time might be vindicated by remedies 
            other than dismissal of serious charges without inquiry by a jury; 
            asserts that the right to be brought to trial is comprised in a right 
            to be brought to trial without undue delay and not a right to escape 
            trial because of undue delay and that the moral authority of human 
            rights in the eyes of the public must not be undermined by allowing 
            them to distort existing and sensible protections of our criminal 
            justice system, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to recognise 
            the competing interests of the public and accused persons where a 
            finding is made that there has been unreasonable delay in criminal 
            proceedings and to take all necessary measures to minimise or avoid

            piece of legislation that institutionalises religious discrimination 
            and prejudice; deeply regrets that, despite an on-going campaign in

            last three years, the Prime Minister has yet again refused to introduce 
            legislation at Westminster to repeal the act; condemns the Prime Minister 
            and his government for such intransigence and for their failure to 
            take this action, which would give an example and encouragement to 
            those that highlight the need to reject all manifestations of sectarianism 
            and bigotry, and renews its call for the Act of Settlement 1701 to

            of autistic spectrum disorders, the Scottish Executive should reconsider 
            its position of denying the single vaccines to children on the NHS,

            notes the report&#146;s findings that deaf people are currently excluded 
            from many aspects of everyday life in Scotland because of a lack of 
            linguistic access and that the chief barriers to inclusion are (a) 
            a lack of personnel with appropriate linguistic skills including a 
            lack of British Sign Language/English Interpreters, tutors of British 
            Sign Language and lipspeakers, (b) a lack of resources and materials, 
            and (c) the lack of awareness and understanding of the relevant linguistic 
            issues among employers, service providers and local and national government 
            personnel; further notes the recommendation of the report that, to 
            bring about change, a long-term integrated strategy is needed with 
            collaboration between the statutory and voluntary sector, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should work with key deaf organisations

            job to make sure I'm alright -</em> <em>Report of the Child Protection 
            Audit and Review</em> to tackle the problems in child protection; 
            further welcomes the recommendations of the review, which offers substantial 
            evidence that there is good and effective work being carried out by 
            a number of agencies; regrets that, rather than acknowledge the positives 
            and invest in initiatives to promote consistent good practice across 
            the country, the First Minister has chosen to deride and threaten 
            workers in front-line child protection, while having done little in 
            his administration to resource or support such workers; considers 
            that these remarks will only undermine and damage the Scottish Executive's 
            Care in Scotland campaign to attract people into the social care sector 
            and serve to further demoralise those trying to protect children in 
            increasingly difficult circumstances; notes that the report maintains 
            that, although social workers play the most instrumental role in child 
            protection, the level of vacancies in childcare teams remains a critical 
            issue, a situation that is not being addressed with the urgency it 
            merits and will not begin to be alleviated until at least 2008, when 
            the first graduates will have completed the new training course, and 
            believes that the Executive should take responsibility for this unacceptable 
            situation, introduce measures to tackle recruitment and retention 
            of front-line staff as a matter of priority and, as a further practical 
            step, move as soon as possible towards placing child protection committees 
            on a statutory footing, with adequate resources and an increased status 
            and thereby contribute meaningfully and positively to child protection.</p>

            &#133; who would follow Mussolini&quot; is a disgrace and can only 
            influence the current industrial dispute; calls on the Minister to 
            apologise unreservedly to the firefighters and the trade union movement, 
            and also believes he can no longer be in charge of the fire service

            days; acknowledges the widespread disappointment and frustration at 
            the breakdown of talks between the Fire Brigades Union and local authority 
            employers on the morning of 22 November 2002, talks which had come 
            so close to arriving at a settlement acceptable to both sides; recognises 
            that everyone involved remains very anxious, given the risk to the 
            general public&#146;s health and safety, to seek an agreement that 
            is acceptable to all sides speedily brokered, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government to urge it to do all in its power to help provide the conditions 
            that would enable a settlement to be concluded and one which would

            be schooled outwith the mainstream local authority education system

            acknowledges that the present arrangement, as evidenced by a recent

            has been largely ignored in Scotland for the last 100 years and the 
            many achievements of his expedition have been forgotten, and considers

            further notes that the average cost of caring for someone who becomes

            treatment in England and Wales proposed by the National Institute

          <p><strong>S1M-3242</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Scottish Place 
            Names Survey</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">commends 
            the excellent work undertaken by the Scottish Place Names Survey and 
            by Ian Fraser who retired in Autumn 2001; notes that the discipline 
            of place name studies is of great benefit to a nation, particularly 
            one that has three indigenous languages and whose place names are 
            influenced by no less than six languages, more than in any other European 
            country; accepts that state funding for the discipline is the norm 
            in most European countries and that place name studies contribute 
            valuable assistance to national and local government and to individuals 
            in matters such as sourcing derivations of place names, suggesting 
            appropriate names for new developments, and preserving our cultural 
            and linguistic heritage; agrees with the Principal of the University 
            of Edinburgh that state funding could be expected for the survey while 
            regretting that continued funding by the University is no longer possible, 
            and calls upon the Scottish Executive to provide appropriate financial 
            assistance to the Scottish Place Names Survey to allow it to proceed 
            with the next phase of the Scottish Place Names Database and offer 
            a service to enquirers.</a></p>
