          <p><strong>*S2M-1466</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> &quot;<strong>Super 
            Crabbers&quot; on the Solway Firth</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the return of &quot;super crabbers&quot; to the Solway 
            Firth; notes that last year industrial fishing in the Solway Firth 
            endangered otherwise sustainable local fisheries; notes that &quot;super 
            crabbers&quot; are prevented from fishing within three miles of the 
            Solway Firth on the English side of the Firth and yet are not banned 
            on the Scottish side; notes that the Scottish Executive, under the 
            Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984, has powers to act to protect 
            inshore fisheries and associated communities; congratulates the Executive 
            on the measures that it has just taken under the Act to protect shellfish 
            stocks in Luce Bay and Wigtown Bay; calls on the Executive as a matter 
            of urgency to extend protection to the entire Scottish side of the 
            Solway Firth fishery by imposing a three-mile exclusion zone similar 
            to that on the English side of the Firth, and further calls on the 
            Executive to ensure protection for all of Scotland's marine environment 
            and the communities dependent on them through an integrated Marine 
            Act and the appointment of a dedicated Marine Minister.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1465#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>FareShare 
            and Food Redistribution Schemes</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the valuable contribution made by the Edinburgh Cyrenians and Dundee 
            Cyrenians in establishing their FareShare projects, which collect 
            and redistribute surplus fresh food from manufacturers and retail 
            outlets to centres and shelters for homeless people; notes the direct 
            benefits of providing nutritious food to homeless people while minimising 
            food waste and its subsequent disposal to landfill sites; recognises 
            the additional benefits created by these charities in allowing resources 
            to be diverted into vital counselling, resettlement and other support 
            services and in encouraging homeless people to gain social contact 
            and new skills by participating as volunteers; commends such excellent 
            examples of socially and environmentally responsible partnerships 
            between food manufacturers and the voluntary sector, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should make a firm financial commitment 
            to ensure the continuation of existing projects and the further development 
            and enhancement of such schemes across Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1464</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Family 
            Matters: Improving Family Law in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees that family law reform must safeguard the best interests of 
            children; believes that stability in families should be promoted and 
            supported, and therefore supports the reform of family law so that 
            it reflects the reality of families in Scotland today.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1463</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Water 
            Services etc. (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees 
            to the general principles of the Water Services etc. (Scotland) Bill.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1462#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Gordon 
            Malvenan Wins YOURS Silver Stars Contest</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates all communities in Scotland like Lochgelly, one of Fife's 
            former mining towns, where the community, challenged by issues of 
            serious unemployment and lack of investment has, despite many obstacles, 
            produced a number of citizens who have achieved major recognition 
            and, in particular, congratulates Lochgelly resident, Mr Malvenan, 
            for winning the Scottish area final of Britain's biggest amateur talent 
            contest for senior citizens, and further notes that Mr Malvenan will 
            represent Scotland at the YOURS Silver Stars Grand UK final at Southport's 
            Apollo Theatre on 28 July 2004, illustrating further the great talent 
            and ability that is in Lochgelly, a town that has produced in the 
            very recent past, Debbie Knox, Olympic champion in the women's curling 
            team, and Lochgelly High School students who are the world Highland 
            pipe band champions.</P>
