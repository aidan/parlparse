<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4791</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Forth Estuary Hovercraft</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Stagecoach Group for its innovative bid to slash journey times across the Forth, from Kirkcaldy to Portobello, with plans to trial a hovercraft service for a three-week period and encourages commuters to give the service every consideration in order that it may be fully tested and, if successful, retained as a viable alternative to road and rail travel.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4790</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Organic Aid Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that, out of 314 applications to the Organic Aid Scheme in 2006, only 157 applications were approved, of which only 55 were for ongoing maintenance payments as compared to 102 for conversion from conventional to organic agriculture; compares and contrasts this 50% approval rate with 97% for the preceding year; questions whether this decrease in the approval rate can be reconciled with the aspiration in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s <em>Organic Action Plan</em> &quot;to see Scottish organic products grow in market penetration so that they can meet at least 70% by value of overall Scottish consumer demand for organic products which can be sourced in Scotland&quot;, and calls on the Executive to take immediate action, both to support farmers and to meet market demand for Scottish organic produce.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4789</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Condemnation of US and UK Governments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, on the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, notes the US Senate report which concludes that there was in fact no connection between Al Qaeda, the organisation responsible for the outrage, and Iraq&rsquo;s Saddam Hussein; notes that another of the alleged reasons for the illegal war in Iraq, namely that Saddam was responsible for the 9/11 attacks or was acting in conjunction with Bin Laden, has been exposed as being utterly bogus; believes that the slaughter of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of innocent Iraqis, which followed the deaths of thousands of innocent Americans on 9/11, means that both the US and UK governments stand condemned in the eyes of the peoples of the world, and supports the Time to Go protest outside the Labour Party conference in Manchester on 23 September 2006, organised by the Stop the War Coalition and others demanding the immediate withdrawal of UK troops from Iraq and opposing any US attempts to attack Iran.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4788</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Access to Higher Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the opportunities made available to young people accessing higher education in Scotland and the importance to the Scottish economy of having a highly educated workforce; notes with concern, however, that debt and the fear of debt are having an adverse affect on Scots applying to universities; believes that access to university should be based on the ability to learn, not the ability to pay, and calls for replacement of the current expensive and inefficient student loans system by a fairer grant system and for the problem of student loan graduate debt, which is a drag on the economy, to be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4787</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 20 September 2006</strong></p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4786</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Prison Staff Assaulted in the Course of their Duties</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the number of assaults perpetrated by prisoners against prison staff in the course of their duties in Scotland&rsquo;s prisons; notes that 4% (169) of prison staff were the victims of such assaults in 2005-06; condemns the actions of the perpetrators of such assaults, and expresses its support for the work that prison staff do in what is an extremely demanding working environment.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4785</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Record Prisoner Numbers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuous increase in prisoner numbers in Scotland&rsquo;s prisons from an average of 5,362 in 2000-01 to an actual number of 7,178 as at 1 September 2006, an increase of over 33.86%; recognises that the record increase in prisoner numbers over the last six years has taken place during a period of sustained operational efficiency cuts that have resulted in significant reductions in the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) staff complement at all SPS establishments; acknowledges the additional strain placed on staff and the prison system by such record prisoner numbers; recognises that such overcrowding in Scotland&rsquo;s prisons is having a detrimental effect on the health and safety of staff and prisoners, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review urgently the current operational budget allocation of the SPS.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4784</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Health</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament does not accept the case put forward for the downgrading of the accident and emergency unit at Monklands Hospital and calls on the Scottish Executive to re-examine its decision to approve this downgrading.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4783</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Action on Anti-Semitism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of Westminster&rsquo;s All Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism which was established to investigate the nature and extent of contemporary anti-Semitism throughout the United Kingdom; is disturbed at the rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the UK and the fact that this has been exacerbated by the war in the Middle East, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement the group&rsquo;s recommendations, including applying the same victim-orientated standard to identifying anti-Semitic incidents as to other racist incidents,  better education about anti-Semitism in schools, a crackdown on anti-Jewish activity on university campuses, action to prevent the spread of anti-Semitic material online,  the provision of funding for physical security measures at minority places of worship and the provision of funding for projects that aim to develop good interfaith and intercommunal relations.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4782</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>North East Open Studios 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes North East Open Studios from 16 to 25 September 2006; notes that this is Scotland&rsquo;s largest artist-run open studios event, now in its third year, with 141 studios, workshops, exhibition venues and galleries participating in raising the profile of the visual arts in the north east of Scotland; further notes that this provides a great opportunity for artists, makers and galleries in the north east and for the public to meet them and watch them at work, and congratulates the organisers on what has become a great showcase event for artists in the north east.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4781</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s 10-Year Health Failure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the review of the Scottish Diet Action Plan which has found that, despite numerous high-profile and costly information and advertising campaigns, the Scottish diet is today just as bad as it was 10 years ago; further notes that the bright spot on the horizon is the suggestion that healthier school meals and the introduction of free fruit in schools is beginning to alter children&rsquo;s eating habits but it is not enough as less than half our children take school meals; believes that the introduction of free healthy schools meals for all pupils 10 years ago would have had a big impact on the eating habits of a new generation; considers that the evidence is there internationally that Scotland needs less talk and more action; further considers that the introduction of free healthy school meals for all children would be a first important step to improving the health of our children and the next generation of adults, and believes that MSPs need to support this initiative now as we are running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4780</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Designation of Lead Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Communities Committee be designated as the lead committee in consideration of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill at Stage 1.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4779</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Automated Registration of Title to Land (Electronic Communications) (Scotland) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4778</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Ferry Fares to the Western Isles</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that a study by the Highlands and Islands Transport Partnership in Scotland (HITRANS) estimated that 700 jobs and &pound;22 million a year in tourism revenue could be generated by cutting ferry fares to the Western Isles by 30%; believes that cutting ferry fares is environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial in terms of increased jobs and decreased costs for islanders, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide funding to allow a 30% cut in ferry fares as suggested by HITRANS.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4777</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Kemnay Academy and Keith Grammar&rsquo;s Malawi Efforts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Charley Elrick, Candi Tickle and Emma Waters, pupils at Kemnay Academy, for organising a golf tournament at Kemnay Golf Club to raise funds to allow pupils from Kemnay Academy and Keith Grammar School to travel to Malawi to participate in community projects there and, furthermore, congratulates all 16 pupils from these two schools who intend to take part in this voluntary work programme.</p>
