    Hotel, Callander, is now believed to be the birthplace of modern soccer; further notes
    that this field would therefore be home to the oldest football pitch in the country and
    that competitive matches were played there over 150 years ago; recognises the special
    significance that this pitch will have in the history of Scottish and international
    soccer, and calls upon the Scottish Football Association to consider what action should be

    each whisky; recognises that the whisky industry is extremely important to both
    Scotland&#146;s economy and many rural communities where distilleries are located, and
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to press Her Majesty's Government to ensure that
    countries such as Scotland where there is an abundance of water are exempted from these

    imposition of statistical targets for reducing exclusions; and calls upon the Scottish
    Executive to implement a national strategy for improving school discipline which includes
    an emphasis on the role of parents, improved teacher training, enhanced specialist
    provision in schools, increased numbers of learning and behavioural support teachers, a
    reduction in class sizes, and a constructive use of exclusions.&quot; </p>
