<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>* S3M-6618 Stuart McMillan: Inverclyde Academy Young Engineers Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates pupils at Inverclyde Academy for winning the award of Young Engineers and Science Club of the Year 2010; notes that 380 clubs in Scotland entered the competition and that Inverclyde Academy Young Engineers Club impressed judges by building a voice-activated model house; welcomes the innovation shown by the club, and wishes them all the best for future success.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6617 Elaine Murray: Keep the Moratorium on Whaling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the upcoming Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which takes place in Agadir in Morocco from Monday 21 to Friday 25 June 2010, will discuss lifting the moratorium on commercial whaling; strongly urges the IWC not to relax commercial whaling laws; deplores the practice of commercial whaling, and calls on the Scottish and UK governments to appeal to the whaling nations to stop the practice.</p>
<p><strong>* S3M-6616 Jack McConnell: Retirement of Colin Cameron, Honorary Consul of Malawi in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the retirement of Colin Cameron as Malawi&rsquo;s Honorary Consul in Scotland at the end of June 2010; congratulates him for carrying out his many duties with distinction since his appointment in May 1995; commends him for his significant contribution to the renewed friendship between Scotland and Malawi and for his dedication to Malawi since the campaign for independence from colonial rule in the 1950s; welcomes the appointment of Dr Peter West as his successor, and wishes him well in this important role.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6615 Jackie Baillie: Keep Leuchie House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the decision to close Leuchie House; notes that Leuchie House is the only respite home operating in Scotland and northern England for people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is one of only four across the United Kingdom; believes that the level of care given at Leuchie House is exceptional; notes that the facility that it offers MS patients to holiday with their carer and their children is unique; notes that it has continually achieved the maximum evaluation of excellent in every area of inspection by the Care Commission; recognises that Leuchie House is much valued by service users; believes that the closure of such a specialised facility will cause a strain on families and other services, such as the NHS, as they struggle to cope with the needs of MS patients, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure the continuation of the facility.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-6614 Jamie Hepburn: Ambassadors for Peace Awards for Airdrie and Coatbridge Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Airdrie Academy and St Margaret&rsquo;s High School in Airdrie as well as Coatbridge High and St Ambrose schools in Coatbridge, which are due to receive Ambassadors for Peace certificates later this month; notes the work that the pupils and the schools have undertaken to achieve this award; thanks Sense over Sectarianism, Strathclyde Police, Albion Rovers and Pat Rolink for their involvement and support for the scheme, and acknowledges the Ambassadors for Peace scheme as an excellent scheme for schools to work toward.</p>
