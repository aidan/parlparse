            with the Executive, NHS and the Scottish people to address constructively and
            imaginatively the challenges of building a 21st century NHS.<b><i> </p>
            <p ALIGN="left"></i></b>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments<b><i></p>
            <p ALIGN="left"></i></b><strong>S1M-383.1 Kay Ullrich: Health&#151;</strong>As an
            amendment to motion (S1M-383) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from
            &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets the lower rise in health spending
            in Scotland in comparison with England, in spite of the widening gap in poverty and ill
            health between north and south; opposes the continued reliance on PFI, and calls upon the
            Scottish Executive to accept its responsibility to provide adequate resources in order to
            support a National Health Service in Scotland fit for the 21st Century.&quot; <b><i></p>

            increase in bureaucracy within the NHS and the Executive&#146;s folly of pursuing a raw
            waiting list target that has led to the negation of its promises on health; notes with
            concern the overspend by health boards in the current year, the increasing levels of bed
            blocking and the failure of the Arbuthnot Report to address inequality in health spending;
            believes that the development of a modern NHS depends on a sustained programme of service
            redesign, greater public accountability and involvement and true partnership working
            across the NHS in Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make the reduction of
            waiting times and access to treatment on the basis of clinical need its top priority for
            all the NHS in Scotland.&quot; <b><i></p>
