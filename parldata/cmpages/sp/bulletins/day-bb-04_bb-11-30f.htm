          <!-- #BeginEditable "Body text" -->
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2086</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> <strong>The Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Communities Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/489) as the committee is not reassured that local authorities are in a position to comply with the order without causing unfair consequences for other applicants with priority needs for housing.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2085#</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>St Andrews World Heritage Site Status</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports a campaign to encourage the UK Government to obtain World Heritage Site status from UNESCO for St Andrews; recognises that St Andrews is the home of golf, the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing sport and that it is also the historic ecclesiastical capital of Scotland; believes that its cultural and educational contributions, in particular Scotland&rsquo;s oldest university, should be formally acknowledged; notes that St Andrews is regarded worldwide as unique, not only for its medieval town centre, but also for its captivating and award-winning natural features, and considers that the Scottish Executive should support St Andrews as an eminently-suitable Scottish candidate for the UK Tentative List.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Mr Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Mitchell<strong>*</strong>, Alex Johnstone<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2084</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Helpline for Older People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of Age Concern Scotland and, in particular, the success of the Scottish Helpline for Older People launched in June 2004; notes that, since that date, it has dealt with 3,000 calls Scotland-wide, with 150 per week on average, that its service is available in over 120 languages through the use of Language Line and that it also provides a textphone service for the hard of hearing; further notes that, during this period, it has provided over 100 referrals to specialist organisations, and commends its aims for the coming years to market the helpline specifically to black and minority ethnic communities and to continue to develop an effective referrals structure.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2083</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Gaelic and Scots Translations of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Article IV-448, paragraph 2, of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe allows EU member states to translate the treaty into any of the languages of that Member State and that a certified copy of any such translation may thereafter be deposited in the archives of the European Council; further notes the commitments made to Scotland&rsquo;s languages in the manifestos of the various political parties and in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s cultural strategy, as well as in the working practices of the Parliament; considers that the translation of the treaty into the Gaelic and Scots languages would be a symbolically important means of demonstrating a continued commitment to the long-term future of these important elements of Scottish culture; considers that any such translations should be made available prior to the proposed referendum on the treaty in order to allow voters to refer to the treaty in their chosen language, and accordingly calls on the Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government with a view to having the translations completed.</p>
