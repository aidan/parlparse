          <p><strong>*S1M-3192</strong> <strong>Mike Watson: Value of Participation 
            in Sport in Increasing the Quality of Life</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament recognises the value of sport to the quality of life in 
            Scotland and the importance of the role it plays in developing the 
            health and well-being of the nation; welcomes the commitment of the 
            Executive and <strong>sport</strong>scotland to work with governing 
            bodies, local authorities and all other partners to widen participation 
            in sport at all levels, and encourages all those with an interest 
            in sport to contribute to the current review of sport 21, the strategy 
            for sport in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dr Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3191#</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Dundee Heritage 
            Trust</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that our industrial 
            heritage is of interest to many people from other countries as well 
            as Scots; notes with concern, however, that despite strenuous efforts 
            and exploration of all possible funding opportunities, Dundee Heritage 
            Trust, the charity which owns Dundee's leading tourist attractions, 
            RRS Discovery and the Verdant Works, has been forced by a continuing 
            and critical shortfall in revenue support into a series of cost-cutting 
            exercises and staff redundancies, the latest being the loss of their 
            very experienced and committed chief executive; recognises that the 
            seriousness of this move cannot be underestimated and is a worrying 
            indication that the closure of both Discovery Point and the Verdant 
            Works may now be imminent; considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            put in place a financial package with immediate effect and extend 
            central revenue support as part of a longer term strategy to secure 
            the future of these significant visitor attractions, both of which 
            achieved five star grading by VisitScotland, with Dundee Heritage 
            Trust being the only independent operator in Scotland to achieve this 
            accolade, and notes that the loss of RRS Discovery, which gives the 
            city of Dundee its "identity" and the Verdant Works, the last working 
            jute mill in Scotland and European Industrial Museum of the Year in 
            1999, to the cultural heritage of the nation would be both significant 
            and irreplaceable.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3190</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Congratulations 
            to Lennox Lewis</strong>&#151;That the Parliament warmly congratulates 
            Mr Lennox Lewis on his great victory as World Boxing Council and International 
            Boxing Federation heavyweight boxing champion; regards him as an excellent 
            role model for young people of all backgrounds and a fine ambassador 
            for our country, and extends a cordial invitation to him to visit 
            the Parliament on his next trip to Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David McLetchie<strong>*</strong>, Mr Brian Monteith<strong>*</strong>, 
            Alex Fergusson<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3189</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Rural Developments 
            in the Edinburgh Green Belt</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            the decision of Midlothian Council to commence the construction of 
            a large roundabout near Roslin, Midlothian, despite the fact that 
            objections to the proposal at the Midlothian Local Plan Inquiry have 
            not yet been resolved; believes that the proposals as they stand are 
            inappropriate in scale and damaging to a fragile area of Edinburgh&#146;s 
            Green Belt, and therefore calls on Midlothian Council to review the 
            decision through a process of consultation on how transport links 
            on the A701 can be best improved and the quality of the Green Belt 
            protected.</a></p>
