    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-223#</b> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Pardon for Executed Soldiers</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament believes that it is not too late to restore the names and reputations of
    the soldiers of the British Empire Forces court martialled and executed, mostly on the
    Western Front, in the four years 1914-18, following charges ranging across desertion,
    cowardice, quitting posts, sleeping at posts, disobedience, striking a superior officer
    and casting away arms; regrets deficiencies in their opportunity to prepare adequate
    defence and appeals; notes the marked and enlightened change in the Army's attitude just
    over a score of years later to the consequences of soldiers enduring long periods of
    severe cold and damp, lack of food and sleep coupled with the stress and shock of constant
    shellfire with the result that not a single solider was executed on these charges
    throughout the six years from 1939-45; considers that the vast majority of the 307
    executed were as patriotic and brave as their million other compatriots who perished in
    the conflict and that their misfortune was brought about due to stress, or the stress of
    their accusers, during battle, and that even if the behaviour of a small minority may have
    fallen below that of the highest standards then time, compassion and justice dictates that
    all of these soldiers should now be treated as victims of the conflict, and urges Her
    Majesty&#146;s Government to recommend a posthumous pardon, thus bringing to a close a
    deeply unhappy and controversial chapter in the history of the Great War.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-222</b> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Criminal Legal Aid</strong>&#151;That the
    Justice and Home Affairs Committee recommends that nothing further is to be done under the
    Criminal Legal Aid (Fixed Payments) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1999 (SSI 1999/48).</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-221</b> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Domestic Violence</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament supports the final Workplan prepared by the Scottish Partnership on Domestic
    Abuse and welcomes the establishment by the Scottish Executive of a Domestic Abuse Service
    Development Fund to improve local arrangements for assisting women and children who are
    victims of domestic abuse.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Jackie Baillie<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-220</b> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Illegality of Nuclear Weapons</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament hails the decision of Sheriff Margaret Gimblett on 21 October at Greenock
    Sheriff Court to order the acquittal of Ellen Moxley, Ulla Roder and Angie Zelter on
    charges of causing damage to a Trident vessel in Loch Goil; salutes the courage of all
    four women; recognises that this historic decision in effect rules that the deployment of
    nuclear weapons is illegal under international law, and calls upon Her Majesty&#146;s
    Government to show a lead to other nuclear powers by removing all nuclear weapons from
    British soil and British territorial waters and pursuing a non-nuclear defence strategy.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-219#</b> <strong>Phil Gallie: Proof of Age Card Scheme</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament commends the actions of South Ayrshire Council in setting up the Proof of Age
    Card Scheme, which addresses in a positive manner the problem of underage procurement of
    alcohol, cigarettes and other harmful substances.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Michael Russell<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-218#</b> <strong>Phil Gallie: Scottish Prison Service</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament condemns the reduction of funding for the Scottish Prison Service; expresses
    concern at statements made that this will lead to a reduction in prison officers, and
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to reverse its inappropriate and potentially dangerous
    decision.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-217</b> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Nuclear Weapons</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament, conscious of the assurances from the Ministry of Defence about the safety of
    the military nuclear facilities at Faslane and Loch Goil, notes that the three women
    accused of illegally entering the military base there gained easy entry; notes the
    universal acceptance of the inherent danger to human life posed by nuclear material; calls
    upon the Scottish Executive to initiate an immediate investigation into the threat to the
    health and safety of the Scottish population and the environment represented by the
    nuclear base, and requests Her Majesty&#146;s Government to suspend all military
    activities there.</p>
