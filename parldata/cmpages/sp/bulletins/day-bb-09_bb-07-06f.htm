<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4564</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Forres Academy&rsquo;s 40 Years of Teaching</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Forres Academy on reaching 40 years of teaching excellence; acknowledges the thousands of pupils from the wider community and outlying villages who have passed through its doors over the last 40 years; notes that the commemorative whisky being produced by the Glen Moray distillery is a fitting tribute in the Year of Homecoming 2009 and is pleased that a percentage of the revenue will go to the school&rsquo;s Enrichment Fund, and finally notes that events will be taking place throughout the year and wishes Forres Academy every success in its next 40 years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4563</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Boroughmuir High School Wins National Consumer Champions Award Again</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Boroughmuir High School&rsquo;s team of Scott Duncan, Malcolm Perry, Cameron Roscoe and Ruaridh Beveridge on winning the Young Consumers of the Year 2009 Award in Brighton on 1 July 2009, sponsored by The Trading Standards Institute, in which the team represented not only their school and city but also Scotland, making them national champions, and on regaining the title yet again for Boroughmuir High.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-4559</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>ID Cards Ruled Out as &quot;Compulsory&quot; for British Citizens</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by Alan Johnson MP, Home Secretary, that ID cards will not be compulsory for British citizens; considers, however, that Mr Johnson&rsquo;s announcement obfuscates the intention of the UK Government to make the passport a &quot;designated document&quot;, meaning that the details of everyone who applies for a passport will be stored on a national identity register and that the identity scheme will remain, in practice, compulsory; believes that the UK Government&rsquo;s change of tack is a mere attempt to implement the identity scheme through the back door, and calls on the UK Government to wholly abandon this wasteful and unpopular scheme.</p>

  in order to demonstrate that no one is above the law, and calls on Prime Minister Gordon Brown to condemn the illegal detention of UK citizens, be it by Iran or Israel, and for the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, to redouble his efforts to secure meaningful change to Israel&rsquo;s current position.</p>
