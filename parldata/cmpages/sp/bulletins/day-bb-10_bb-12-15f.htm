<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7605 Fergus Ewing: Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the first annual report of progress made in implementing the antisocial behaviour framework, <em>Promoting Positive Outcomes: Working Together to Prevent Antisocial Behaviour in Scotland</em>, which shifts the emphasis onto prevention and early, effective intervention while recognising that enforcement measures are appropriate in some circumstances; welcomes the support for this approach from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA), the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (SOLACE), the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS), the Chief Fire Officers Association in Scotland (CFOAS), the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration (SCRA), the Association of Directors of Social Work (ADSW), the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), Youthlink, the Judicial Studies Committee, Victim Support Scotland, Safeguarding Communities Reducing Offending (SACRO), the Scottish Youth Parliament, academia and the third sector; further welcomes the &pound;20 million being invested in Scotland&rsquo;s communities through the Cashback for Communities initiative, which provides free activities for young people, and further notes the progress made across a range of areas in improving community safety.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7604 Andy Kerr: Winter Resilience</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that lessons have to be learned about how the Scottish Government and its agencies react to exceptional weather conditions; considers that MSPs must now look ahead and work together to ensure that all possible measures are taken to prevent the experience of recent weeks, which saw older people trapped in their homes, schools shut, people stranded on roads, businesses losing money, diesel and food supplies running low, mail undelivered and bins not collected; calls on the Scottish Government to improve communications, ensure closer and effective liaison with all appropriate organisations and consider more robust planning exercises, and, while acknowledging that severe weather will cause disruption and delays, believes that Scotland needs to keep moving regardless of the weather conditions.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7603 Alex Salmond: Appointment of Junior Scottish Minister</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Angela Constance be appointed as a junior Scottish Minister.</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7602 Bill Wilson: UN Resolution 65/55 on Depleted Uranium</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes, with reference to motion S3M-7332 by Bill Wilson, <em>UN Vote on Depleted Uranium</em>, its disappointment at the United Kingdom&rsquo;s rejection of a United Nations&rsquo; resolution inviting state users of depleted uranium weapons to reveal where the weapons have been fired when countries affected by them ask for such information; regrets that the UK Government did not respond to motions on this topic in the UK and Scottish Parliaments, and congratulates the 148 states that voted for the UN resolution.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7601 Kenny MacAskill: The Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 (Designation of Participating Countries) (Scotland) Order 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 (Designation of Participating Countries) (Scotland) Order 2011 be approved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7600 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Forth Crossing Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Forth Crossing Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9C.12.5, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, that time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in the Stage being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>
<p>Groups 1 and 2: 25 minutes</p>
<p>Groups 3 and 4: 35 minutes.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7599 Alasdair Allan: Western Isles School Leavers&rsquo; Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that Scottish Government statistics show that school leavers in the Western Isles are more successful at finding a place in further or higher education, a job or training than those in the rest of Scotland, with 94.3% of pupils in the Western Isles leaving school between August 2009 and June 2010 going into these areas; notes that this figure is 7.5% higher than the Scottish average, and believes that this proves the benefits of the particular system of education in the Western Isles and counters the negative perceptions of after-school destinations in the Outer Hebrides.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7597 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following revision to the programme of business for Wednesday 15 December 2010&mdash;</p>
<p>after</p>
<p>2.00 pm Time for Reflection</p>
<p> <em>followed by</em> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p>insert</p>
<p> <em>followed by</em> Scottish Government Debate: Ministerial Appointment</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7596 Lewis Macdonald: Glencraft&rsquo;s Royal Warrant</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the management and staff of Glencraft on the reinstatement of its royal warrant and its contract to supply beds to the Royal Family for three years; acknowledges the hard work of the staff, board and supporters of Glencraft in securing what it considers to be viable future business, and looks forward to what it believes will be increasing demand for high quality Glencraft furniture in Aberdeen and across Scotland in the years to come.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7595 Sandra White: Cut the VAT on Building Repairs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports calls from the Federation of Master Builders Scotland for the UK Government to reduce the rate of value added tax (VAT) to 5% on construction repair and improvement work to existing buildings; believes that reducing VAT on repairs and maintenance would bring a number of benefits to hard-pressed Scottish homeowners; further believes that such a reduction would encourage people to make homes more energy efficient, helping Scotland meet its Energy Efficiency Action Plan targets and, in turn, its climate change targets, and considers that a reduction in VAT would boost the Scottish construction industry and create up to 2,235 new Scottish building jobs during the first 12 months of the reduction.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7594 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Support for Lothian Bus Workers&rsquo; Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the excellent track record of Lothian Buses, winners of the UK Bus Operator of the Year Award 2007 and the Public Transport Operator of the Year Award 2008; believes that the publicly owned company provides a high quality and profitable public transportation service for over 350,000 passengers per day; understands there to be considerable opposition among the Edinburgh and Lothians travelling public, Lothian Bus staff and unions to the continuation of Transport Edinburgh Ltd (TEL) and the proposed merger of Lothian Buses and Transport Initiatives Edinburgh Ltd (TIE); notes that the decision on any merger is one for the City of Edinburgh Council; is concerned about the potential consequences of such a merger for bus passengers; therefore believes that the case for merger has not been made and urges the city council instead to task the operation of any completed tram line to Lothian Buses, debt free and in full public ownership, and supports the Lothian Bus workers&rsquo; campaign to this end.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7593.1 Patrick Harvie: Forth Crossing Bill</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7593) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot; but, in so doing, considers that, in light of the current economic and environmental circumstances, the Scottish Government should not sign any further contracts relating to the works set out in the Forth Crossing Bill until a re-inspection of the cables of the existing Forth Road Bridge and an evaluation of the current dehumidification works have been conducted and until a further assessment has been made thereafter, if necessary, of the most cost-effective way for the existing road bridge to be repaired&quot;.</p>
<p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-7529 Jackson Carlaw: Sentencing of Mohammed Sandia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the comments of Mohammed Sandia who posted a series of what it considers disgraceful anti-Semitic remarks on <em>The Scotsman</em> newspaper&rsquo;s website; welcomes what it considers Sheriff Gordon Liddell&rsquo;s unequivocal condemnation of Sandia&rsquo;s comments when he appeared for sentencing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on 10 November 2010; considers that Mr Sandia&rsquo;s prosecution sends out a welcome message to society at large about how indefensible anti-Semitism is and how vile its consequences can be; congratulates the determination of the police and Crown Office to pursue this case to its conclusion, and urges editors of all media, and online media outlets in particular, to be on their guard to prevent similar instances of religious or racial hatred from finding their way onto their pages in the future.</p>
