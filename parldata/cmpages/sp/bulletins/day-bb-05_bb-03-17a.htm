         <p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
         <p>9.30 am&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
         <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Education&mdash;</p>
         <p><strong>S2M-2597</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that, as a result of the current government&rsquo;s centralising agenda and top-down approach, education in Scotland is characterised by low levels of attainment, alarming levels of indiscipline in too many of our schools, inadequate vocational provision and over-regulation; believes that developing a system of independently-managed but publicly-funded schools will reduce inequality by giving all parents a choice of school for their children; believes that, as well as supporting alternatives to exclusion, headteachers should have the right in statute to exclude violent and disruptive pupils permanently; opposes the repeal of the School Boards Act 1988 and believes that parents should retain their statutory rights regarding the appointment of headteachers and deputy headteachers; supports the retention of charitable status for independent schools and the extension of this status to all schools that wish it; believes that schools for children with special educational needs are vital to ensure that all are catered for and should be maintained where there is a demand, and notes that the direct funding of schools by the Scottish Executive on a per capita basis will create competition, drive up standards and benefit the council tax payer. </p>
         <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
         <p><strong>S2M-2597.3</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2597) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the dedication of teachers and support staff in Scotland&rsquo;s schools to achieving excellent outcomes for the young people of Scotland; supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s agenda for the most comprehensive modernisation programme in Scottish schools for a generation, as described in <em>Ambitious, Excellent Schools; </em>acknowledges the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to building on the investment and successes in education over recent years; welcomes plans to bring a transformation in ambition and achievement through higher expectations for schools and school leadership, and recognises greater freedom for teachers and schools, better parental involvement and choice for pupils, increased and further enhancement of school/college partnerships to extend learning opportunities for pupils and better support for learning so that the individual needs of young people can be better met through tough, intelligent accountabilities to drive improvement.&quot; </p>
         <p> <strong>S2M-2597.1</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2597) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the efforts of teachers to deliver a quality education for pupils in increasingly challenging circumstances, the potential of Scotland&rsquo;s pupils to succeed and the need for national government resources, which directly impact on the classroom experience, to provide sufficient time and attention for pupils from teachers in a peaceful, stimulating environment with a relevant, flexible curriculum for them to achieve that potential, and calls on the Scottish Executive to, in particular, develop policies to cut class sizes, to examine the plethora of initiatives and complexity of competitively bid-for funding streams and to reassess the impact of, and support given to, its social inclusion and mainstreaming agenda to ensure that all children can get the most out of their time in school education.&quot; </p>
         <p> <strong>S2M-2597.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2597) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;fully endorses a comprehensive education system based on equality of opportunity for all from the nursery sector through to secondary education and beyond; supports a reduction in class sizes to no more than 20 or, indeed, less, along with suitably-qualified support teachers with expertise in working alongside classroom teachers to support pupils with special educational needs and social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, and recognises that early intervention in early years, learning styles and developing emotional intelligence are key areas that require different approaches to learning and teaching, alongside flexibility to ensure that all children and young people reach their potential.&quot; </p>
