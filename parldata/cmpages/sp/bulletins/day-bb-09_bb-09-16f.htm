<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4862</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Diageo</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the work of the Diageo Taskforce to safeguard jobs in the west of Scotland; notes with real disappointment that the taskforce and Diageo were unable to agree a way forward; recognises that support for the individuals and communities affected is a major priority; calls on the Scottish Government to support the trades unions in their efforts to ensure that an extension on the proposed closure of Port Dundas is fully considered, that the proposed new jobs in Leven are permanent and high quality in nature and the formal consultation process between Diageo and&nbsp;trades&nbsp;unions is extended to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to mitigate the closure of&nbsp;the Kilmarnock&nbsp;packaging plant, and supports the continued work of taskforce members to tackle the devastating impacts that the job losses will have on the affected communities.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4861</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Road Safety Framework</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication on 15 June 2009 of Scotland&rsquo;s Road Safety Framework to 2020; notes the road safety vision for Scotland, which is in line with other leading road safety countries, and further notes the road safety targets, priorities and commitments and the support of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland to tackle road casualty reductions in Scotland over the next decade.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4860</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Ravenswood Bog and Meadow Nature Reserve</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the launch on 24 September 2009 of Ravenswood Bog and Meadow Nature Reserve in Cumbernauld, a project that is the culmination of a successful partnership between Greenspace Services of North Lanarkshire Council, the Scottish Training Foundation and the local community; notes that the project has transformed a large and inaccessible area of open waste land between the A80 and A73 to an all-weather surfaced path network that includes a timber boardwalk and the creation of new wildlife ponds, gardens and orchid meadow areas, and also notes that the project has provided 40 training opportunities for local people to develop new skills and gain essential work experience.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4859</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Supporting Scotland&rsquo;s Hydrogen Future</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the first hydrogen corridor in the United Kingdom, with the Royal Mail Group, CIFAL Findhorn, members of the Scottish Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association and others joining forces to create one of the most ambitious hydrogen transport programmes in the world; notes that the Scottish Hydrogen Corridor will run from Aberdeen to Inverness via Findhorn, employing a diversity of renewable energy solutions in different locations, with hydrogen refuelling stations placed at strategic locations along the route to service a range of users, including public transport providers, local authority vehicles, Royal Mail vans and, ultimately, private car users all dedicated to reaching CO2 reduction goals through sustainable mobility and other initiatives; notes the recent letter of understanding addressed to oil and energy companies, government organisations and NOW GmbH, signed by top executives from Daimler, Ford, GM/Opel, Honda, Hyundai/KIA, the Renault-Nissan Alliance and Toyota, committing each company to the cooperative development and market introduction of fuel cell vehicles and an eventual competitive network of commercialised fuel cell vehicles from 2015 onwards; further commends Royal Mail, CENEX, PostEurop and Fuel Cell Europe for joining forces to accelerate development of hydrogen fuel cell postal vans and opening the design brief to all other European postal operators for input in order to stimulate mainstream construction at affordable prices; welcomes delegates to Scotland&rsquo;s Hydrogen Future Conference, organised by CIFAL Findhorn, UNITAR and many other partners in cooperation with the Scottish Government, taking place at Victoria Quay, Edinburgh, on 15 and 16 September 2009, and praises their commitment to extending the role that hydrogen can play in creating a sustainable economy for Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4858</strong> <strong>Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Tomorrow&rsquo;s People, 25th Anniversary in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the national employment charity, Tomorrow&rsquo;s People, on its 25th anniversary in Scotland; notes that, since its inception in 1984, the charity has been operating in deprived communities across the central belt of Scotland, helping over 10,000 long-term unemployed people on their journeys back into work; acknowledges that, in this time, Tomorrow&rsquo;s People has been very focused on the plight of socially-excluded and marginalised young people, running successful programmes for 16 to 24-year-olds since 1999; applauds its announcement that, over the next five years, it will expand its Working It Out programme into four new areas across the central belt and Ayrshire; recognises that this programme focuses on disadvantaged young people who have left school with no formal qualifications or who have been involved in drugs, gangs or alcohol-related crime and gives them the opportunity to learn new skills through working on projects in their local communities, and further congratulates Tomorrow&rsquo;s People on giving these young people the confidence and self-belief to help them change their lives forever and get out of the dangerous cycle of unemployment and crime that many find themselves in today.</p>

<p><em><strong>2.55 pm</strong>&#9;Scottish Government Debate: Scottish Road Safety Framework</em></p>
<p>and insert</p>
<p><em><strong>2.55 pm</strong>&#9;Ministerial Statement: Budget</em></p>
<p><em>followed by&#9;&#9;  Scottish Government Debate: Scottish Road Safety Framework</em></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4852&diams; </strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Charter of Rights for People with Dementia in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the principle of a charter of rights for people with dementia, as proposed by the Cross-Party Group on Alzheimer&rsquo;s; believes that changing attitudes and practices that deny people with dementia their rights is a major challenge facing health and social care groups; notes the recent publication of a number of reports that have highlighted the inefficiencies in the quality of care for people with dementia in the community, in care homes and in long-term hospital care, including the Care Commission report,<em> Better care, every step of the way</em>, and the joint report by the Care Commission and Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, <em>Remember, I&rsquo;m Still Me</em>; notes the consultation undertaken over the summer to give people with dementia, their carers, health professionals and care home staff, among other stakeholders, an opportunity to express their views on the issues that they believe a charter should address; welcomes the commitment of Alzheimer Scotland to enable stakeholders to participate by organising roadshows in Irvine, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Inverness; acknowledges that the charter of rights is based on internationally agreed human rights and is intended to promote the respect, protection and fulfilment of all human rights of people with dementia and their carers, and therefore welcomes the idea of a charter as both an instrument for enabling culture change and as a tool to empower people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4851&diams; </strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Kintore Station and Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that passenger numbers at the reopened Laurencekirk station have exceeded estimations by around 80%; notes that the decision by the previous Scottish Executive to reopen the Laurencekirk station followed a long community-based campaign; believes that a reopened Kintore station would be similarly successful; expresses its concern that progress on the Aberdeen Crossrail project has stalled under the current Scottish Government, and would welcome funding being brought forward to reopen Kintore station as part of the Aberdeen Crossrail project.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4850</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Protecting and Encouraging Scottish Food and Drink</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 2009 Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight and its aims to encourage people to discover, buy and enjoy the produce produced on their doorstep, encourage the food industry, from restaurants to retailers and caterers, to source and champion quality Scottish produce, build Scotland&rsquo;s reputation for excellent quality food and drink and raise awareness of and support for the people who produce Scotland&rsquo;s food and drink; praises Scotland Food and Drink&rsquo;s goal of growing the industry from &pound;7.5 billion to &pound;10 billion by 2017 and its vision of building Scotland&rsquo;s international reputation as the land of food and drink; further welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s support for Scotland Food and Drink and their collaboration on Workstream 1 of the <em>National Food and Drink Policy</em>, driving forward sustainable economic growth across the industry and boosting the profile of Scottish produce, and finally welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the identity of iconic Scottish produce through Protected Food Name (PFN) status, with nine Scottish foods already designated PFNs, and extending the list with a number of applications currently being considered, including Stornoway black pudding, traditional Ayrshire Dunlop cheese and Scottish wild salmon, which will further cement Scotland&rsquo;s reputation as the land of food and drink.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4848</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Open University Graduation Ceremony in Shetland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Open University for holding a graduation ceremony in the Town Hall, Lerwick, on 5 September 2009 to mark the special relationship between the Open University and Shetland; notes that, in the 40 years since the Open University was founded, over 3,400 Shetlanders have studied with it, including 156 Shetlanders in 2007-08; further notes that this gives Shetland the highest participation rate in Open University study of anywhere in the United Kingdom; believes that the Open University&rsquo;s success in Shetland is the result of its offering a service suited to Shetlanders&rsquo; needs and that it sets an example that many other Scottish and UK public and private organisations would do well to follow; congratulates all Shetlanders who have completed Open University degree courses over the past 40 years, and offers best wishes to all those who will study with it over the next 40 years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4834.1</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Welcoming Sea Angling Strategy Group</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4834) in the name of Bill Wilson, insert at end &quot;, and recognises the significant contribution that sea anglers can make to inshore fisheries research on the basis of the painstakingly recorded figures that they have accumulated on catches of a wide variety of fish around Scotland&rsquo;s coasts over the years, and calls on the Scottish Government to recognise the Sea Anglers&rsquo; Conservation Network as a statutory consultee in the run up to the proposed Marine (Scotland) Bill and all further regulatory developments in relation to activities in Scotland&rsquo;s waters and to include it as a full member of the Inshore Fisheries Groups.</p>
