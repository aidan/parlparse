                        needs to be done, particularly for those patients experiencing 
                        the longest waits; welcomes the work of the National Waiting

                            in Scotland; calls for deferred waiting lists to be

                            waiting time guarantee; supports the work of the National

                            for NHS patients in Scotland, and supports more vigorous

                            and the delays experienced by patients awaiting discharge

                            times are longer than they were when the Scottish

                            drop in NHS activity; particularly regrets the political 
                            interference within the NHS which has led to the inconsistent 
                            and unclear record keeping within the NHS discovered 
                            by Audit Scotland; and further notes that while the

                            will only get worse and that the best way to deliver 
                            improvements is to put patients first by giving them 
                            real choices and devolving power to local hospitals 
                            and GPs so that decisions are taken on the basis of

                        the newspaper that Scotland must not be a country where 
                        it is a crime to be poor and where loan sharks obtain 
                        huge profits out of other people's precarious financial 
                        circumstances, and is of the firm view that the Parliament, 
                        in close partnership with the UK Parliament, the police
