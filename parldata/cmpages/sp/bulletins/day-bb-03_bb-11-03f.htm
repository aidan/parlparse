            Holyrood Inquiry and, in relation to this debate, agrees that under 
            section 23 of the Scotland Act 1998 the producers and commissioning

            the safety of the MMR vaccine is unresolved and considers that single 
            vaccines, administered at intervals, should be available in Scotland 
            as an alternative choice to MMR.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-537</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Success

            Parliament recognises the success of Central Scotland Police's Operation 
            Overlord; notes that over the last six months officers have seized 
            more than £300,000 worth of drugs from over 800 raids and searches; 
            further notes that some £400,000 has been seized and is being investigated 
            by the Crown Office under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and congratulates 
            the Central Scotland Police force on their efforts in removing drugs,

            condolences to his family and recognises his extensive contribution 
            to the recording of Gaelic place names and vocabulary and the development

          <P><strong>S2M-534#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>New 
            Forth Crossing</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the proposal 
            by the Leader of Fife Council that planning and preparation now be 
            undertaken for the construction of a further crossing over the River 
            Forth; notes that the existing Forth Road Bridge required in excess 
            of 16 years lead-in time before it was built and that traffic levels 
            on the current bridge continue to grow well beyond the recommended 
            capacity of 68,000, increasing pollution over the Forth, placing a 
            severe brake on economic links to the north of Scotland and thereby 
            making the economic and environmental case for ensuring that the new 
            crossing combines both road and tram or rail freight traffic indisputable, 
            and further notes the benefits to economic development and employment 
            in Scotland of designing and building a new Forth crossing.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-533</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Draft 
            Budget (Scotland) Act 2003 Amendment (No.2) Order 2003</strong>-That 
            the Finance Committee recommends that the draft Budget (Scotland) 
            Act 2003 Amendment (No.2) Order 2003 be approved.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-532</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Antisocial

            to the general principles of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) 
            Bill.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Cathy Jamieson, Peter Peacock, Ross Finnie, Mrs Mary

          <P><strong>S2M-531</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Evening 
            Express Aberdeen Champions Awards</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the winners of the Evening Express Aberdeen Champions awards, which 
            recognise their immense contributions to North East Scotland society 
            and commends the newspaper for running these awards.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-530</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>New 
            York Crime Success</strong>-That the Parliament notes the publication 
            of the <em>Crime in the United States</em> report by the Federal Bureau 
            of Investigation; congratulates New York City on becoming the safest 
            large city in America as crime has dropped 5% this year to its lowest 
            level since the 1960s; recognises that this impressive record is largely 
            due to the &quot;broken windows&quot; approach adopted which has led 
            to &quot;zero tolerance&quot; neighbourhood policing based on the 
            idea that no act of crime, no matter how small, should be ignored, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase the resources available 
            to our overstretched criminal justice system and to learn from the 
            New York experience by introducing directly elected conveners of police 
            boards who would be accountable to their local communities through 
            regular publication of localised crime statistics, based on &quot;Compstat&quot;, 
            and would therefore be able to respond to the public's expressed desire 
            for such &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policing in Scotland, along with 
            a far more visible police presence on our streets.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-529</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Education 
            (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the 
            Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Education (Additional 
            Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Euan Robson</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-528#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Collateral 
            Damage</strong>-That the Parliament recalls the concerns of Save the 
            Children before the war with Iraq that half the Iraqi population was 
            comprised of children under the age of 14, that 70% of the population 
            lived in towns and cities, that 60% were poor and dependent on food 
            rations, that 11.4% of Iraq children in north Iraq and 23.1% in central 
            and south Iraq were chronically malnourished, that under-five child 
            mortality rates in central and south Iraq had deteriorated by 160% 
            due to sanctions, that Iraqi children were forced to drink water often 
            containing up to 10 times the acceptable level of contamination and 
            that the number of internally displaced persons was, before military 
            action, estimated to be between 700,000 and one million; notes that, 
            against that background, Save the Children was "deeply concerned" 
            at renewed conflict as military action would have serious humanitarian 
            consequences for that nation's vulnerable children; notes that Save 
            the Children's fears have been realised and that since the war the 
            plight of Iraq's children has worsened; notes that it is estimated 
            that there are 120,000 orphans in Iraq, many of whom live on the streets 
            and for whom the coalition provides no support; applauds the actions 
            of Susan Karim who has lived in Scotland since fleeing Saddam Hussein's 
            regime in 1980 and who, from 18 to 29 October 2003 will complete a 
            solo sponsored walk from Dundee to the Scottish Parliament on her 
            &quot;Long Journey to Iraq&quot; to highlight the orphaned children 
            of Iraq and to collect funds for the Almuroge Project in Baghdad, 
            a project requiring £100,000 to re-open a closed orphanage that would 
            provide a home for 1,000 orphans as well as 150 elderly people who 
            have lost all family ties, and therefore considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should follow her individual example by promoting and encouraging, 
            by whatever means at its disposal, humanitarian aid for the displaced 
            children and elderly people of Iraq.</P>

            in opposing the introduction by the Home Office of a £250 charge for 
            non-EU international students to stay in the United Kingdom and notes 
            that these charges damage the UK's status as an attractive place to 
            study for international students and run contrary to Her Majesty's 
            Government's policy of attracting more international students to the

          <P> <strong>S2M-525#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 
            Crossrail Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the benefits 
            of introducing the proposed Glasgow Crossrail scheme in respect of 
            both the local and national rail network; notes that the scheme would 
            help to provide a fast, effective rail service into the city centre; 
            appreciates that the crossrail scheme would help to open up Glasgow 
            Airport to the whole of Scotland in conjunction with the proposed 
            Glasgow Airport rail link and allow improvements to Ayrshire and coastal 
            services to be implemented along with projects in the Central Scotland 
            Transport Corridor Studies document, including the Airdrie to Bathgate 
            rail link; is aware of the value for money and cost efficiency of 
            the Glasgow Crossrail proposal with the need to construct only a minimal 
            amount of new track; acknowledges the potential of the scheme to encourage 
            more commuters to move from car to rail transport, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should progress this proposal as expeditiously 
            as possible.</P>

            for both brain injury victims and their families and carers; recognises 
            the importance of the continuation of the existing grant under section 
            10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to Headway Scotland in allowing 
            them to continue and improve the crucial role already being filled 
            by them, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to give assurances 
            that these services are allowed to continue, unhindered by fears over

            of this community care grant.</P>

            Screen to ascertain whether further public funding to this project

            to a planning application to build a golf course and hotel at Park 
            of Keir on greenbelt land between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan, contrary 
            to the existing development plan, and as such the application will 
            now go before Scottish ministers, and believes that there is sufficient 
            public concern and confusion over the decision-making process in this 
            particular case to warrant the holding of a public local inquiry by 
            the Executive's Reporter so that future decisions on the merits of 
            this application are seen to be open and transparent and so that confidence 
            in the planning process can be restored.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-513#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>A80 
            Public Inquiry</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should delay the orders for the upgrading of the existing 
            A80 road and instead hold a public inquiry with the remit to undertake 
            a full-scale, comprehensive and objective assessment of the costs 
            and benefits of both the A80 upgrade and the alternative Kelvin Valley 
            route for a new motorway, including a comparison between the economic 
            and environmental impacts of both options.</P>

            for the Scottish passenger rail franchise by three months in light 
            of the current changes in the rail industry and thus allow for a period 
            of adjustment.</P>

          <P> <strong>S2M-424#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Wind 
            Farms</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the proliferation 
            of planning applications for onshore wind farms throughout Scotland; 
            is further concerned, whilst supporting renewable energy, about the 
            environmental and landscape impact of wind farms and understands that 
            these frequently face vigorous local opposition; believes that the 
            current planning regime provides inadequate guidance to local authorities, 
            communities and developers in relation to the siting of wind farms; 
            considers that the Scottish Executive should bring forward as a matter 
            of urgency new planning guidance on the siting of wind farms taking 
            proper account of these factors, and further considers that the Executive 
            should declare a moratorium on the determination of locally-opposed 
            wind farm planning applications until such guidance has taken effect.</P>
