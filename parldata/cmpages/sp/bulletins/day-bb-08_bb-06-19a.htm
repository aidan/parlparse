<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Ministerial Statement: Financial Outturn 2007-08</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Government Debate: Youth Justice&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2204</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Youth Justice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the positive contribution that children and young people across Scotland make to society; believes that every young person deserves the best start in life; is committed to giving young people more positive choices and chances and removing the barriers that prevent some from realising their potential and leading successful lives; notes that there are a number of young people who do not realise their potential and get into trouble and recognises the need to intervene quickly and effectively to turn their lives around; further recognises the need to support victims of offending, and considers that communities, the third sector, the private sector, public services, local authorities and the Scottish Government need to work together to build a more successful Scotland by preventing offending and intervening early with children and families at risk. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2204.2</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Youth Justice</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2204) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;and, while recognising the demand for services and initiatives to prevent young people offending and re-offending, considers that the criminal justice system must also seek to deal with those offenders who persist in breaking the law and disrupting communities; further recognises the important role of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2003; believes the youth court pilots have been successful and calls for further rolling out of youth courts across Scotland, and further believes that the Scottish Government should ensure adequate funding is in place to support youth services and the youth justice system across Scotland.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2204.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Youth Justice</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2204) in the name of Fergus Ewing, after &quot;around&quot; insert &quot;notes with concern the failure of the previous administration to reduce persistent young offending by 10% and recognises the increasing drain on time and resources that offence referrals are having on the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration (SCRA); recommends that an increase in disposals available to SCRA, such as an extension of drug treatment and testing orders, would enable it to intervene more effectively; recognises that the sending of 14 and 15-year-old persistent young offenders to youth courts would allow children&rsquo;s panels to concentrate more on referrals for non-offence grounds.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2204.3</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle: Youth Justice</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2204) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;calls on the Scottish Government to introduce children&rsquo;s rights impact assessments to show how government decisions impact on the rights and wellbeing of children; notes that young people are themselves often the victims of crime and therefore calls for the extension of the Scottish Crime Survey to under 16s; believes that young people must be engaged fully in the ongoing review of the national antisocial behaviour strategy including improving the provision of diversionary activities; calls for increased involvement of young people in delivering solutions to youth crime through innovative measures such as a youth justice board and youth justice panels, and calls for an end to the use of all ultra-sonic &quot;Mosquito&quot; dispersal devices.&quot; </p>
