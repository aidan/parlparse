            Kenneth Macintosh: Autism Awareness Week (14-20 May 2001)</strong>—That 
            the Parliament joins with The National Autistic Society Scotland, 
            the Scottish Society for Autism and all other autism organisations 
            across Scotland and the UK in highlighting Autism Awareness Week (14 
            to 20 May 2001); recognises in particular the challenges faced by 
            adults on the autistic spectrum, and their families, in gaining appropriate 
            support from the statutory services, and acknowledges the need to 
            pursue the principles of the <i>The same as you? A review of services 
            for people with learning disabilities</i> to ensure that adults with 
            autism and Asperger’s syndrome have access to wide-ranging and good 
            quality services to meet their needs.</font></p>

            win in the final of the BT Cellnet Bowl at Murrayfield Stadium on 
            Saturday 28 April 2001, a competition open to all club rugby teams 
            in Scotland; commiserates with the opponents, Cartha Queens Park Rugby 
            Club, who are three divisions above Lenzie yet were on the receiving 
            end of the &quot;Lomu Ball&quot; manoeuvre from Ross Queenan and his

          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1906</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Holding 
            Plenary Meetings of the Parliament in Stirling</strong>—That the Parliament 
            recognises that it must investigate alternative temporary accommodation 
            for May 2002 when the Church of Scotland is expected to require the 
            use of the Assembly Hall for its General Assembly and calls upon the 
            Parliamentary Bureau to consider Stirling as a potential location 
            given its modern facilities, historic past, central location, excellent 
            transport links and the fact that it has already hosted meetings of 
            parliamentary committees.</font></p>

          <p> <font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1904</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Replacement 
            of "Visitscotland" Name</strong>—That the Parliament demands that the name 
            &quot;visitscotland&quot; be phased out and replaced with its former 
            name, the Scottish Tourist Board, for clarity; considers that &quot;visitscotland&quot; 
            is a fatuous affectation which will make Scottish tourism information 
            harder to find; points out that tourists from countries are accustomed 
            to seeking information under S for Scotland or T for tourism and that 
            many tourists are not visiting Scotland but actually live here and 
            visit other parts of their country, and notes, as an indication of 
            how confusing the name change has been, that the media feel it necessary 
            to explain that visitscotland means the Scottish Tourist Board on 
            almost every occasion the name &quot;visitscotland&quot; is used.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1903#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Threatened

            <a name="MotionText">notes with great concern the proposal to sell 
            off the Kelvin Hall International Sports Arena in Glasgow; recognises 
            that the Kelvin Hall is a much loved and vital public sports facility 
            and that its closure would lead to a serious decline in the provision 
            of sports facilities for local people, and therefore urges the Scottish 
            Executive to make urgent representations to Glasgow City Council to 
            prevent the closure of the Kelvin Hall.</a></font></p>
