            it has given to the case of <em>Gray </em>v<em> MacLeod </em>(SLT 17) 
            where the sheriff, when faced with the proposition that a march fence 
            type boundary wall was owned to the mid-point only (&#145;<em>ad medium 
            filum</em>&#146;), stated in his written opinion "There has been long-standing 
            doubt as to whether this is correct as a proposition of law" (p.20 
            of <em>Scots Law Times, 1979) </em>and then went on to make it clear 
            that there was an alternative proposition which denoted the boundary 
            wall was held as common property <em>pro indiviso</em>.</p>

            it has given to the case of <em>Gill </em>v<em> Mitchell </em>regarding 
            a march fence type boundary wall where the sheriff, when no titles 
            were produced, stated he was faced with a difference of opinion, when 
            falling back on common law, as to whether the wall was held &#145;<em>ad 
            medium filum</em>&#146; or as &#145;common property <em>pro indiviso</em>&#146; 
            and while he himself preferred the &#145;<em>ad medium filum</em>&#146; 
            view, the &#145;common property&#146; view had judicial support (pages

            of confusion by the Scottish Law Commission which was extant in the 
            period 1990-93 and of the Commission's statement that there are two
