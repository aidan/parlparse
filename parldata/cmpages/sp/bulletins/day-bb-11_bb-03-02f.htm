<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-8052 Mary Scanlon: Support for The Highlanders&rsquo; Museum, Fort George</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the work being undertaken to redevelop the Highlanders&rsquo; Museum, based in Fort George near Inverness; welcomes that over &pound;1.65 million has already been raised toward its &pound;3 million target; notes that after the project is complete it is hoped that the museum will contribute an additional &pound;400,000 annually to the economy of the Highlands and Islands; recognises that the museum is home to the largest regimental collection of historic artefacts in Scotland and considers that the deterioration of this collection will be halted by this project; further notes that the project depends on the support of the Scotland Committee of the Heritage Lottery Fund at its meeting in June 2011 to go ahead, and commends the project to the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8051 Anne McLaughlin: Human Rights for All in Uganda</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern reports of the ongoing increase in homophobia in Uganda following the murder of the gay rights activist, David Kato, and the proposed plans to introduce the Anti-Homosexuality Bill; opposes all human rights abuses on the basis of sexual orientation and condemns the discrimination, threats and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Uganda; reaffirms its commitment to respect all human beings regardless of age, disability, sexual orientation, gender or race, and calls on the Ugandan authorities to ensure a credible and impartial investigation into the death of David Kato, reject laws that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and reaffirm their commitment to upholding the human rights of every citizen.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-8024 *#* Willie Coffey: The Co-operative Model, Born in Fenwick, 14 March 1761, Still Flourishing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates the 250th anniversary of the founding of the Fenwick Weavers Society in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun village of Fenwick as a significant milestone in the development of co-operative enterprises in Scotland and throughout the world; welcomes plans to recognise the founding of the society, which was recorded in the signing of a charter in Fenwick Parish Church on 14 March 1761, in a range of projects organised by the modern-day Fenwick Weavers Society in co-operation with East Ayrshire Council and with the support of a wide range of funders; notes that the projects will include the building of a commemorative wall on the spot in Fenwick where the weavers held their parliament and by the signing of a modern Fenwick Charter, to take place in the same church on 14 March 2011; further notes that the Fenwick Weavers Society has been described as &quot;the oldest example of distributive Co-operation of which there is documentary evidence&quot; and also as &quot;probably the pioneer of what is now described as the &lsquo;Co-operative supply association&rsquo;&quot;; highlights that among those signing the Fenwick Charter will be Scots from all walks of life including Scotland&rsquo;s growing co-operative sector, representatives of UK co-operative bodies, including Co-operatives UK and the Co-operative Group, the president and director general of the International Co-operative Alliance and a representative of the MONDRAGON Corporation, a co-operative group founded in 1956 that now has over 85,000 employees and plants in 18 countries, the largest business group in the Basque Country and seventh largest in Spain; applauds the fact that the worldwide co-operative movement, of which the early roots are in Fenwick, now brings together over one billion members, providing in excess of 100 million jobs, and considers that, in addition to being an important part of Scotland&rsquo;s history, co-operative enterprises offer Scotland a viable, efficient and accountable means of organising to produce goods and services for their members, for the wider Scottish community and for export.</p>
