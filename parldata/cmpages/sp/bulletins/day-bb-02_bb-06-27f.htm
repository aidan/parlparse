          <p><strong>*S1M-3263</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Development 
            of RAF Turnhouse Site</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            BAA Lynton has earmarked the former RAF Turnhouse site or &quot;Airwest&quot; 
            for medium- to long-term commercial development in support of the 
            expanding cargo operations at Edinburgh Airport following the grant 
            of outline planning consent in June 2000; further notes that the entire 
            site is currently being marketed to potential commercial occupiers 
            for a variety of airport-related uses; expresses its concern that 
            Home Office plans for a possible accommodation centre for asylum seekers 
            on that site are creating uncertainty and thus the site is in danger 
            of becoming blighted, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            and the City of Edinburgh Council to ask the Home Office to state 
            clearly that it has no interest in the site and thereby permit BAA 
            Lynton to proceed with its plans which are in the best interest of 
            jobs and economic development in Edinburgh and the east of Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: David McLetchie*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3261</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Dunino Primary 
            School's Third Eco-Award</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            Dunino Primary School, Fife, on being the only school in mainland 
            Scotland to be awarded three Eco-Schools Friendly Flags by the European 
            Commission, the latest for its work on marine pollution.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3260</strong> <strong>Colin Campbell: Non-Use of Anti-Social 
            Behaviour Orders by Inverclyde Council</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes that Inverclyde Council has not utilised anti-social behaviour 
            orders; believes that this is a deliberate decision on its part, and 
            further believes that anti-social behaviour in Inverclyde will not 
            be eliminated unless and until Inverclyde Council utilises all the 
            legal means available to it.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3256.1</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Better Communities 
            in Scotland: Closing the Gap</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
            (S1M-3256) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from &quot;warmly&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;notes with disappointment the content of the 
            Scottish Executive&#146;s community regeneration statement <em>Better 
            Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap</em>; believes that community 
            regeneration is a topic worthy of serious consideration, and demands 
            that the Executive go back to the drawing board and come back when 
            it has some well thought out, workable solutions to the problems faced 
            by Scotland&#146;s deprived communities.&quot; </p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3256.2</strong> <strong>Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh: Better 
            Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
            to motion (S1M-3256) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out 
            from &quot;warmly&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the publication 
            of the Scottish Executive&#146;s community regeneration statement 
            <em>Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap</em>; agrees that 
            despite past successes in community regeneration more needs to be 
            done to improve the quality of life of people in Scotland&#146;s deprived 
            areas; notes the Executive&#146;s worthwhile aim of empowering professionals 
            and communities to resolve local problems but considers that its bureaucratic, 
            centralising approach fails to shift the emphasis of regeneration 
            away from traditional government-imposed structures; notes that <em>Better 
            Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap</em> contains no meaningful 
            proposals to measure the success or failure of regeneration initiatives, 
            and calls upon the Executive to implement a genuinely diverse approach, 
            independent of government, to empower families, communities, local 
            voluntary organisations and professionals to take action to resolve 
            the difficulties faced by Scotland&#146;s deprived communities.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3256.3</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Better Communities 
            in Scotland: Closing the Gap</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
            (S1M-3256) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, <a name="AmendmentText">leave 
            out from &quot;warmly&quot; to end and insert &quot;condemns the Scottish 
            Executive&#146;s failure to address the growing gap in Scotland between 
            the &#145;Haves&#146; and the &#145;Have Nots&#146;; believes that 
            this failure exposes a lack of political courage and an inability 
            to introduce radical income and wealth redistribution measures for 
            fear of offending the millionaire and big business minority on whose 
            behalf the New Labour and Liberal Democrat Executive appears to govern 
            Scotland; further condemns the Executive&#146;s record on tackling 
            Scotland&#146;s shameful child and pensioner poverty levels, and believes 
            that replacing the unfair council tax with a redistributive and progressive 
            personal income-based Scottish service tax would effectively close 
            the gap in Scotland&#146;s communities.&quot;</a></p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3254#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Action Plan on 
            Organic Food and Farming for Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            <a name="MotionText">notes that the sale of organic food in the UK, 
            including Scotland, is increasing faster than in any other European 
            country; further notes that Scotland is well-suited to organic food 
            production; welcomes the adoption by the devolved administrations 
            in Wales and Northern Ireland of ambitious action plans to expand 
            organic food production*; further notes* the preparation of a plan 
            by Her Majesty's Government and its support for the development of 
            a European Union plan, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            support consumers and producers by preparing an action plan on organic 
            food and farming for Scotland.</a></p>
