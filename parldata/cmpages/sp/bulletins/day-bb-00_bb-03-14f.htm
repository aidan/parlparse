    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-657#</b> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Retention of the Agricultural Wages Board</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the unique position of workers in the agricultural and
    horticultural industries; notes that international agreements and conventions call for
    specific measures to set minimum terms and conditions for these workers; acknowledges the
    success of the Agricultural Wages Board (AWB) in Scotland in establishing a level playing
    field of minimum terms and conditions; is concerned that the abolition of the AWB or a
    reduction in its powers could lead to a reduction in wages and terms and conditions for
    some workers in these industries; supports the retention of the AWB, and believes that its
    remit should be extended to include consideration of pensions and to cover workers in
    agricultural and horticultural related work who are currently excluded from its remit.</p>
