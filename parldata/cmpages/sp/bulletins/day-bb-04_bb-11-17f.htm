          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2022#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Scottish History</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the educational and cultural benefits of promoting Scottish history from ancient to modern times in our schools; notes that this will allow pupils a greater understanding of Scotland in European and global contexts and will encourage a balanced perspective; appreciates that this will cultivate greater confidence and self-awareness in pupils, and considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate the level of Scottish history taught in our schools with a view to attaching greater importance to the subject.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2021</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Fluoride</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes recent reports that the Scottish Executive has decided not to include water fluoridation in the forthcoming Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; believes that the quality of research into the health impacts of drinking fluoride has been too poor to establish whether it is harmful or not; recognises that the European Convention on Human Rights clearly states that individuals have the right not be medicated without their consent; acknowledges the appalling state of oral health in Glasgow; welcomes the proposals on expanding access to dental services, maintaining good oral hygiene and tackling poor diet contained in NHS Greater Glasgow&rsquo;s Oral Health Strategy; urges NHS Greater Glasgow to rule out introducing fluoride to Glasgow&rsquo;s water supply, and calls on the Executive to categorically rule out fluoridation from all other future legislation.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2020</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Class Sizes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that class sizes in Scottish schools should be set at a national maximum level of 20 for non-practical classes and 15 or less for practical classes; condemns the Scottish Executive for failing to reach targets for maximum sizes in S1 and S2 Mathematics and English classes; calls on the Scottish Executive to provide a strategy, including a timescale, to implement those commitments already made for S1 and S2 Mathematics and English and the early stages of primary school and produce a longer-term strategy to reduce all class sizes to 20 for non-practical subjects in state schools, and considers that such a strategy should include teacher recruitment and retention in addition to a survey of school capacity.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2019#</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Hollybush House Appeal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should support the mental health charity Combat Stress&rsquo;s funding appeal for new accommodation in Hollybush House, Ayr, Scotland&rsquo;s only centre for combat-related stress, in order to meet the requirements of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001; notes that current Executive funding is only &pound;54,000 over the next three years, and believes that increased funding should be allocated as a mark of support and respect for Scottish troops in active service, in recognition of the anticipated increase in demand for mental health services amongst servicemen and women as a result of the current conflict and in order to demonstrate that the First Minister&rsquo;s support for Scottish troops is more than just words.</p>
