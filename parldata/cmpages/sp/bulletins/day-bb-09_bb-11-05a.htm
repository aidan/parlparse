<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Supporting Families&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-5112</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Supporting Families</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the family is the natural building block of our society; notes the significant pressures facing families in Scotland today arising from relationship breakdown, poverty, unemployment and substance abuse; regrets that one in four Scottish children is growing up in a single-parent household and that 137,000 Scottish children have no parent in work, and believes that action is required to improve parenting support, to expand the role of health visitors, to fully harness the voluntary sector in this work and to recognise marriage in the tax and benefits system. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5112.1</strong> <strong>Adam Ingram: Supporting Families</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5112) in the name of Elizabeth Smith, leave out from &quot;regrets&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Government should focus on addressing the impact of the recession and take steps to ease the burden on families; recognises that long-term relationships provide stability in many families and acknowledges the status of marriage in society, and believes that the needs and best interests of the child should always be at the centre of policies to support and promote stable families and reflect the reality of family life in Scotland.&quot; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-5112.1.1</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> Supporting Families&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-5112.1) in the name of Adam Ingram, insert at end &quot;and urges the Scottish Government to prioritise support for parents and extended families, ensuring that evaluation of these services is geared towards improving the quality and range of support that can be offered.&quot; </p>
      <p> <strong>S3M-5112.1.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> Supporting Families&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-5112.1) in the name of Adam Ingram, insert at end &quot;, and notes the valuable role of the voluntary sector in the delivery of services to children, parents and families, particularly those in vulnerable or disadvantaged circumstances.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by </em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Minimum Pricing of Alcohol&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-5118</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Minimum Pricing of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that alcohol misuse cost Scottish society an estimated &pound;2.25 billion in 2006-07, with almost one in three men and one in five women exceeding the recommended maximum level of consumption per week; believes that Scotland needs to examine its complex relationship with alcohol; further believes that to address this problem action needs to be taken that is properly targeted, effective, evidence based, and legally competent, and, accordingly, rejects the Scottish Government policy of minimum pricing on the basis that it will penalise responsible drinkers and damage Scotland&rsquo;s vital drinks industry. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5118.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Minimum Pricing of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5118) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out&nbsp;from &quot;action&quot; to end and insert&nbsp;&quot;effective enforcement of existing laws is needed, as is further action&nbsp;that is properly targeted, effective, evidence-based and legally competent, and, accordingly, is willing to examine, consider and debate all evidence and representations presented to it in seeking support for minimum pricing and the other measures in the Bill that will be introduced later&nbsp;in 2009.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5118.1</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie: Minimum Pricing of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5118) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;rejects&quot; to end and insert &quot;looks forward to considering the evidence of all the different approaches that can help to tackle the misuse of alcohol, and urges the Scottish Government to share the substance of all of the legal advice obtained.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5118.3</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Minimum Pricing of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5118) in the name of Murdo Fraser, insert at end &quot;and fails to recognise the role of individual responsibility or meet the key test of bringing about fundamental, rather than marginal, cultural change.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><strong>11.40 am</strong>&#9;General Question Time&mdash;</p>

<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Government Debate: Autumn Fisheries Negotiations&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-5119</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Autumn Fisheries Negotiations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to secure a fair deal at the forthcoming EU fisheries negotiations and to continue seeking radical and urgent changes to EU regulations to help cut discards and improve fisheries conservation and the industry&rsquo;s profitability; calls for&nbsp;Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen&rsquo;s growing reputation for innovative fisheries conservation to be given due recognition, and notes the European Commission Green Paper&nbsp;on the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, which recognises the failures of the&nbsp;Common Fisheries Policy. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5119.2</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Autumn Fisheries Negotiations</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5119) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;welcomes the meeting of Inter Regional Advisory Council members, stakeholders and fisheries ministers from across the United Kingdom in Edinburgh this week; notes the growing support for ecosystem-based regional fisheries management amongst fisheries experts and interests, and agrees that the Scottish Government should put in place effective measures to support Scottish fishing communities in light of the outcomes of last year&rsquo;s fisheries negotiations and the ongoing recession.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5119.1</strong> <strong>John Scott: Autumn Fisheries Negotiations</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5119) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end &quot;, and believes that, in that context, a more regionally responsible approach to fisheries management is required and that, in order to achieve this, the Scottish Government and HM Government must work together in the interests of a sustainable Scottish fishing industry.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5119.3</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur: Autumn Fisheries Negotiations</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5119) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the need for a complete overhaul of the Common Fisheries Policy and action to address the environmental and economic folly of discards; believes, however, that the Government&rsquo;s immediate priority must be to tackle the current crippling situation facing Scotland&rsquo;s fishing fleet and the prospect of further cuts in effort and quotas, and therefore urges the Scottish Government to work urgently and constructively with the fishing industry and the UK Government on priorities for the forthcoming EU fisheries negotiations to secure the best possible outcome for the Scottish fleet and the longer term sustainability of fish stocks.&quot;</p>
