          <p><strong>*S1M-2624</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Aung San Suu 
            Kyi and the Burmese Democracy Movement</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises that the people of Burma elected their representatives 
            in free and fair elections on 27 May 1990 and that these democratically-elected 
            representatives, including Aung San Suu Kyi, were denied their legitimate 
            right to serve as members of parliament and continue to be the only 
            democratically-elected parliamentarians in the world who are barred 
            from taking their oath of office; recognises that the Inter-Parliamentary 
            Union has cited the arresting, detaining and sentencing of duly elected 
            members of parliament under laws considered by the United Nations 
            Human Rights bodies to be in breach of international civil and political 
            rights standards (Resolution adopted by the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary 
            Union at its 165th Session, Berlin, 16 October 1999); recognises that 
            according to the National League for Democracy (NLD), which won 392 
            of the 485 seats in the 27 May 1990 elections, as many as 55 of the 
            elected representatives of the people of Burma were in detention as 
            of March 2000; recognises that conditions of detention are reported 
            to include torture, the lack of proper medical care and insufficient 
            food and that five elected members of the parliament have died while 
            in detention; recognises that the United Nations Commission on Human 
            Rights has cited &quot;increasingly severe and systematic violations 
            of human rights in Myanmar&quot; (United Nations Commission on Human 
            Rights, 55th session, 1999); recognises that the International Labour 
            Conference of the International Labour Organization has cited the 
            continued imposition of forced labour on the people of Myanmar by 
            the Ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) (Resolution 
            on the Widespread Use of Forced Labour in Myanmar, International Labour 
            Conference, 87th Session, Geneva, June 1999); therefore resolves to 
            join with other democratically-elected members of parliaments throughout 
            the world in declaring support for and solidarity with the elected 
            members of the parliament of Burma, and calls upon the military Government 
            of Burma to (a) release immediately and unconditionally all MPs-elect 
            and end all violations of human rights imposed on the people of Burma, 
            (b) recognise the right of the duly elected representatives of Burma 
            to convene the parliament and immediately cease all restrictions against 
            them and (c) agree to join the National League for Democracy and the 
            representatives of ethnic nationalities in a dialogue to achieve a 
            peaceful transition to democracy.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2623#</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Lifeline Air Links 
            to the Islands</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that the lifeline 
            air services to the Scottish islands are necessities, not luxuries; 
            believes that the commercial air fares charged by the airlines are 
            a tax on island life, handicapping individuals, businesses and public 
            bodies alike, and considers that the Scottish Executive should enter 
            into discussions with Her Majesty's Government and the airlines with 
            a view to using a Public Service Obligation subsidy to reduce the 
            airfares to a more reasonable level.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2622</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: Cross-Party 
            Support for a Review of the Construction Industry in Scotland</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the importance of the construction industry 
            to the Scottish economy and the contribution it makes to supporting 
            employment and vocational education and training; notes that nine 
            out of every 10 construction firms employ less than eight people; 
            acknowledges that the reputation of the whole industry is damaged 
            by the actions of rogue traders, particularly within the residential 
            sector, and that small businesses contend that their profitability 
            and competitiveness is adversely affected by the system of cash retentions, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should initiate a strategic 
            review of construction in Scotland in order to (a) identify how best 
            to combat the &quot;cowboy&quot; element, (b) support the education 
            and training infrastructure so that it is able to meet the skill requirements 
            of the industry, (c) examine the possibility of developing an inspection 
            and assessment regime to evaluate the competence of construction companies, 
            (d) address the system of cash retentions and (e) ensure that the 
            provisions within the existing construction contracts legislation 
            deliver a process that is fair, effective and easy to understand.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2621#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie: Fair Trade Fortnight</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that 4 - 17 March 2002 is Fair Trade Fortnight 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should endorse the use of 
            Fair Trade produce, in particular by encouraging schools to incorporate 
            Fair Trade as an element within their curricula and should promote 
            it through other activity.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2620</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Miners' Pension 
            Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the £8 million released 
            from Her Majesty's Treasury to miners' pension schemes; notes that 
            many ex-miners or widows of ex-miners are living in poverty while 
            HM Treasury receives £250 million per year from the profits of the 
            schemes; further notes that Her Majesty's Government will take over 
            £4 billion from the schemes, and demands that Her Majesty's Government 
            return all of the profits to the pension schemes to allow the ex-miners 
            and their families to receive the benefits of the scheme to which 
            they contributed to.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper, Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2619</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Public Appointments 
            (Parliamentary Approval) (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees to the general principles of the Public Appointments (Parliamentary 
            Approval) (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2618</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Remove the Shackles</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with regret the increasingly partisan approach 
            of Labour members to &quot;take note&quot; motions and motions for 
            members' business; is aware that of the 14 outstanding such motions 
            submitted by Liberal Democrat MSPs to attract signatures at 11 January 
            2002, 13 have attracted support from SNP members but none have the 
            support of their Labour coalition partners; realises that, in contrast, 
            of the 33 Labour motions, 23 have attracted Liberal Democrat, 31 SNP 
            and 19 Conservative support; acknowledges that of 70 SNP motions outstanding, 
            31 obtained Liberal Democrat, 19 Conservative but only 11 Labour support; 
            recognises that, when given, Labour support is token and comes from 
            only one or two members with specific constituency or special interests; 
            is surprised that even motions previously signed by Labour members 
            do not attract the same signatures when subsequently re-submitted 
            indicating a tightening of the Labour Whips' control; further acknowledges 
            that such an approach has meant no Labour backing at all for motions 
            on such issues as Female Genital Mutilation, International Year of 
            Mountains and Donald Whyte, Genealogist; believes that Labour Whips 
            are preventing Labour members from signing perfectly innocuous, non-partisan 
            motions and thus undermining the very ethos of the &quot;new politics&quot; 
            the Parliament should represent; expresses surprise at the lack of 
            self-confidence, lack of faith and insecurity that this approach displays; 
            accepts that while all parties have a right to express their views 
            robustly in the Chamber, in committees and in the media, there is 
            still room for cross-party co-operation on a host of issues, not least 
            those raised in members' business motions; commends Conservative, 
            Green, Independent, Liberal Democrat, SNP and SSP members for acting 
            in the true spirit of the Parliament in this regard but expresses 
            disappointment that Labour control freakery prevents Labour members 
            from doing likewise; considers that Labour members cannot reasonably 
            expect support from non-Labour members for their motions when they 
            have no intention of reciprocating, and therefore appeals to Labour 
            Whips to remove the shackles on their members to allow free expression 
            of support for non-partisan motions, and indeed members' Bills, on 
            their merits, before colleagues in other parties, irritated by Labour's 
            politically sectarian attitude, feel obliged to react in similar fashion.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2617</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Japan and Commercial 
            Whaling</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to request that Her Majesty's Government convey to the Japanese Government 
            in the strongest terms its opposition to a return to full-scale commercial 
            whaling and to request that the Japanese Government answers the allegation, 
            made in a report by Greenpeace, that it is using development aid to 
            buy votes in favour of a return to full-scale commercial whaling from 
            small nation states within the International Whaling Commission. <strong><em>

            Scottish Borders Council, Scottish Enterprise Dumfries and Galloway 
            and Scottish Enterprise Borders; notes its manifesto message &quot;Moving 
            the South of Scotland Forward&quot;; further notes its five key targets 
            of raising the profile and image of the south of Scotland, examining 
            and rectifying the causes of economic market failure, promoting inclusion 
            and equal opportunities, working for increased funding for the area 
            and building international links; recognises that this area in particular 
            has suffered from the consequences of foot-and-mouth disease and has 
            in the past been overlooked, and congratulates the South of Scotland 
            Alliance on its endeavours to rectify these matters.</p>

            of those who have died or suffered accidents or ill health as a result

            the euro to any of Oxfam Scotland's 68 shops; believes that Oxfam 
            Scotland will put such currency to very good use, once exchanged in 
            the developing world, and urges all those with soon-to-be useless 
            coins and small denomination notes, of any of the twelve EU member 
            states which have signed up to the euro, left over from holidays and

          <p><strong>S1M-2605</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Retain Clive 
            Fairweather</strong>-That the Parliament considers it to be in the 
            interests of justice and human rights that Clive Fairweather remains 
            as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland, and would 
            be deeply concerned had he wished to remain but any unjust interference 
            were found in whether his contract is renewed when it expires as Mr 
            Fairweather has been an exceptional watchdog in his outspoken honesty 
            and soundness of judgement on the state of Scottish Prisons; believes 
            that vulnerable prisoners, and staff concerned about conditions, depend 
            upon the integrity of Mr Fairweather who has used honest language 
            in condemning matters affecting human life such as the high rate of 
            suicides in prisons and in highlighting slopping out as a breach of 
            human rights, and has worked diligently both to protect the public 
            and to attempt to reform prisons, and calls upon all concerned in 
            this appointment under a Royal Warrant, including Her Majesty The 
            Queen, to ensure fairness prevails in appointing a key guardian in 
            the justice system.</p>

          <p><strong>S1M-2604</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Treatment of al-Qaeda 
            Prisoners of War</strong>-That the Parliament, while utterly condemning 
            the terrorist activities of al-Qaeda, deplores the refusal by the 
            United States of America to classify Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners 
            as Prisoners of War, thus denying their basic human rights as set 
            out under the Geneva Convention, and recognises that this kind of 
            action could lead to further acts of terrorism and is ultimately detrimental 
            to any attempts to reduce the threat of terrorism around the world.</p>

            World Summit on Sustainable Development (Rio + 10) in Johannesburg, 
            South Africa in September 2002 in order to represent the Scottish
