          <p><strong>S2M-977</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses' Pay and Conditions</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            that the job of nursery nurse represents one of the remaining professions 
            characterised by both an almost exclusively female workforce and an 
            overarching legacy of low pay; notes however, that the increased academic 
            and professional demands upon nursery nurses have been consistently 
            recognised by both the Parliament and wider society in recent months; 
            expresses concern that this consensual public recognition has not 
            been reflected in the form of an adequate and timely settlement for 
            those nursery nurses currently jeopardising their own financial security 
            in an attempt to obtain a remuneration package that fairly represents 
            their job and responsibilities; conveys regret that nursery nurses 
            have now voted overwhelmingly for indefinite strike action to begin 
            on 1 March 2004 that will result in widespread disruption to children's 
            education and massive inconvenience for parents; acknowledges that 
            this dispute represents a potential watershed not only for the future 
            of the nursery service and early years education but also for the 
            issue of equal pay in Scotland, and suggests that a possible route 
            to a satisfactory settlement would be a national review of the nursery 
            service followed by a Scotland-wide regrading of the role of nursery 
            nurses. </P>
