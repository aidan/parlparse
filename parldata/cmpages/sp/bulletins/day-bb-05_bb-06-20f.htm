          <p><strong> * S2M-2987# Fiona Hyslop: Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the recent publication of an economic impact assessment of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland at Ingliston which indicates that &pound;250 million is generated for the economy of which &pound;100 million supports the local Lothian economy; notes that 1.2 million visitors pass through the site each year; is concerned that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s White Paper, <em>The Future of Air Transport</em>, seeks to secure all of the 300-acre site for future development of Edinburgh Airport which threatens the future successful operation of the society and its year-round events; recognises the important role that the showpiece event, the Royal Highland Show, has for the farming sector, and, noting that this is an ideal site and that there will be a considerable expenditure from the public purse on public transport provision in the area, expresses its view that all parties concerned with economic, rural and transport interests should make further and urgent efforts to examine options for future co-existence of the society and Edinburgh Airport at Ingliston and make representations to the Secretary of State for Transport to achieve this.&nbsp; </p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2986 Malcolm Chisholm: Housing (Scotland) Bill&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Housing (Scotland) Bill.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2984 Patrick Harvie: United Kingdom&rsquo;s First Legal Humanist Marriage&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament welcomes the fact that on Saturday 18 June 2005 Scotland will see the first legal marriage to be conducted in the United Kingdom by a humanist celebrant; commends the decision by the Registrar General for Scotland to authorise 12 such celebrants to conduct civil marriages in Scotland; congratulates the Humanist Society of Scotland for its work in campaigning over many years for this change; considers that non-religious people wishing to mark their commitment to one another through marriage should enjoy the right to do so in keeping with their philosophical beliefs, and wishes the couple, Karen Watts and Martin Reins, every possible joy on this happy occasion.</p>
