<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3587</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Royal Mail Senior Management Pensions and the UK Government&rsquo;s Privatisation Plans</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the ongoing efforts of the UK Government to part-privatise the Royal Mail; notes that the stated impetus for this is the claimed shortfall in the Royal Mail pension fund; considers that, against this backdrop, the reported &pound;6 million paid into the pension plan of senior managers at the Royal Mail last year, reportedly double the payment of the previous year, is totally unjustified; notes that the chief executive of the Royal Mail, Adam Crozier, has reportedly accrued a &pound;1.1 million pension since joining the organisation in 2003, with a further &pound;1 million paid into a private fund; calls for the Royal Mail&rsquo;s senior management to reassess their own pension plan largesse; believes that the UK Government has made no convincing case for the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail; congratulates Geraldine Smith MP for lodging Early Day Motion 428 in the House of Commons on the issue of the Royal Mail privatisation, which had attracted the support of 164 MPs by 2 March 2009; agrees with the sentiments of Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, that these plans would &quot;nationalise the pension fund and privatise the profit&quot;; further believes that these plans are in fact motivated by Lord Peter Mandelson&rsquo;s zeal for privatisation, and considers that if the UK Government is so concerned about not having the funds required to maintain the Royal Mail as a public asset then it should ditch its ill-advised plans for identity cards, estimated to cost some &pound;5 billion, or their equally ill-advised plans for the renewal of Trident, estimated by some to cost &pound;70 billion or more.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3586</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade Universities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the University of Edinburgh on its fifth year as a leading Fairtrade University; notes that Dundee, Aberdeen, Heriot-Watt, Edinburgh Napier and St Andrews universities are all running events promoting Fairtrade Fortnight on their campuses; recognises the very positive impact that fair trade has on producers in developing countries, and urges all higher education institutions in Scotland to take steps to back the Fair Trade Nation campaign.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3585</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Prostate Cancer Awareness Month 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports The Prostate Cancer Charity in launching the It Matters campaign, during Prostate Cancer Awareness Month 2009, to highlight that more investment is needed to tackle prostate cancer; notes that 2,500 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year in Scotland and between 750 and 800 men die of the disease each year; calls on the Scottish Government to monitor prostate cancer patient experience through the Better Together programme; further notes that in order to decrease mortality from prostate cancer there is a need to invest in more research to develop a new generation test for prostate cancer capable of distinguishing between aggressive and slow-growing forms of prostate cancer, and further calls on the Scottish Government to play an active role in providing leadership in the global search for such a test.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3584</strong> <strong>Duncan McNeil on behalf of the Local Government and Communities Committee:</strong> <strong>National Planning Framework for Scotland 2 - Proposed Framework</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Local Government and Communities Committee&rsquo;s 5th Report, 2009 (Session 3): <em>National Planning Framework for Scotland 2: Proposed Framework </em>(SP Paper 218), together with the <em>Official Report</em> of the Parliament&rsquo;s debate on the report, should form the Parliament&rsquo;s response to the Scottish Government on the Proposed Framework.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3583</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Daily Record and Sunday Mail Newspapers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with extreme concern the announcement that up to a quarter of journalists at the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail </em>newspapers are to lose their jobs following the decision by Trinity Mirror to merge the two newsrooms; notes that the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail</em> are iconic titles and among Scotland&rsquo;s most read newspapers and that these job losses are occurring despite the titles representing one of the more profitable parts of the industry; believes that such a reduction in staffing is likely to affect the quality of journalistic output; recognises that this is a turbulent period in the newspaper industry and that a longer-term review of the needs of the media industry should be looked at; welcomes the recent summit facilitated by the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism and calls on the Scottish Government to continue to have dialogue with the industry in order to ensure that Scotland has a vibrant newspaper sector; welcomes the BBC&rsquo;s decision not to proceed with a local online news service as it would have impacted on the newspaper industry and local newspapers in particular, and calls on the industry not simply to respond to new technologies and challenges by cutting jobs but to consider longer-term solutions that maintain quality of output and a diverse newspaper industry.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3582</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Go4SET</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and supports the ongoing work of the Go4SET (go for science, engineering and technology) national programme, led by the Engineering Development Trust, in helping talented young people achieve their potential in engineering, science and technology careers; applauds the hard work and effort of the students of all the participating schools in developing their excellent projects in the area of sustainable engineering, as recognised at the Go4SET Edinburgh Celebration and Assessment Day, held on 24 February 2009 at the University of Edinburgh, and congratulates Balerno High School on being awarded the Best Overall Project award and Dollar High School for receiving the Innovation award.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3581</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>President Mugabe&rsquo;s Birthday Sinks Country Further into Destitution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the appalling behaviour of Robert Mugabe in marking his 85th birthday on 21 February 2009 with a sumptuous banquet in Harare as the start of a week of extravagant celebrations that included a $100-a-ticket gala dinner and advertised musical extravaganza; notes that Mr Mugabe&rsquo;s latest show of excess comes at the same time&nbsp;that Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Prime Minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, declared that&nbsp;it would take around &pound;3.5 billion to rehabilitate the country&rsquo;s collapsed health, social and education systems; deplores the involuntary removal of cattle and money from the starving people of Zimbabwe by their president and notes that each district was expected to donate 50 cattle and to raise $1,500 to go toward the week&rsquo;s celebrations, and finally calls for Mr Mugabe to honour the power-sharing agreement with Prime Minister Tsvangirai and work efficiently and cooperatively to rebuild their nation and bring their people out of destitution.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3579*&diams;</strong>* <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Cities and the Town Centre Regeneration Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of vibrant town centres up and down Scotland in increasing sustainable economic growth; recognises the importance of town centres for local residents and in attracting others to spend their money in the local community; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &pound;60 million Town Centre Regeneration Fund, which will provide a much needed boost to town centres that are feeling the ill effects of the current economic downturn; notes that many city-based town centres suffer from the draw of a large city centre and from out-of-town shopping centres, often leaving the most socially excluded residents in the area using a poor range of facilities; welcomes the Minister for Housing and Communities&rsquo; agreement to explore the prospect of city areas being able to apply for money from this fund, and believes that locations in Glasgow such as Springburn Shopping Centre and Victoria Road are just some examples of areas that could benefit.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3540*#*</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>The Future of Scottish Newspapers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent announcement by Trinity Mirror that a quarter of journalists at the <em>Daily Record</em> and the <em>Sunday Mail </em>will lose their jobs due to the newspapers merging; further notes that this follows on from proposed cutbacks in editorial staff at the Herald and Times Group and concerns about the future of other Scottish daily and weekly newspapers including Johnston Press, which owns the Fife Free Press Group; recognises that, while the crisis in the Scottish print media mirrors the situation worldwide with the economic downturn dramatically affecting circulation and advertising, the Scottish press faces particular difficulties including the loss of government advertising to the internet, and believes that the democratic process requires a vibrant Scottish newspaper sector with all sides working to minimise job losses and find long-term solutions.</p>
