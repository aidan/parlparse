            offending and disorder among young people, particularly persistent 
            offending by a very small minority of young people; recognises the 
            importance of early intervention measures, of youth work and of increased 
            sports, leisure and educational opportunities in enabling all young 
            people to fulfil their potential and to steering many young people 
            at risk of offending away from a life of crime; welcomes the proposals 
            to achieve these objectives including (a) mapping the coverage and 
            effectiveness of community-based programmes to tackle persistent offending, 
            (b) using the partnership opportunities provided by the multi-agency 
            youth justice teams to develop more systematic early intervention 
            measures and to improve the quality of information provided to the 
            children's hearing about the offending behaviour and how re-offending 
            could be prevented and (c) identifying how restorative justice approaches 
            can prevent the offender re-offending and build the confidence of 
            victims in our youth justice system and increase the safety of communities.

          <p><strong>*S1M-2519#</strong> <strong>Andrew Wilson: Scottish Number

            drawing public and parliamentary attention to the long-term condition 
            of asthma which affects over 400,000 people in Scotland; welcomes 
            the National Asthma Campaign's Asthma Audit 2001 and its survey of 
            asthma services in Scotland of winter 2000 which together, for the 
            first time, give a true indication of the work that still needs to 
            be done to tackle the condition, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to work with the National Asthma Campaign Scotland in its mission 
            to conquer asthma. </p>

            regret the decision by four senior consultants to leave the Beatson 
            Oncology Centre in Glasgow as a result of major difficulties in the 
            provision of cancer care services and low morale; notes that this 
            leaves the Beatson Oncology Centre with 10 vacant posts which seriously 
            impedes its ability to deliver cancer care and treatment, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to take decisive action to address the situation.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2514</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Tartan Army Award</strong>-That

            v Scotland world cup qualifier in September; notes that this award 
            is the latest in a string of accolades bestowed on Scottish football 
            fans; further notes that a record 15,000 Scotland supporters travelled
