          <p><strong>*S1M-2260</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie: Rural Economy</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the economic challenges confronting the rural 
            and more remote parts of Scotland and recognises the specific implications 
            of the Aggregates Tax for the quarrying industry in those areas.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2259</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan: Beautiful Scotland 
            in Bloom Awards</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Alness, 
            Ross-shire, for winning two awards in the Beautiful Scotland in Bloom 
            Competition 2001; notes that Alness has consistently come out top 
            in the Beautiful Scotland in Bloom and Britain in Bloom competitions 
            and that this is a tribute to the hard work and enthusiasm of the 
            whole team involved, and further congratulates the village of Kiltarlity 
            in Inverness-shire for winning the new entry trophy in the Beautiful 
            Scotland in Bloom Competition 2001 and wishes them success in future 
            competitions. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2258</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Saltire over 
            Edinburgh Castle</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the British 
            Army in its current recruiting campaign uses the Saltire to attract 
            young Scots; welcomes the recognition of this, the most potent symbol 
            of Scotland's nationhood, as a patriotic inspiration to Scots through 
            the centuries, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
            make representations to the British Army that, in the interest of 
            consistency, it should remove the Union Flag from the main flagpole 
            at the army barracks on Edinburgh Castle and raise in its place the 
            Saltire.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2257</strong> <strong>George Lyon: Fish Farming</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises the vital role fish farming plays in Scotland's 
            rural economy; notes the valuable contribution its exports make to 
            the Scottish economy; is concerned that the lack of insurance cover 
            for the destruction of fish killed under statutory disease eradication 
            schemes seriously undermines investor confidence, and therefore urges 
            the Scottish Executive to work with the industry in order to produce 
            such an insurance scheme.</p>
