<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4519</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>IKEA Plastic Bag Levy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates IKEA for introducing a plastic bag levy in all its stores across the United Kingdom; notes that this was after a successful two-year pilot at its Edinburgh store following the initial launch of a member&rsquo;s bill proposal for a levy on plastic bags in Scotland, and calls on other major retailers to introduce similar plastic bag levies.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4518</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Portessie Primary School - My Friend Needs A Teacher Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Portessie Primary School in Moray and other schools throughout Scotland as they campaign for global education through the My Friend Needs A Teacher campaign; supports the aims of the campaign to provide primary education by 2015 for the 100 million children who currently receive no form of teaching; congratulates the pupils and the school for their involvement in such a good cause, and agrees that the campaign should receive the backing of the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4517</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Highland Carers Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Highland Carers&rsquo; Project on the exhibition of photographs of Highland Carers, by Fin Macrae, on display in the Garden Lobby during Carers&rsquo; Week 2006 which takes place from 12 to 18 June; commends Fin for his fine work which celebrates carers as real people, young and old, with lives of their own alongside their caring roles, and urges all who can to study the exhibition and contemplate the contribution carers make to our society.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4516</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Diabetes Week - 11 to 17 June 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Diabetes Week 2006 which takes place from 11 to 17 June; welcomes this annual campaign by Diabetes UK which is important in increasing the public&rsquo;s knowledge of the condition; recognises the hard work of Diabetes UK in providing support for diabetics and their families and congratulates Diabetes UK for its provision of education and support services which have a very positive impact on people who suffer from diabetes and their families; further notes the specific work being done to raise awareness of the impact of diabetes on certain ethnic groups within Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive to continue to work with bodies such as Diabetes UK to reduce the number of people developing diabetes across the country.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4515#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Main Road and Rail Transport Links to the Highlands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the main trunk roads connections to the Highlands of Scotland, namely the A9 from Inverness to Perth, the A96 from Inverness to Aberdeen and the A82 from Inverness to Glasgow, should be the subject of major improvements, to be carried out in accordance with a long-term transport projects plan; believes that the rail links to Inverness are inadequate and should be improved; considers that a national consensus should be established to agree these objectives, and, in the case of the A96 and the A9, believes that the ultimate objective should be to dual these trunk routes.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4507.1</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Climate Change</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4507) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the publication of <em>Changing Our Ways: Scotland&rsquo;s Climate Change Programme </em>as a positive step towards addressing climate change; notes and welcomes the identification of the Scottish Share of carbon savings and the setting of a Scottish Target; recognises that it is the poor of the world who disproportionately bear the brunt of climate change events while it is the rich who disproportionately are the cause of climate change; recognises that governments must protect their poorer communities from the impacts of climate change while addressing the neo-liberal economic policies that cause climate change, and calls on the Scottish Executive to protect the homes of vulnerable communities in Scotland, to reverse its policies on road building and invest in a properly integrated public transport system, to invest in a publicly owned railway system including freight rail, to invest in renewable energy development that encompasses all types of renewable energy, unequivocally to ditch the notion of nuclear energy, to introduce energy efficiency measures in industry and business, to introduce energy efficiency measures in house building to address fuel poverty, to stop house building in flood plain areas, properly to invest in river management, to stop the building of luxury golf courses for the rich which are detrimental to the environment, to invest in organic farming to reduce the reliance on chemicals from the petrochemical industry, to invest in locally grown food in order to reduce the number of miles our food travels and the amount of packaging waste produced and properly to invest in reduced reuse and recycle facilities rather than landfill.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4507.3</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Climate Change</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4507) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;recognises that Scotland requires many of the political powers currently reserved to the UK Government in order to build a low-carbon society and make a greater contribution to the global effort towards tackling climate change; regrets the ongoing delay in publishing the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s energy efficiency strategy; calls for the establishment of a single high-profile public sector organisation to provide a one-stop shop for the promotion of energy efficiency across all sectors; urges Scottish Ministers when reporting annually to the Parliament to publish the carbon costs and savings that have resulted from their policies, and rejects the view that new nuclear power stations offer a solution to climate change.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4507.4</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Climate Change</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4507) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;as a serious response&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that CO2 emissions from Scotland have not fallen since the current First Minister took office; is concerned that Scotland&rsquo;s emissions reduction since 1990 lags behind that of England;&nbsp;notes that according to the Scottish Executive about half of Scotland&rsquo;s emissions reduction is due to the decline of heavy industry and not due to Executive policy measures; recognises that emissions from energy use and transport, accounting for over half of Scotland&rsquo;s emissions, have been increasing since 1990; is concerned that there are devolved policy measures that will result in greenhouse gas emissions that have been ignored by the Executive&rsquo;s Climate Change Programme, such as motorway building and subsidies for air transport which are likely to negate savings made under the Executive&rsquo;s Scottish Share; warns the Executive that unless the Scottish Share applies to all policy measures and is part of an identifiable overall target for emissions reduction it will be meaningless; calls on the Executive to implement fully the recommendations of the&nbsp;Parliament&rsquo;s Environment and Rural Development Committee&rsquo;s <em>5th Report, 2005: Report on&nbsp;Inquiry into Climate Change</em>, including traffic reduction and energy efficiency targets; agrees with the Executive that mainstreaming climate thinking, through the carbon proofing of new policies and measures, is vital to ensuring an effective climate change response, and therefore calls on the Executive to implement carbon proofing immediately starting with all existing policies and projects.&quot;</p>
