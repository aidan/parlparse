<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4850</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Further Congratulations to Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the City of Aberdeen and Aberdonians for their success in winning the city category in the Britain in Bloom awards, which follows on from their recent victory in the Scotland in Bloom awards.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4849</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Remarks by US Deputy Secretary of State on Pakistan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament utterly condemns the remarks attributed to US Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, by Pakistan&rsquo;s President; believes that threats to bomb Pakistan back into the stone age are offensive and dangerous, though unfortunately typical of the United States of America&rsquo;s current approach to foreign policy; wishes to assure Scotland&rsquo;s Pakistani community that the Scottish Parliament distances itself from such an approach to &quot;diplomacy&quot;, and calls on the Westminster Government to do likewise.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4848</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>VAT Fraud and the Poll Tax</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Eurocanet estimates that the UK Exchequer was defrauded of &pound;8.4 billion in VAT payments last year; is concerned that HM Revenue and Customs has only 1,400 staff working to identify and eliminate VAT fraud whilst thousands of local government staff and sheriff officers are still engaged in trying to collect &pound;437 million in outstanding poll tax debts; believes that this represents a misuse of resources in that such debts are unlikely to be recovered 16 years after the poll tax was abolished, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to cancel all outstanding poll tax debts and to work with the UK Government to increase the staff resources allocated to VAT fraud elimination.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4847</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Justice 1 Committee considers the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 in the following order: sections 1 to 5, sections 7 to 66, section 6, section 67, schedule and sections 68 to 71.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4846</strong> <strong>Brian Adam on behalf of the Standards and Public Appointments Committee:</strong> <strong>Breach of the Code of Conduct for MSPs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 2nd Report, 2006 (Session 2) of the Standards and Public Appointments Committee, <em>Complaint against Mike Pringle MSP </em>(SP Paper 636) and agrees to impose the sanction recommended in the report that Mike Pringle MSP be excluded from all meetings of the Parliament and all meetings of its committees for the first five sitting days immediately after this motion is agreed.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4845</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>ADHD Awareness Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 18 to 24 September 2006 is the first national ADHD Awareness Week, which takes as its theme &quot;ADHD is REAL&quot;; congratulates groups such as Falkirk-based Ecosse Adders, set up to promote awareness of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and to provide information and free practical help to sufferers, both adults and children, and their families; notes the increasing recognition that ADHD is under-diagnosed and that it may affect 5% of the population; further notes that with appropriate help most hyperactive children will settle down and catch up with learning and social interaction by the time they reach their mid-teens, and believes that the Scottish Executive should promote public awareness and better understanding of ADHD and ensure that those affected have access to appropriate advice and support.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4844</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Education Committee considers the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 in the following order: sections 1 to 8, sections 47 to 63, section 79, sections 9 to 46, sections 64 to 78 and sections 80 to 113 and that each schedule is considered immediately after the section that introduces it.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4842</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Action on Positional Plagiocephaly</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the growth in the number of reported cases of positional plagiocephaly in babies in Scotland since 1995; acknowledges that this cranial disorder, which makes the back or side of a baby&rsquo;s head appear flattened, is mainly caused by outside pressure placed on the skull and is generally associated with the prolonged periods of time that babies can spend with their heads resting in one position; accepts that the increasing incidence of the disorder has been linked to the success of parental guidance on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), urging parents to place babies on their backs to sleep; recognises that early interventions are possible to prevent or correct plagiocephaly which, most importantly, do not negate the significance of SIDS advice; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s action to develop, with NHS Health Scotland, a leaflet to advise new parents of these interventions, and believes, however, that this action should be supplemented with properly constituted research into the treatment of this condition, including the potential use of cranial remoulding orthoses and more detailed guidance for NHS staff, particularly at primary care level, to allow for more timely diagnosis and treatment of positional plagiocephaly.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4841</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Perth and Kinross Cittaslow Bid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the commitment and ambition being shown by Perth and Kinross Council and Scottish Enterprise Tayside in their aim to make Perth Scotland&rsquo;s first Cittaslow town and Perth and Kinross the first Cittaslow area in the United Kingdom; notes that Cittaslow, which has grown out of the Slow Food movement, is a network of over 100 towns across Europe that have committed themselves to promoting a healthier way of life through encouraging healthy eating, protecting the environment, promoting local produce and local traditions and enhancing the quality of the urban fabric; recognises that over 60 detailed criteria have to be met to be accepted into Cittaslow membership; believes that being part of the Cittaslow network would help Perth and Perth and Kinross to increase demand for local produce and endorse the excellent environmental qualities of the area; supports the drive by Perth and Perth and Kinross towards Cittaslow membership, and further believes that they can provide a model that other Scottish towns and communities can follow to eventually establish a strong network of Cittaslow towns across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4840</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Hugo Chavez</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hugo Chavez, democratically elected president of the Bolivarian Socialist Republic of Venezuela, on his address to the United Nations in New York, where he described George Bush as a &quot;devil&quot; in international terms and the greatest threat to peace and security across the planet; condemns the plans expressed by the United States of America to undemocratically undermine the Chavez government in Venezuela, and applauds the Venezuelan Government&rsquo;s commitment to anti-poverty and democratic policies and to world peace.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4836</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Avon Gorge Road</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the increased use of the Grangemouth rail freight terminal by Tesco; recognises that this will have environmental benefits for the people of Scotland but believes that some of the benefits will be offset by over 200 lorries passing through the Braes villages on a road that is not suitable for such an increase in heavy traffic, particularly at the notorious Avon Gorge, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work closely with Falkirk Council, West Lothian Council and the communities on both sides of the Avon Gorge to make sure that the main Falkirk to Bathgate road is fit for purpose, with the building of a bridge at the Avon Gorge which will accommodate the expected increase in lorry traffic.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4833<> </strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>School Bus Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that in certain local authority areas in Ayrshire and elsewhere there is a concern about the need to tighten up the rules and guidelines regarding the safety of buses carrying children to school and, in particular, believes that the regulations should be changed so that it is mandatory for a supervising adult to accompany primary school children travelling on a school bus whether the bus is a single or double decker.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4831#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Dental Health Services Research Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Dental Health Services Research Unit (DHSRU), based in Dundee University, on its various achievements in the last year, especially in winning, with collaborators, a &euro;1.8 million grant known as EGOHID II and the SCOT (Scottish Collaboration of Trialists) award of &pound;1.2 million; notes with pleasure the joint initiative of the University of Dundee and NHS Highland in their preparations for the appointment of a new Professor of Public Health Research and Consultant in Dental Public Health, and applauds the DHSRU&rsquo;s international recognition and invited involvement in National Institutes of Health funding for specific Cochrane Oral Health Group reviews in the area of oral cancer, its European Union funding with the University of Lyon and a range of partners across Europe to develop and operationalise European global oral health indicators across 25 member states, its invitation from the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry to help set out the direction of travel to protect oral health in the vulnerable child and its central involvement with US and Scandinavian partners in the International Caries Detection and Assessment System Group.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4829</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Football in the Community Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the joint working of the First Base Agency, an agency working in the sphere of drug and alcohol support and based in Dumfries, and Gretna Football Club&rsquo;s Football in the Community Programme, using the prestige of the football club to promote positive messages to young people; also recognises similar good work by many other football clubs, using their name to attract young people to take part in constructive educational or recreational activities and anti-drugs and alcohol campaigns, and believes that some of the public money provided for activities of this sort could achieve excellent results and best value by being channelled into schemes which bring together the Scottish Executive, football clubs, local authorities and voluntary organisations to work with young people and attract additional funding from other commercial and charitable sources.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4823</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Pay Up for Equal Pay</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses profound concern that local authorities have still not achieved equal pay for women despite decades of legislative requirement and a specific seven-year commitment included in the single status agreement; is appalled that, through the failure of authorities and government to plan for and resource equal pay, workers across Scotland, including women workers who are already low paid, are facing pay cuts and people who depend on services are facing service cuts; believes that, given the comparatively low levels of pay in Scotland for all workers, equal pay should be achieved by levelling up rather than down and that local authorities and the Scottish Executive have a duty to make the funding available to achieve that by negotiation; considers that, if sufficient funding is not made available, the employers and the Executive will be culpable for the industrial disputes and legal challenges that arise, and believes that it is in the Executive&rsquo;s and local authorities&rsquo; interests to avoid such disputes and legal challenges and that they should pay up for equal pay.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4821</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Long Walk for Peace Arrives at the Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Scotland&rsquo;s Long Walk for Peace which arrived at the Parliament on the afternoon of 19 September 2006 and congratulates all the walkers who have walked 85 miles from the Trident nuclear submarine base at Faslane to Edinburgh over the last six days; thanks the 36 MSPs who have signed the on-line petition supporting the walk for peace, and hopes that those MSPs who came out to welcome the marchers will have the courage of their convictions and vote in the Scottish Parliament at the next opportunity to rid Scotland of Trident&rsquo;s nuclear weapons, noting that ordinary voters are disappointed by politicians who patronise them by doing one thing for the cameras of the assembled media but another at voting time.</p>
