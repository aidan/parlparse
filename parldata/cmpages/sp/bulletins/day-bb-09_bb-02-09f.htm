<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>

<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3407</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Supporting Scotland&rsquo;s Future, Research from Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent research report produced by Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges, <em>Supporting Scotland&rsquo;s Future</em>, available at http://www.ascol.org.uk/docs/research_report_web.pdf; further notes Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges&rsquo; proposal in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s review of student support to move all of Scotland&rsquo;s HNC and HND students from loans funded through the Students Awards Agency for Scotland to means-tested bursaries funded in the same way as other college bursaries in order to create a simplified system where students studying higher education courses in colleges receive the support that they need to complete their courses without being obstructed by the burden of debt, which, according to research, college students find to be the biggest barrier to accessing higher education, and calls on the Scottish Government to pay close consideration to the research by Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges and its proposals with a view to supporting students in colleges to be able to access higher education without the burden of huge student debt.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3406</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>No Place for Chauvinism in 21st Century Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls for Dr Louise Richardson, the new principal of St Andrews University, to be offered honorary membership of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews as were her male predecessors; believes that discrimination on the basis of gender has no place in 21st century Scotland; considers that the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews is the home of golf and sets an example for the game to millions of players across the world and millions of visitors to Scotland; believes that the Year of Homecoming 2009 provides an opportunity for the club to drop such an outdated and discriminatory policy, and calls on politicians from across the political spectrum, starting with the First Minister, to support calls for the principal to be offered membership regardless of gender and for the club to drop its policy against allowing women members.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3405</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Welcoming OFT Steps in Sale and Rent Back</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has written to a number of sale and rent back companies asking them to substantiate their advertising claims; believes that the OFT is acting correctly to protect the rights of the most vulnerable homeowners from some unscrupulous companies who buy properties from people struggling to make mortgage repayments, often at well below the market value, and rent back, often at well above the market value and contrary to the original agreements; calls on the UK Government to implement the OFT&rsquo;s recommendations on sale and rent back schemes, in particular the recommendation that such companies should be regulated by the Financial Services Authority, and welcomes all measures by both the Scottish and UK governments to support homeowners experiencing hardship during this recession.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Bill Wilson<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3404</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Professor Sir Philip Cohen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Professor Sir Philip Cohen of the University of Dundee for his recent recognition in the award of Leading Individual Contribution to Life Sciences in the Scottish Enterprise Life Sciences Awards 2009; recognises his vast contribution to the field as the most cited bioscientist in Europe; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s investment of &pound;10 million in the new Scottish Institute for Cell Signalling under his direction, and acknowledges the importance of the life sciences sector to the economy of both Dundee and Scotland as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3403</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Child Poverty and UK Benefits System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of <em>Child Poverty</em>, a report to the Local Government and Communities Committee, and in particular the finding that &quot;for single parents, with young children in particular, in the current labour market and benefits system, moving into the labour market is unlikely to result in people being financially much better off. Even if child care can be provided at an affordable cost (which is very debatable) the way the benefits system works seems likely to mean that, even with tax credits, most will not be much better off&quot;; additionally notes that housing benefit is withdrawn at a rate of 65% and for council tax benefit that the figure is 20%, giving a net claw-back of 85p in the pound for income over the benefit threshold, and considers that the UK Government&rsquo;s plans to impose progression-to-work conditionality and sanctions on parents of young children are therefore misplaced.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3402</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Israeli Disruption of International Aid Effort</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes a recent <em>Al Jazeera </em>report that the Israeli navy intercepted and boarded the ship, Al-Ikhwa, en route from Cyprus to Gaza with medical equipment, food supplies, books and toys and milk for children; is of the opinion that, if true, the alleged beating and detention of the passengers, among whom were Scottish human rights observer Theresa McDermott and nine human rights observers from Lebanon, the vandalism of the ship&rsquo;s equipment, the destruction of plasma and the diversion of the ship to Ashdod allegedly for it to be searched, despite searches already having been carried out by Lebanese and Cypriot authorities, amounts to further criminal action by a government that has demonstrated time and again that it has little regard for human rights or life; also considers that such actions are likely to embitter and entrench opposition rather than further the cause of peace, and calls on Israel to release the ship, appropriately compensate all concerned and recognise that oppression damages the oppressor as well as the victim.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3353</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Sandwick Junior High School Big Energy Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the final of the Big Green Challenge debating competition was held in the Parliament on 30 January 2009, when Sandwick Junior High School, Gairloch High School, Portree High School and Arran High School debated important renewable energy motions; recognises that the hard work all the teams will have put into the competition in researching renewable energy reflects the importance of renewable energy to the Highlands and Islands; congratulates all the teams on their success in reaching the final of this prestigious competition; particularly congratulates Sandwick Junior High School and its team of Joe Christie, Ceidiog Saxelby and Saibh Finlayson for winning the competition, and hopes that they will enjoy their prize, a trip to Iceland, which will include a visit to the Blue Lagoon and to the geothermal area of Geysir.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3351.1</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive Opt-out</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3351) in the name of Liam McArthur, insert at end &quot;notes with surprise that the sole Scottish Liberal Democrat Member of the European Parliament voted to end the UK opt-out as opposed to the SNP, Conservative and, indeed, English Liberal Democrat MEPs who voted to support the Scottish and UK governments&rsquo; shared position for retention of an opt-out; nonetheless welcomes the change of heart on the part of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, which may help to clarify their position to the retained firefighters of Scotland; commends the mature and responsible joint efforts by the Scottish and UK governments to resolve this potentially confused legal situation in a calm and rational manner as opposed to resorting to scaremongering with hypothetical situations; looks forward to a sensible resolution of this dispute, and considers that the actions of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have confused the issue and have been ultimately unhelpful.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3215#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>People with Dementia in Accident and Emergency - Recognising Their Needs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the launch of the report, <em>People with Dementia in NHS Accident and Emergency - Recognising Their Needs</em>, by the Cross Party Group on Alzheimer&rsquo;s; is concerned that evidence suggests that, while an estimated 70% of elderly people attending accident and emergency will show some sign of having mental health problems including dementia, less than 10% of problems are identified by admitting doctors; notes evidence that suggests that the average length of stay for an older person with dementia in accident and emergency is between three and seven hours and that readmission for this vulnerable group is likely to result in high levels of functional decline; further notes that mortality rates for patients with dementia admitted to hospital are higher than for other elderly people with some studies suggesting that as many as 30% of such patients die within six months and more than 10% are readmitted and may be placed in institutional care as a consequence; recognises the report&rsquo;s recommendation that where clinically possible there should be a presumption against admission for patients with dementia and that specialist community-based care, including consultant support and diagnostic testing, is desirable; welcomes as a starting point the decision by NHS Ayrshire and Arran to appoint a mental health liaison nurse to lead the development of protocols, policies and guidelines relevant to patients with dementia, and believes that it is important that people with dementia are given appropriate and timely treatment that respects their dignity and independence.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3095#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Scottish Coastal Path</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the development of core path networks, which it believes can make a major contribution to both encouraging healthy exercise and attracting tourists to Scotland, and particularly welcomes those in the South of Scotland; considers that coastal paths have a particular attractiveness because of the beauty of Scotland&rsquo;s coastline; further considers that long-distance paths have a particular role to play in attracting walkers to undertake at least part of the journey along such paths; congratulates those councils that have already created and marked paths along all or part of their coastlines, and believes that the creation of a Scottish coastal path, marked and marketed as such, would be a worthwhile long-term objective and would provide a national asset.</p>
