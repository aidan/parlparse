          <p> <strong>*S1M-2546.1</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Sea Fisheries</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S1M-2546) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert 
            at end &quot;; further calls on the Executive to seek an increase 
            in nephrops quotas in line with scientific advice and ensure that 
            the outcome of all the negotiations recognises the mixed character 
            of Scotland&#146;s fisheries and takes into account the many conservation 
            measures already agreed by the industry; further calls upon Ministers 
            to retain an open mind with regard to fisheries management measures 
            proposed by the industry and financially supported by the EU, and 
            urges the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to seek designation 
            as lead UK Minister on the EU Fisheries Council for the forthcoming 
            negotiations on quotas and the Common Fisheries Policy in order to 
            secure the best possible deal for the catching and processing sectors.

            overturn the proposed cuts in nephrops quotas in favour of figures 
            based on scientific advice; calls for a significant cut in industrial 
            fishing; notes that the change in net mesh sizes will put an unfair 
            burden on Scottish fishermen who fish both EU and Norwegian waters, 
            and further calls on the Executive to press for retention of the internationally 
            accepted 20-microgramme testing system for scallops to promote the 
            survival of the Scottish scallop industry.</p>

            the partnership between management and staff to improve industrial 
            relations through the voluntary industrial relations agreement; welcomes 
            the prison service&#146;s commitment to collaborating on an increasingly 
            transparent basis with statutory and voluntary agencies to provide 
            effective rehabilitation and through care, aimed at reducing re-offending; 
            notes that investment has been made in upgrading the prison estate, 
            but that more must be done; to that end, welcomes the Executive&#146;s 
            open approach in planning to consult on the Prison Estates Review 
            early in the new year, and agrees that work to upgrade the estate 
            must deliver prisons capable of providing sufficient humane and secure 
            accommodation while delivering value for money.&quot; </p>
