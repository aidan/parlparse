<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4699</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Hon. George Fowlds, from Fenwick to the New Zealand Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 17 August 2009 is the 75th anniversary of the death of the Hon. George Fowlds, a member of the New Zealand Parliament from 1899 to 1911, serving as Minister of Education and Public Health from 1906 to 1911; further notes that Mr Fowlds emigrated from Fenwick, Ayrshire in 1882 and that his father, the weaver, Matthew Fowlds, lived on in Fenwick and reached his centenary year in 1906; records that Mr Fowlds returned for the centenary celebration, accompanied by Sir Joseph Ward, then serving as Prime Minister of New Zealand; notes also that a commemorative service will be held in Fenwick on the anniversary, organised by the modern day Fenwick Weavers&rsquo; Society, for which messages of appreciation have been received from the Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Hon. John Key, and the Mayor of Auckland City, the Hon. John Banks QSO.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4698</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Britain&rsquo;s Oldest Man</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the passing of Robert Taggart, Scotland and Britain&rsquo;s oldest man, and pays tribute to his long life and experiences; sends its condolences to his daughters and wider family; notes that he was born and bred and lived his life in the Royal Burgh of Rutherglen, itself fittingly Scotland&rsquo;s oldest Royal Burgh; recalls his long association and achievements over 70 years with Overtoun Park Bowling Club, formerly Rutherglen Public Bowling Club, latterly as a life member, and mourns the passing of a generation who gave so much to Scotland and Britain.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4697</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to North Kelvin United on its 10th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved with the North Glasgow Football Development Group and North Kelvin United, whose senior team celebrates its 10th anniversary this year; pays tribute to players and coaching staff alike; acknowledges the wide community benefit that the club provides to its various youth and senior teams, and considers that a number of players have shown considerable effort, reliability, loyalty and service to the club over those years, not least the six senior squad players, David Kelly, Mark S Adams, Craig Gilfillan, Chris Campbell, Scott McKinnon and Alex Kay, who have played for each of the first 10 seasons, clocking up almost 1,300 appearances among them with four of them also reaching a landmark 200 appearances.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4696&diams; </strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Concerns over Children&rsquo;s Beauty Salon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the opening in Glasgow of Scotland&rsquo;s first beauty salon targeted at children, Tantrums and Tiaras, which caters for tots to 16-year-olds, offering pamper parties accompanied with glasses of alcohol-free bubbly served up in champagne glasses; believes that the further erosion of childhood innocence and the continuing sexualisation of children pressurises children into acting and behaving in ways that are detrimental to their natural healthy development, leading to possible problems in the future such as emotional distress, anxiety, low self-esteem, eating disorders and depression; notes the findings of The Good Childhood Inquiry, which was commissioned by The Children&rsquo;s Society with the aim of renewing society&rsquo;s understanding of modern childhood and which, alongside its other recommendations, believes that the premature sexualisation of children should be discouraged, and hopes that this inquiry and other work done in this field will help inform and shape policy toward providing children with the best possible childhood.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4695</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Revive MS Support - 25 Years of Service</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the workers, volunteers and users of Revive MS Support as they celebrate 25 years of service to those affected by Multiple Sclerosis; notes that every year over 2,500 people benefit from the therapies, information and support provided by the charity; recognises the strong emphasis on partnership working which is at the heart of the organisation, and commends all those involved in both the centre in Maryhill and at the outreach clinics operated across Scotland.</p>
