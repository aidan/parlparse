<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7010 Hugh Henry: Parking Charges at the Royal Alexandria Hospital, Paisley</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes what it considers to be the chaos and the major inconvenience to staff and residents that has been caused by changes to the parking arrangements at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; further regrets what it believes to be the failure of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Renfrewshire Council to communicate with local residents and to produce a joint plan regarding the changes to help staff and residents, and calls on the NHS board and the local authority to identify urgently a solution that will be beneficial to staff and residents.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7009 Bill Kidd: Drastic Impact of Coalition&rsquo;s Welfare Cuts on Glasgow City</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the findings of the report, <em>People Councils the Economy, An assessment of the impact of proposed changes to the UK Benefits System</em> by the Scottish Local Government Forum Against Poverty, and Rights Advice Scotland, that: &quot;Scotland&rsquo;s poorest individuals, families and communities will pay a heavy price for successive UK Governments&rsquo; decisions to prop-up the collapsing banking and financial services sector and reduce the resultant national deficit by cutting public expenditure, benefits and reforming the welfare system&quot;, and in particular notes that Glasgow City will lose around &pound;4 million in Housing Benefit, &pound;43 million in Disability Living Allowance and up to &pound;43 million in Incapacity Benefit, which along with other cuts, could cost Glasgow around &pound;100 million annually.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Wilson<strong>*</strong>, Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong>, Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong>, Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7008 John Swinney: The Councillors&rsquo; Code of Conduct &ndash; Revised Code of Conduct for Councillors &amp; the Executive Note for the The Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Communities Committee recommends that the Councillors&rsquo; Code of Conduct &ndash; Revised Code of Conduct for Councillors &amp; the Executive Note for the The Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7007 Jim Hume: Congratulations to the Park Family of Drinkstone on Winning the Future Farmer Award 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Arnold Park of Drinkstone, near Hawick, his son, John, and his family on winning the Future Farmer Award 2010; notes that the judges recognised the Parks&rsquo; strong environmental ethos and high quality grassland management, and further acknowledges their success in gaining the highest recorded gigot score with their ram, Drinkstone Punt Fun.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7006 Kenneth Gibson: CrossReach Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges and commends the 2,000 committed staff working for CrossReach across Scotland; notes what it considers their determination and dedication to improving the lives of those most in need on a daily basis; understands that 3,000 people are offered unconditional support and assistance every day through the services offered by CrossReach, which include children&rsquo;s services, counselling and support, criminal justice, homeless people, learning disabilities, mental health, older people and substance misuse; is aware that over 67% of CrossReach staff are now appropriately qualified and that 171 have gained qualifications in the last year; recognises that 94% of services were graded good to excellent for quality of care and support and that two staff were finalists in the Scottish Care awards, and appreciates that Adams House in Elderslie was a finalist at the Great British Care Homes Awards and that the Oasis Centre at Garelochhead received a bronze COSLA Excellence award.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7005 Kenneth Gibson: Impact of Changes to the UK Benefit System</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the publication of a recent report by the Scottish Local Government Forum Against Poverty regarding the impact on people, local authorities and the economy of the proposed changes to the UK benefits system; is alarmed that official government sources show that Scotland stands to lose up to &pound;614 million from its economy over the next few years, which could result in the loss of as many as 14,220 jobs; considers that such job losses would place an enormous strain on local authorities as the demand for social work, housing and advice services increases at a time when they are expected to cut current spending levels by up to 25%; is deeply concerned that, in an effort to meet the demand for the aforementioned services, other valuable services such as education, leisure and cleaning will inevitably suffer; further considers that the impending changes will place a huge financial strain on some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society at a time when unemployment is high, higher education places are scarce and living costs are rising as a result of higher than anticipated inflation and the forthcoming VAT increase; is perturbed by the scale and severity of proposed benefit cuts, which are likely to see Scots lose a total of over &pound;27 million in Local Housing Allowance, &pound;260 million in Disability Living Allowance and &pound;235 million in Incapacity Benefit over four years, &pound;48 million in Child Benefit annually, while over-65-year-olds face losing a total of &pound;28 million per year in Attendance Allowance; believes, in light of the economic climate, that the UK Government should look more closely at the implications of such drastic cuts and should instead seek to grow the economy by furnishing the Scottish Parliament with full fiscal autonomy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7004 Kenneth Gibson: Dance Scottish Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament celebrates Dance Scottish Week, from 17 to 25 September 2010, along with countries spanning the globe; commends the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society, established in 1923 with 170 branches across the world, for what it considers its tremendous work in promoting and developing Scottish country dancing worldwide for fun, fitness and friendship; acclaims the society for continuing to preserve a dance tradition with the aim of ensuring that country dancing remains at the heart of Scotland&rsquo;s heritage for generations to come, and notes the success of the Kandahar Reel developed by serving Black Watch soldiers in Afghanistan, which it considers was danced to perfection in the Scottish Parliament on 14 September.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7003 Kenneth Gibson: NHS Ayrshire and Arran Street Nurse Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates NHS Ayrshire and Arran on its Street Nurse initiative, developed as part of the Healthy North Ayrshire programme;  applauds this initiative for its work on improving health awareness by allowing the people of North Ayrshire to share their concerns with a Street Nurse who is able to give health information and advice on the spot and can also provide onward referral to community services if appropriate; recognises the value of what it considers this innovative approach to community engagement and health improvement, which deploys the Healthy North Ayrshire nursing team to work in local regeneration communities and directly with groups that are known to experience poorer health and wellbeing to carry out rapid lifestyle assessments, and is supportive of this scheme and its delivery of key health information to those who may be at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7002 Ken Macintosh: Lack of Support</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Government to reconcile the First Minister&rsquo;s programme for government, in which he talked of continuing to support the armed forces and veterans&rsquo; community, with the actions of SNP backbencher Christine Grahame MSP; considers that Ms Grahame displayed insensitivity and unfairness in trying to use the example of a visit by a Royal Navy officer and parent in East Renfrewshire to his local nursery as an example of the armed forces allegedly recruiting three and four-year-olds; further asks ministers to explain how this behaviour displays support for the armed services, and calls on Ms Grahame to apologise to the officer concerned and to the people of Neilston for the offence that it considers that she has caused.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7001 Liam McArthur: Orkney Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the recent study by Save the Children into the gap in the educational success between children from low-income homes and their peers found that Orkney had the second lowest gap in Scotland, with its 20% under a third of the Scottish average; considers that, while this still leaves a gap to be closed, the lower figure reflects the successful way that Orkney&rsquo;s education service tackles the challenge of overcoming the disadvantages that pupils from low-income homes all too often suffer - through quality pupil support, engagement and support of parents and committed teaching that involves and inspires children; believes that that is one of the reasons that 94% of Orkney pupils go on to positive destinations such as higher and further education, vocational training or work and is one of the best rates in Scotland, and considers that, while Save the Children is to be commended for highlighting this issue, its recycling of a generic headline when regionalising its press campaign, so that it claims that Orkney has a &quot;scandalous&quot; education gap, undermines the credibility of its work and is yet another unfortunate example of central belt-based bodies taking a one-size-fits-all approach, an approach that all too often discriminates against Scotland&rsquo;s islands.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7000 Pauline McNeill: Congratulations to the xx</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the xx on winning the Mercury Prize; notes that its album was described as a record of its time by head judge Simon Firth; recognises the band&rsquo;s success since its creation in 2005; wishes the band continued success in the future, and notes the importance of the Mercury Prize to the music industry and in promoting new artists.</p>
