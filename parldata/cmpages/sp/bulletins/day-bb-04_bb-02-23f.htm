          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-927</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>GM Crops</strong>-That the Parliament expresses concern at the apparent decision by the UK Government to approve the commercial cultivation of GM crops and therefore ignore the results of its own GM Nation debate; considers that the farm scale trials were too narrow in their scope to provide robust evidence of environmental safety and that no scientific evidence exists that proves that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) pose no danger to human health; calls on the Scottish Executive to use its existing power to refuse permission for the growing of GM crops until GM technology has been proved as safe for both human health and the environment, and believes that liability for any environmental, economic or health consequences of the intentional or unintentional release of GMOs in Scotland must fall on the biotech companies that produce them.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-926</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Primary Medical Care in Lanarkshire</strong>-That the Parliament notes the consultation being undertaken by NHS Lanarkshire in relation to primary medical services; is concerned that only one third of GPs have indicated a willingness to participate in new out-of-hours services and that only five GPs are proposed to cover home visits overnight for the entire NHS Lanarkshire area; notes that only housebound and terminally ill patients will be guaranteed a home visit, leaving vulnerable children and other adults with no choice but to make long journeys during the night to access any care; believes that total waiting times for that care, including transport, will be unacceptably long; further believes that, in the context of increasing out-of-hours patient contacts with primary medical services, the proposed provision is woefully inadequate and will not meet the needs of Lanarkshire people, and is concerned that the practical impact of the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 and the new GP contract in Lanarkshire is not untypical and that patient care in Scotland will suffer as a result of its introduction unless there is a substantial increase in the number of GP hours available for out-of-hours provision and a commitment to maintain locally based provision.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-925</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Johnstone Hospital</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Save Johnstone Hospital Campaign that succeeded in reversing Argyll and Clyde NHS Board's decision to close the hospital, which provides care beds for elderly people; notes that this victory means that patients will not be moved, providing reassurance to current patients, one of whom is 101 years of age; further notes that many members of the campaign have elderly relatives who are patients in the hospital and that, after launching a petition, taking to the streets and lobbying the NHS board, they succeeded in keeping the hospital open, and agrees that this was a victory for grass roots campaigning.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-924</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Hull City Council</strong>-That the Parliament applauds the decision of Hull's Labour controlled city council to introduce free healthy school meals, breakfasts and tea-time snacks for 22,300 primary schoolchildren in Hull in a move intended to improve child health and poverty; notes that council leader Councillor Colin Inglis declared that &quot;we hope to set the pace for the whole country&quot;; agrees wholeheartedly with this move, and calls on the Scottish Parliament to follow suit and introduce free school meals throughout Scotland.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-923</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Council House Rent Rises in Stirling</strong>-That the Parliament notes the decision of Stirling Council to increase council house rents by 8% this year, in sharp contrast with the relatively low level introduced immediately before the last year's local authority elections and further notes with surprise the lack of any public criticism of this large rent rise from Stirling Labour Councillor Colin Findlay, despite the fact that only last month he felt compelled to publicly lecture power companies for a 6% increase in bills which he said would have a &quot;devastating impact on families&quot;.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-922</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Strategic Waste Funding to the City of Edinburgh Council</strong>-That the Parliament warmly welcomes the Strategic Waste Fund allocation of &pound;83 million to the City of Edinburgh Council; commends the council's plans to exceed the national target of 25% recycling and composting in Edinburgh by 2006-07; further welcomes the introduction of a city centre cardboard collection scheme and the extension of kerbside collection of garden waste, paper, glass, aluminium and steel cans to over 100,000 homes in Edinburgh; congratulates the council for its aim to increase recycling facilities for residents of the capital city, and acknowledges that new and enhanced recycling facilities will help to deliver an additional 1 million tonnes of recycled materials by 2020.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-921</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Asthma in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes with great concern the recently published research by the Global Initiative for Asthma indicating that Scotland has the world's highest incidence of asthma in children; further notes that National Asthma Campaign Scotland estimates that the condition costs Scotland &pound;194.9 million per year and that 3.5 million asthma sufferers in the UK say that traffic pollution aggravates their condition; further notes the lack of definitive research establishing the causes of asthma and that tackling the issue has focussed on treatment of symptoms rather than addressing root causes, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to invest in further research in order to establish why Scotland suffers such high rates of asthma and how the causes of this can be addressed.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>, Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong>, Mr Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Tricia Marwick<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-920#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Community Right to Oppose Supermarket Developments</strong>-That the Parliament notes the report by the New Economics Foundation, <em>Ghost Town Britain,</em> which demonstrates the negative impact that supermarkets can have on communities and local economies; considers that a good example of the problems with superstores is the situation in Portobello where residents calculate that 41 retail outlets have closed, have become charity shops, have been converted to dwellings or have been demolished and where remaining shops are struggling and the community is faced with an application from a developer for planning permission to erect a superstore in the High Street despite the presence of one superstore in the town and a further eight within a two mile radius; believes that the Scottish Executive should provide incentives for shopping in locally-owned and run outlets and prioritise such outlets in all legislation relating to planning and urban regeneration, and further believes that a comprehensive network of post offices, rather than incorporating post office functions into superstores, is a key way of supporting local economies.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-919</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Social Work Funding Crisis</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that Aberdeen City Council spends &pound;3.077 million more on community care than it receives in grant aided expenditure (GAE) and also spends &pound;10.145 million more on care of children than it receives in GAE; notes that Aberdeen City Council now ranks 32nd out of 32 local authorities in terms of central government grant per head of population, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide Aberdeen City Council with the funding that it needs and deserves to provide social care for its most at risk citizens.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-918</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Compulsory Registration of Private Landlords</strong>-That the Parliament believes that a system of compulsory registration of private landlords with local authorities should be incorporated into the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill.</P>
