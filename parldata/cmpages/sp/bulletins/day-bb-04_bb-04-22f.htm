          <p><strong>*S2M-1189</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Dunfermline Athletic Football Club</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates Dunfermline Athletic Football Club on reaching the 2004 
            Tennent's Scottish Cup Final; acknowledges that this will be the Pars' 
            first such final since last winning the cup in 1968; notes that the 
            club has qualified for European football for the first time since 
            1970, and wishes all four of Scotland's representatives in next season's 
            European football competitions every success.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1188</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Future 
            of Clyde Boat Building and Marine Facilities</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the historic boat and ship building tradition on the Clyde and 
            the need for comprehensive development of the waterfront that will 
            fully respect and cater for the river's marine heritage and regrets 
            the loss of any existing boat and marine businesses to residential 
            development, such as through the proposals being pursued by Clydeport 
            to develop the area surrounding the Renfrew Ferry including the Clyde 
            River Boat Yard and the &quot;Old Garvel Yard&quot;.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1187#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Promoting 
            Timber Buildings</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Caithness 
            area of Highland Council for promoting the successful seminar &quot;Tomorrow's 
            Houses Today&quot; that explored the possibilities for creating energy-efficient, 
            eco-friendly housing using local materials; notes the participants' 
            conclusions that local timber should be a key component in construction 
            as it offers Scotland the use of a plentiful, renewable resource; 
            further notes the opportunities to create new house styles fit for 
            localised climatic and landscape characteristics, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should quickly respond by reforming planning 
            laws and building regulations to encourage diverse architectural expression 
            through the medium of timber construction for affordable and sustainable 
            homes and public buildings.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1186</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Death 
            of Ronnie Simpson</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its sadness 
            at the sudden passing of Ronnie Simpson; recognises his contribution 
            to national and international football and to goalkeeping from the 
            beginning of his career at Queen's Park Football Club at the age of 
            14, as well as periods at Third Lanark Football Club, Hibernian Football 
            Club and Newcastle United Football Club where he won two FA cup winners' 
            medals, his caps for Scotland and, in particular, his role as the 
            last line of defence in Celtic Football Club's greatest-ever victory 
            when they won the European Cup in 1967, and extends its condolences 
            to his family and friends, including his fellow Lisbon Lions.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1185.1</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> 
            <strong>Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency</strong>-As an amendment 
            to motion (S2M-1185) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from 
            &quot;endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the contribution 
            that both renewable energy and energy efficiency make to tackling 
            carbon emissions; further recognises the importance of tackling climate 
            change; agrees, therefore, to raise the Scottish Executive's targets 
            for generating increasing amounts of electricity from renewable resources 
            to 25% of electricity generation capacity by 2010, 30% by 2015 and 
            50% by 2020; regrets that energy policy is largely reserved to Westminster 
            and rejects calls for an expansion of the nuclear contribution to 
            Scotland's electricity production; acknowledges the important contribution 
            that can be made by small-scale, domestic and community-based renewable 
            energy projects; notes the recent growth in applications for wind 
            farm developments and regrets the absence of clear, concise and coherent 
            guidelines for the approval of such developments; acknowledges the 
            long-term potential for the development of renewable energy technologies, 
            including the associated economic benefits and rural regeneration 
            and export opportunities, and urges the Executive to ensure that these 
            technologies are supported beyond the research and development stage 
            to ensure that Scotland can become a world leader in renewable energy 
            technologies.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1185.2</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Renewable 
            Energy and Energy Efficiency</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1185) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;notes the increasing scepticism about the 
            achievability of the Scottish Executive's targets for renewable energy 
            from a number of sources, including former Energy Minister Brian Wilson 
            MP and UNISON; further notes the publication of reports from the Royal 
            Academy of Engineers and Professor David Simpson of the David Hume 
            Institute on the costs of wind power generation as against other generation 
            methods; regrets the current rush to develop onshore wind capacity 
            to the exclusion of other technologies such as hydro, wave, tidal 
            and biomass, and calls on the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's 
            Government to work together to develop an energy strategy for Scotland 
            which will include a mix of generating capacity, with components from 
            renewables, gas, coal and nuclear power.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1185.3</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Renewable 
            Energy and Energy Efficiency</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1185) 
            in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &quot;endorses&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Executive can play 
            a much more significant role in tackling climate change by encouraging 
            reductions in energy use through greater energy efficiency and by 
            achieving a greater shift in energy use from fossil fuels to renewable 
            sources, whilst at the same time creating sustainable &quot;green&quot; 
            jobs; welcomes the targets set by the Executive for generation of 
            40% of electricity from renewable sources but notes that this amounts 
            to only about 8% of Scotland's total energy use; recognises that a 
            study commissioned by the Executive shows that the energy potential 
            from renewable energy in Scotland is as much as 60 gigawatts and therefore 
            that renewable energy has a massive potential to supply energy, not 
            only for electricity but also for fuels; further recognises that Scotland 
            leads the world in research and development of wave energy converters; 
            is gravely concerned that the first order for wave converters has 
            come from outside Scotland and that the potential for a manufacturing 
            industry for wave converters may be lost to Scotland because of insufficient 
            market incentives, and therefore calls on the Executive to set concrete 
            targets for energy efficiency, to publish an action plan, including 
            targets, for renewable energy to supply non-electrical uses and to 
            improve market-based incentives for emerging renewable energy technologies.&quot;</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1184.1</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> 
            <strong>Mental Health</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1184) 
            in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;while expressing 
            concern that the large number of vacant consultant psychiatrists' 
            posts represents a significant barrier to delivering much sought after 
            improvements.&quot;</P>
          <p>Supported by: Shona Robison<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1184.2</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> 
            <strong>Mental Health</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1184) 
            in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;welcomes National Depression Week and its 
            aims to raise awareness, reduce the stigma and make more effective 
            the treatment of depression; notes the work of the Scottish Executive 
            to implement the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 
            2003 but also notes the conclusions of the National Mental Health 
            Services Assessment which highlights shortcomings in mental health 
            services; is concerned about recruitment, retention and support issues 
            surrounding the mental health workforce; notes that the number of 
            those receiving care in inappropriate settings is still too high, 
            and urges the Executive to increase its efforts to address the rising 
            incidence of suicide in Scotland.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1184.3</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Mental 
            Health</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1184) in the name of 
            Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;through&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;; notes that mental health problems disproportionately affect 
            those living in deprived areas and that despite the Executive's commitment 
            to tackling mental health problems as a priority, mental health services 
            remain underfunded and overstretched in many parts of Scotland; believes 
            that abolishing prescription charges would help to address the poverty 
            trap faced by mental health service users who return to work, and 
            further believes that more resources should be directed towards treatment 
            and rehabilitation in community settings, that there should be a greater 
            emphasis on children's mental health, that in-patient treatment facilities 
            should be housed in modern buildings, accessible to the communities 
            that they serve, that more practical and financial support should 
            be given to the families and other carers of those experiencing mental 
            health problems and that, as a priority, a well-resourced, independent 
            national advocacy service for users of mental health services should 
            be established in Scotland.&quot;</P>
