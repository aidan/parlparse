    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-447</b> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Commissioner for Children and Young
    People</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls for the establishment of the post of
    Commissioner for Children and Young People to act as an impartial advocate of
    children&#146;s rights, to ensure the implementation and systematic monitoring of the
    United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to consider legislation and
    policy from the perspective of children and young people.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Fiona McLeod<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-446</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Precious Life</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    condemns the intimidating and undemocratic activities of the anti-abortion campaign,
    Precious Life; and defends the right of women in Scotland to attend family planning
    clinics and pregnancy advice centres free from harassment.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-445</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Circuses</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    expresses its concern that, despite the revelation in 1999 in an English court that
    training of animals to perform circus acts can involve severe cruelty, animals continue to
    be used in circuses; notes that even the best circuses offer animals a very basic and
    extremely restricted existence, with elephants chained for 23 hours a day, with big cats
    and domestic dogs kept in small cages, and horses and other animals tethered in cramped
    stalls, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to take action to end the practise of using
    animals in circus acts in Scotland.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-444</b> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson: Committee on Substance Abuse</strong>&#151;That

    when Scottish residents who qualify use the railway station at Berwick upon Tweed during
    their journey.</p>
