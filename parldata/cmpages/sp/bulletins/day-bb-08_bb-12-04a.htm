<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Broadcasting&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3013</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Broadcasting</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 4 December 2008 is the final date for submissions to Ofcom&rsquo;s Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) Review, Preparing for the Digital Future; recognises that, while broadcasting is reserved, there is a need for a healthy, competitive Scottish-based television programme-making sector outwith the BBC, notwithstanding that organisation&rsquo;s historic, respected and pivotal role in Scottish broadcasting; recognises the role of STV as the only remaining Scottish-based commercial PSB provider; prefers Ofcom&rsquo;s enhanced evolution option with a commercial TV channel continuing to provide PSB for Scotland as part of a wider UK network; recognises that STV&rsquo;s survival as a PSB provider is at risk in the current economic climate, particularly since ITV is now advocating a single UK-wide brand, and calls on Ofcom to explore all options to ensure that there is PSB competition for BBC Scotland in the nation&rsquo;s rapidly changing broadcasting landscape. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-3013.1</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: Broadcasting</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3013) in the name of Ted Brocklebank, insert at end &quot;; further believes that all Scottish residents should have access to the full range of broadcasting following digital switchover, and calls on Ofcom to ensure that all relay transmitters are capable of transmitting the full spectrum of free-to-view broadcasting and that the 7th Mux is enabled in Scotland.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Local Government Finance&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3014</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>Local Government Finance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the intention of the Scottish Government to introduce legislation to reform the system of local government taxation and calls on it to ensure that the scope of the Bill when introduced is sufficiently wide as to enable members to debate and vote on all options, including reform of the council tax, a land value tax, a local income tax with variable rates determined locally and the Scottish Government&rsquo;s own proposals. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-3014.2</strong> <strong>John Swinney: Local Government Finance</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3014) in the name of Derek Brownlee, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the council tax is discredited and should be abolished and that a local income tax based on ability to pay is a fairer system of local taxation, and calls on the Scottish Government to publish early in 2009 its detailed response to the consultation on local income tax for debate by this Parliament.&quot; </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3014.2.1</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Local Government Finance</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-3014.2) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;, giving further consideration to a system of local taxation that includes local variability, protection for those in full-time education, transition support for businesses and appropriate taxation for people receiving high levels of income from dividends.&quot; </p>
