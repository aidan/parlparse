            end of the three year transition period the majority of farmers will 
            see their incomes drastically cut; notes that in some areas the National 
            Farmers’ Union estimates that over 80% of farmers will be worse off 
            under this scheme; recognises the unavoidable extra costs associated 
            with farming in peripheral areas, and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to implement a secure funding package which will ensure the sustainability 
            of beef and sheep farming.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Restoring Prosperity in Cumnock - Doon Valley</strong>—That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the lack of progress made by successive 
            governments in creating access to jobs and prosperity for the people 
            of Cumnock and Doon Valley; believes that the average houshold income 
            in Cumnock and Doon Valley, reported at £16,500 compared to the UK 
            average of £23,200, illustrates the failure of these governments’ 
            economic policies designed as they are to meet the needs of the South 
            East of England; welcomes the recent announcements by the Scottish 
            Executive to increase funding for the fight against poverty and deprivation 
            in Cumnock and Doon Valley by the East Ayrshire Coalfield Area Social 
            Inclusion Partnership and to establish a better Neighbourhood Services 
            Fund for the area; recognises, however, that to transform rather than 
            ameliorate living standards requires substantial public investment 
            in infrastructure and increased support for expansion and development 
            of new and existing businesses in the Ayrshire economy, and urges 
            the Scottish Executive to seek the transfer of currently reserved 
            powers with regard to economic policy so that jobs and prosperity 
            can be restored to areas such as Cumnock and Doon Valley.</font></p>

            in 1952 and further congratulates all those who have assisted Mr Gordon

            an appropriate level of new investment in the industry given that 
            such additional support for our fishing communities in their hour 
            of need will ensure that they continue to make an enormous contribution 
            to Scotland.&quot; </font></p>
