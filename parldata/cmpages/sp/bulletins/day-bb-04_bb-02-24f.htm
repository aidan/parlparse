          <p><strong>*S2M-936</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Justice 
            (Northern Ireland) Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees that an amendment should be made to the Justice (Northern Ireland) 
            Bill to provide for the compulsory transfer of prisoners from Northern 
            Ireland to Scotland and that the amendment should be considered by 
            the UK Parliament.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-935#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Government 
            Overspend</strong>-That the Parliament notes the ongoing concern at 
            the cost of building the new Scottish Parliament going over budget; 
            believes that those costs should be considered in the context of the 
            Ministry of Defence's overspend of £3 billion in the last year alone; 
            notes that this included an overspend of £1.3 billion on the Astute 
            Class submarine; further notes that despite the overspend the Ministry 
            of Defence was incapable of providing its employees with basic equipment 
            necessary for its illegal war on Iraq, and believes that Her Majesty's 
            Government should cancel its top 22 defence projects, saving the UK 
            taxpayer £65 billion.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-934</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Methadone 
            Prescribing</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its condolences 
            to the family of Craig Winstone who tragically died after taking a 
            combination of methadone and valium; notes that during the Fatal Accident 
            Inquiry the general practitioner concerned stated that she prescribed 
            methadone to Craig without carrying out a urine test; is concerned 
            that methadone prescribing practice varies widely across Scotland 
            with no consistent approach between different NHS boards; calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to help those working with patients with drug 
            problems by ensuring that there are strong national guidelines in 
            place for the prescribing of methadone, and further calls on the Executive 
            to enforce minimum standards based on best practice across Scotland 
            in order to avoid the possibility of differing standards resulting 
            in avoidable deaths.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-933</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>MMR 
            Vaccine</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the research by Dr 
            Andrew Wakefield linking the MMR vaccine to autism has been discredited 
            by what the editor of <em>The Lancet</em> describes as a &quot;fatal 
            conflict of interest&quot;; regrets that this flawed research led 
            to many parents refusing to vaccinate their children; notes, however, 
            that this impact was compounded by the irresponsible use of the study's 
            findings by certain politicians, and invites those politicians who 
            seek to use questionable medical research to create public disquiet 
            or further a political agenda to reflect on their actions.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-932#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Paul 
            Robeson US Commemorative Stamp</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the US Postal Service's decision to issue a stamp in commemoration 
            of the life of the singer, athlete and political activist Paul Robeson 
            and believes that this is a fitting tribute to a man who made an enormous 
            contribution to the cultural life of the United States of America 
            and Britain throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and yet paid a heavy 
            price as a victim of the McCarthyite witch-hunt that was rife in the 
            USA in the 1950s.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-931#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Fountainbridge 
            Brewery Closure</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the decision 
            of Scottish and Newcastle Breweries to close their Fountainbridge 
            facility; believes that the decision has less to do with the current 
            state of the United Kingdom beer market and more to do with cashing 
            in on the Edinburgh property boom; notes the assurances the company 
            gave the workforce only recently that their jobs were safe when it 
            asked for, and received, &quot;greater employee flexibility&quot; 
            and opened a £10 million state of the art kegging operation, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should give its full support to the campaign 
            to save the facility's 170 jobs.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-930</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Consumer 
            Credit Licensing</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern an 
            article in the <em>Mail on Sunday</em> on 22 February 2004 reporting 
            that a journalist, using his bona fide personal details, was granted 
            a consumer credit licence permitting him, inter alia, to offer loans, 
            offer debt counselling and arrange consolidated debt schemes after 
            the most minimal inquiry by a trading standards officer, namely a 
            brief telephone call confirming these personal details; notes that 
            neither the trading standards officer nor the application form for 
            the licence made any inquiry as to the applicant's current employment 
            status or experience in the field; notes the Department of Trade and 
            Industry's White Paper <em>Fair, Clear and Competitive - The Consumer 
            Credit Market in the 21st Century</em> issued in December 2003 and, 
            in particular, the section on the licensing regime on page 44 and 
            the proposed reforms; notes that, under devolution, the fall-out from 
            personal debt, for example bankruptcies, relationship breakdown and 
            ill-health, all has its cost to the Scottish budget, and therefore 
            urges the Scottish Executive to make representations in the strongest 
            terms to ensure that the loopholes so apparent in the reported example 
            cannot be repeated and further to make urgent representations that, 
            pending a change in the law, procedures are tightened.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-929</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Local Sports Clubs and Activities</strong>-That the Parliament 
            urges <strong>sport</strong>scotland, the Scottish Executive and local 
            authorities to work together to develop a decentralised structure 
            that will support and encourage the development of the approximately 
            13,000 sports clubs, especially in promoting more sport for young 
            people and the sporting activities of other organisations, using the 
            existing network of local sports councils.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-928</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Developing 
            Football in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament urges the Scottish 
            Football Association and all the other organisations involved in managing 
            or promoting football in Scotland for all ages and both sexes to work 
            together to develop a more coherent and effective structure for developing 
            football in Scotland.</P>
