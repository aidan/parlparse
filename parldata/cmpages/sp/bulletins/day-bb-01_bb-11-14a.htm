              have often suffered the loss of a family member because of HCM; 
              further notes the Cardiomyopathy Association's campaign to secure 
              screening by electrocardiogram and echo ultrasound of all first 
              degree relatives of those who die as a result of this condition, 
              and believes that the Scottish Executive, in partnership with the 
              Health and Community Care Committee, the National Health Service 
              and relevant groups working in this field, should consider how best 
              those suffering from this condition might be identified and given 
              access to the appropriate treatment. </p>
