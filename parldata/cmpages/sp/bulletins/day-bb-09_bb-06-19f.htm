<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4451&diams; </strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>ECHR Ruling on Domestic Abuse</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the continuing scourge of domestic abuse in Glasgow and across Scotland; welcomes the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against Turkey for failing to prevent the murder of a woman in the city of Ankara whose daughter had informed police that she believed her mother to be at risk; recognises the significance of this first ruling by the ECHR against a state for failing to protect a woman from domestic violence, and considers that it sends an important signal to all agencies in Glasgow and across Scotland involved in delivering services to those at risk of domestic violence in relation to the need to respond by taking prompt and effective action when they receive reports from victims or potential victims who believe themselves to be at risk of domestic violence.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4450</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Praise the Progress of James Watt College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament praises James Watt College for its excellent progress, which was shown in a report by HM Inspectorate of Education in which the college was praised for preparing learners for progression to employment or further study, for its redesigned curriculum and for measures to improve retention and attainment.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4448</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>2009 Social Enterprise Schools Celebration Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates schools in East Dunbartonshire for winning 10 of the 15 awards at the 2009 Social Enterprise Schools Celebration Day that took place in the Centre for Contemporary Arts, Glasgow, on 9 June 2009; notes that Craighead Primary School, Douglas Academy, Hillhead Primary School, Holy Family Primary School, Killermont Primary School, Merkland School, Milngavie Primary School, St Flannan&rsquo;s Primary School, St Ninian&rsquo;s High School and Turnbull High School all won awards for undertaking the task of setting up and running a successful social enterprise; acknowledges the effort and commitment of all pupils and teachers involved in the projects, and looks forward to seeing the schools create further successful social enterprise projects in the future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Sandra White<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4447</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Calman Commission - A Wasted Opportunity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disappointed with the rather timid recommendations set forth in the publication, <em>Serving Scotland Better: Scotland and the United Kingdom in the 21st Century</em>; believes that proposals merely to redraw Scotland&rsquo;s complex relationship with Westminster would only perpetuate a complex constitutional mess; regrets that the outcome of this report seemed largely predetermined by an unrepresentative unionist clique as evidenced by the convenient sidestepping of full fiscal autonomy and veto powers, the paucity of public meetings and the commission&rsquo;s own stated objective of securing the union; recognises the National Conversation to be much more democratic in its deliberations, considering as it does all constitutional options; sees the Isle of Man and other crown dependencies flourishing through self-governance and wonders why Scotland is not recommended the same privilege; notes that these crown dependencies have long successfully governed in many areas that the commission appears to believe Scotland incapable of managing, such as varying the tax regime, setting energy policy, regulating health professionals, running the postal system and meeting our unique immigration needs; recognises that the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey and the other Channel Islands, with a population of less than 200,000 between them, are entirely self-supporting, receive no subsidies from the United Kingdom and even make an annual contribution to Westminster for defence services; welcomes any increased powers but is disappointed that Scotland will still be denied its own oil revenues and considers limited borrowing to be a far cry from a long-term solution; agrees with those economists who state that the Calman recommendations are at best an opportunity missed and at worst a recipe for economic instability; acknowledges the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government best suited to their needs, as stated in the Scotland Act 1998, and therefore seeks the public&rsquo;s view on this non-consensus document through referendum; suggests that there is no reason why the Scottish people should not decide how they should be governed; believes that these issues could simply be resolved by full Scottish independence, as any other system would restrict Scotland&rsquo;s potential as an enterprising nation, and looks to take Scotland forward following a positive result in the free and fair referendum that the Scottish Government proposes to hold in 2010.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4446</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Universities Green League 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the <em>Times Higher Education</em> published the People and Planet Green League on 18 June 2009; congratulates the University of Edinburgh in coming top of the league in Scotland and gaining a first, with the University of Glasgow being the second greenest in Scotland; commends the students and staff involved in ensuring that universities reduce their negative environmental impacts, and calls on all of Scotland&rsquo;s universities to continue looking for imaginative ways to cut their carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4445</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Ezra Nawi and Israel&rsquo;s Continued Violation of Human Rights</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the actions of Jewish Israeli Ezra Nawi in raising awareness, by persistent non-violent action, of his country&rsquo;s continued de facto ethnic cleansing through the destruction of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank; deplores the continued violation of the human rights of Palestinians by Israeli settlers and the Israeli Defence Force (IDF), which it considers to be in breach of both Israeli and international law; notes reports that the chief of the investigations in the Hebron Israeli Police has admitted that Ezra Nawi&rsquo;s actions are &quot;exposing the dirt laying under the rug&quot;; agrees with Ezra Nawi&rsquo;s remarks, on the destruction of a Palestinian home by the IDF, that &quot;the only thing that will be left here is hatred&quot;, and calls on Israel not to jail or harass him, but to take its moral lead from his courageous and principled stand.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4443</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Trident, Jobs and Scotland&rsquo;s Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication by the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament of a new report on the possible impact of any decision by the UK Government to renew the Trident nuclear weapons system; is concerned by the report&rsquo;s finding that 3,000 public sector jobs in Scotland could be at risk if finance for the project is diverted from existing public expenditure as proposed by the <em>Defence White Paper of 2006</em>; further notes that the report finds that the cost of Trident is over &pound;2 billion per annum and that, &quot;instead of a stimulus to the economy during a time of recession&quot;, the replacement programme represents &quot;a long term spending commitment at a time when the government is trying to balance the books and pay back some of our inflated National Debt&quot;; believes that the report comprehensively rebuts claims that cancellation of Trident would result in the loss of 10,000 jobs in Scotland; supports the continuing work of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Scotland Without Nuclear Weapons Working Group, and calls on the UK Government to scrap Trident and genuinely commit to working for a world free of nuclear weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4441</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>A Gathering Storm</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report, <em>A Gathering Storm? Procurement, re-tendering and the voluntary sector social care workforce</em>, which assesses the impact of retendering on the voluntary sector; is concerned by the findings of the report that the process of retendering is negatively impacting on employment conditions and staff morale, leading to cooperative relations between providers breaking down and wasting valuable resources; congratulates the Voluntary Sector Social Services Workforce Unit, which commissioned the report, and the University of Strathclyde&rsquo;s Dr Ian Cunningham and Professor Dennis Nickson for undertaking the research, and calls on the Scottish Government to issue stronger guidance on the process of retendering, including further consideration of whether it is required in the first place.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4440</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Youthbuild Projects</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the excellent success of Youthbuild in Scotland; further recognises the impact that Youthbuild has brought to local communities, both in terms of the projects built and the benefits that individuals involved receive through skilled training; acknowledges that those benefits include a range of industry-recognised qualifications as well as practical experience and generic job skills; praises the work done by Barnardos Youthbuild Project in Paisley and congratulates Kibble Youthbuild on its Youthbuild initiative, which offers employment training placements and support to young care leavers; welcomes the collaboration between Kibble Youthbuild and Reid Kerr College, and further welcomes the support from local employers and training organisations.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4433.1</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Uist Defence Jobs Cuts</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4433) in the name of Alasdair Allan, leave out from first &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes with grave concern the impact of the proposals to scale down the missile test range in South Uist and the potential effect on jobs and the economy of the islands; notes the additional potential impact on St Kilda; believes that the strategic defence case for change of the current facilities has not been made and requires to be set out and scrutinised; notes the United Kingdom&rsquo;s continuing membership of NATO and the importance of that membership in retaining a strategic defence capacity from which the Uists will still benefit; supports Comraihle nan Eilean Siar in the efforts that it is making to coordinate and advance the case for the retention of the defence facilities in South Uist, and urges the Scottish Government to reverse urgently the huge reduction that it has made in the budget of Highlands and Islands Enterprise that is limiting the economic development prospects of areas such as South Uist.&quot;</p>
