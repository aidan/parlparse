<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5701</strong> <strong>David Whitton:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Demelza Hart and to Killermont Primary School, Bearsden</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Demelza Hart of Killermont Primary School, Bearsden, for designing the winning poster in the Food Standards Agency in Scotland and Consumer Focus Scotland Safe Food and Healthy Eating Calendar competition 2009 and notes that the competition attracted more than 4,000 entries from across Scotland, all promoting good food hygiene, healthy eating or food allergy awareness messages, making Demelza&rsquo;s success a fantastic national achievement, and that the TV chef, James Martin, officially presented her with a framed print of her winning design in front of the whole school. </p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5700</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Community Ownership at Ledgowan and Cadder</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the decision of Glasgow City Council to close community facilities across Glasgow; considers that Ledgowan Tenants&rsquo; Hall and Cadder Community Centre in Maryhill are valued by the groups that they serve, are important to the health and wellbeing of these communities and that these areas already lack a number of the amenities enjoyed by more prosperous locales; believes that this decision is consistent with the continued erosion of civic facilities in the area following the closure of St Agnes Primary School in 2009, and considers that these communities should now be supported by the local authority to explore the feasibility of community ownership.</p>
<p>Supported by: Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Anne McLaughlin<strong>*</strong>, Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-5699</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Sir John Dankworth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Sir John Dankworth; recognises his huge contribution to jazz, arguably as Britain&rsquo;s leading exponent of the art of modern jazz; expresses sympathy to his wife Cleo Laine, his children, Alec and Jacqui, and his friends, and shares the sentiments of modern jazz musician Jamie Cullum who called him a genius and said &quot;Sir John Dankworth - a great man and one of our finest musicians and composers has died. Rest in peace, sir&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5698</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Celebrating Global Non-genetically Modified Crop Successes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">welcomes a lengthening list of non-genetically modified seeds and crops that are being grown successfully around the world and that include allergen-free peanuts, striga-resistant cowpeas, salt and drought-resistant wheat, corn, maize and rice, beta-carotene rich sweet potatoes, virus-resistant cassavas and blight-resistant potatoes; recalls that the evidence of increased yields, environmental security and consistent results has never been proven for GM varieties; anticipates that non-GM plant varieties will continue to promote biodiversity, security of production in both subsistence and commercial farming; believes that these non-GM seeds and plants deserve far wider publicity and understanding, and congratulates scientists who are adding to the success of non-GM varieties across the globe.</span></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5697</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Global Alert to Stop Monsantoizing Food, Seeds and Animals</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes global action timed for late March 2010 in order to present governments, politicians and patent offices around the world with a call to stop the Monsantoizing of food, seeds and livestock, which is considered to be growing at an alarming rate; notes that individuals and organisations can sign the global alert petition at http://www.no-patents-on-seeds.org/monsantoizing.htm; encourages farmers, growers, crofters and consumers in Scotland to understand that rising food prices, the loss of independence and rising indebtedness for farmers, a reduction of plant and animal diversity, ever higher constraints for breeding and research activities and the concentration of the seed sector in the hands of a few multinational firms represent the most worrying impacts of this trend, and asks as many concerned citizens as possible to join this global alert.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5696</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Love Maggie&rsquo;s Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the first ever Love Maggie<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s Day on 26 March 2010; welcomes the fact that past, present and future fundraisers are being encouraged to do an activity that they love or for someone they love in the lead up to the event; notes that the day will be celebrated in each region across Scotland and that supporters will meet at Maggie<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s centres and form a chain to hug the building; considers Love Maggie<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s Day to be an excellent opportunity to raise awareness of the support that Maggie<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s offers people living with, through and beyond cancer and how important fundraising is to these services; recognises that the Maggie<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s Centre in Fife provides great comfort and hope to the people of Fife and their families who are affected by cancer, and congratulates the staff in the Maggie<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s Centre in Kirkcaldy for the quality of care and services provided.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5695</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>WWF&rsquo;s Earth Hour 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports WWF&rsquo;s Earth Hour 2010, in which, at 8.30pm on Saturday 27 March, thousands of people all over Scotland will join hundreds of millions across the globe in switching off their lights for 60 minutes in a demonstration of support for people and wildlife threatened by climate change; urges all local authorities and other public bodies to sign up to Earth Hour; considers that the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen failed to establish a sufficiently ambitious or binding framework capable of tackling the threat of climate change; considers that Scotland has shown leadership by setting the world&rsquo;s strongest statutory greenhouse gas targets, and calls on all nations to agree a legally binding global deal this year that sets stringent carbon emissions reduction targets at global and national levels.</p>

<p> <span lang=""><strong>*S3M-5694</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Strathclyde Taser Pilot</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the decision of the Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police to issue Taser guns to 30 frontline police officers following a three-day training course; notes the considerable concerns about the safety of Tasers raised by Amnesty International; further notes that at present Tasers are only issued to specially trained, authorised firearms officers as an additional less lethal option to conventional firearms; recognises that in order to become an authorised firearms officer a police officer must be selected and trained in order to reach the required level of competency in weapon handling, tactical knowledge, shooting skills and judgment and is thereafter subject to refresher training and re-qualification; further notes that, when a similar pilot took place in 10 police forces in England and Wales in 2007-08, Tasers were used by officers 661 times within a year and that they were used on children 34 times during this period; recognises that it was the Home Secretary who signed off on issuing Tasers to more frontline police officers following that pilot; believes that three days of training is not sufficient for officers with no previous training or experience of handling firearms, and further believes that extending the use of Tasers beyond firearms officers represents a shift in policy, not an operational decision, which requires ministerial sanction following independent evaluation and debate in the Parliament.</span></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5693</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Health Secretary Must End St Margaret&rsquo;s Fiasco</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments made by John Bannon, a non-executive board member of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, who is reported to have stated that board members have not been made aware of key aspects of the decisions made concerning the development of Blawarthill Hospital, which could lead to the proposed closure of beds at St Margaret of Scotland Hospice; further notes an article in <em>Scottish Review</em> by Kenneth Roy that raises serious questions about the Blawarthill proposal, and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate the serious issues raised by Messers Bannon and Roy with a view to resolving the future of St Margaret of Scotland Hospice.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5692</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>LGBT Centre Addressing Health Inequalities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Edinburgh-based LGBT Centre for Health and Wellbeing for the valuable and essential services that it provides to promote the mental health and wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Scotland; understands that, while there have been significant positive changes in legislation over the past decade, the everyday experience of LGBT people is that discrimination, prejudice and hate crime continue, which can have a devastating effect on self-esteem and lead to poor mental and physical health; supports the charity<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s vital work to address social isolation, poor mental health and health inequalities among one of Scotland<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s most invisible minorities, and wishes the charity every success in its vision of a Scotland where sexual orientation and gender identity do not act as barriers to accessing services or are indicators of poor health outcomes.</p>

<p> <span lang=""><strong>*S3M-5691</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Alcohol etc. (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Alcohol etc. (Scotland) Bill, agrees to (a) any expenditure of a kind referred to in Rule 9.12.3(b)(ii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders and (b) any charges or payments in relation to which Rule 9.12.4 of the Standing Orders applies, arising in consequence of the Act.</span> </p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5690</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>Diana and Actaeon Come to the Newly Restored McManus, Dundee&rsquo;s Art Gallery and Museum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates those involved in bringing the &pound;50 million Titian masterpiece, <em>Diana and Actaeon,</em> to Dundee; recognises that <em>Diana and Actaeon</em> has been seen by thousands of people in London and Edinburgh in the past year and that there has been a vigorous campaign to ensure that it receives the widest possible audience; notes that this announcement comes on the first anniversary of its acquisition by the National Galleries of Scotland and the National Gallery in London and celebrates the partnership between these British cultural institutions; further notes that this prestigious national acquisition will be hosted in the newly restored McManus, Dundee&rsquo;s Art Gallery and Museum, following its exhibition in Aberdeen and Glasgow, and believes that this positive message from the national galleries illustrates Dundee&rsquo;s status as a growing centre of culture.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5689</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Idling Engines</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament urges the Scottish Government to encourage all local authorities to follow the lead of Glasgow City Council in enacting bylaws to fine drivers who keep their engines running and considers that such idling causes unhealthy fumes and pollution and contributes to unnecessary CO<sub>2</sub> production.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5688</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Second Annual Grangemouth Music Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the second annual Grangemouth Music Festival, which is to take place on seven consecutive Saturdays between 1 May and 12 June 2010 and is to be run by Grangemouth Independent Retailers; congratulates Jim Waugh and Les Burkey, who are to head up the organisation of the event for a second year running following its successful debut last year as part of the Homecoming Scotland 2009 celebrations; notes that the festival is to benefit greatly from improvements being made to the bandstand in La Porte Precinct, following a &pound;35,000 award from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Town Centre Regeneration Fund; further notes that the festival will feature a broad mix of bands with Celtic rock and contemporary ceilidh band Skerryvore launching the event, and wishes all those organising, participating in and attending a very successful, entertaining and enjoyable festival.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-5621</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Tennent&rsquo;s Support for Minimum Price of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the growing consensus in favour of the minimum pricing of alcohol, including the recent backing by Scotland&rsquo;s largest brewer, Tennent&rsquo;s; welcomes the comments by Mike Lees, Managing Director of Tennent Caledonian, who views minimum pricing as &quot;part of an overall programme to reduce the abuses of alcohol&quot;; realises that minimum pricing seeks to raise the price of inexpensive ciders, lagers and low-grade spirits that contribute to high levels of alcohol misuse, and understands that this targeting will ultimately benefit the people of Scotland.</p>

<p> <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><strong>*S3M-5621.1</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Tennent&rsquo;s Support for Minimum Price of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5621) in the name of Michael Matheson, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that the University of Sheffield study of minimum unit pricing indicates that the profit that would accrue to retailers and alcohol producers is in the order of &pound;90 million per year if the unit price is set at 40p; further notes that the amount being spent on alcohol treatment by the Scottish Government is &pound;120 million over three years, which represents less than half of the money that would be generated by a minimum unit price over the same period, and strongly believes that this money is better spent on alcohol education, treatment and enforcement rather than increasing the profits of retailers and alcohol producers.&quot;</span></p>
