<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4261</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Credit Unions Versus Loan Sharks</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is aware of the infamous activity of loan sharks in today&rsquo;s difficult economic circumstances; deplores their squalid and parasitical focusing on those without work and other citizens on low incomes; believes that measures must be taken to defeat these parasites; is convinced that an expanding credit-union movement, with the appropriate local and national support, is the most effective antidote to this obnoxious practice, especially in communities characterised by deprivation and disadvantage; praises the fine work performed in such areas by members of the credit-union movement, and calls on all of those organisations and agencies that have the wherewithal to support constructively our credit unions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4260</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Piping Live!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Piping Live!, Glasgow&rsquo;s International Piping Festival; notes that the Festival, which runs between 10 and 16 August 2009, is expected to attract more than 50,000 people to the city and features the World Pipe Band Championships on Glasgow Green on 15 August; further notes that Piping Live! is this year part of the Homecoming Scotland 2009 celebrations and will feature some of the best names in traditional music, with everything from pipes to fiddles and rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll as well as traditional Scottish dancing, and wishes the festival well in 2009 and years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4259</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>4,000 Mile Cycle Journey from Glasgow to Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the four Glasgow-based students who set off on their incredible 4,000 mile journey from Glasgow&rsquo;s George Square to Gaza on 27 May 2009 in order to raise funds for Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP); notes that the journey will take 40 days, passing through at least 14 countries; further notes that the cyclists&rsquo; Pathways to Palestine (P2P) idea stemmed from the continuing blockade of Gaza; congratulates the P2P team members on their innovative use of phlogging, which will allow their sponsors and supporters to follow their progress via their website and by email, and commends MAP&rsquo;s continued work, which, following the recent conflict, is concentrated on providing support to young mothers and victims with burn injuries.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4258</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Keep Largo and Lundin Links in North East Fife</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, despite overwhelming opposition, the Boundary Commission for Scotland&rsquo;s revised recommendations for Scottish Parliament constituencies retains the provisional proposal to move the communities of Lundin Links, Lower Largo and Upper Largo from the North East Fife constituency to the proposed new constituency of Mid Fife and Glenrothes; recognises that residents of Largo and Lundin Links consider that they have strong local ties to the East Neuk and north east Fife and that this was confirmed by Sheriff Principal Mr R A Dunlop QC in his report on the local inquiry into the provisional proposals last September, which stated &quot;in my judgement this inquiry has thrown up as strong an example of such local ties as one is likely to find&quot;; believes that the Boundary Commission for Scotland has failed to give due weight to public opinion and to exercise its discretion, under constituency rule 4, to take account of local ties that may be broken, and urges the commission to reconsider its recommendation for the North East Fife constituency and keep Largo and Lundin Links in North East Fife.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4257</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>A Citizen&rsquo;s Right to Privacy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the reported &pound;1 billion allotted to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) for developing its monitoring technology, while disapproving of the estimated &pound;2 billion cost of the UK Government&rsquo;s plan to maintain a vast network of corporate databases containing the public&rsquo;s communications data; remembers the UK Government&rsquo;s poor track record for safeguarding sensitive information and recognises that the who, when and where of communication is highly intrusive and personally sensitive; questions this use of resources at a time when the Scottish Government is being asked to make cuts in vital public services, and hopes that UK ministers will appreciate a citizen&rsquo;s rights to privacy, freedom and trust, which, seemingly, as experienced so often under Labour, have been disregarded.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4253</strong> <strong>Jackson Carlaw:</strong> <strong>Carolside Primary School Parent Council AGM</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that section 7 of the constitution of East Renfrewshire&rsquo;s Carolside Primary School&rsquo;s Parent Council states that all meetings of the Parent Council are open to all members of the Parent Forum and to the public; further notes that, at the AGM of Carolside Primary School Parent Council on 20 May 2009, the Director of Education of Labour-controlled East Renfrewshire Council, with support from the Labour education convener, ejected from the meeting a member of the public and a reporter from local newspaper <em>The Extra </em>at the point where the council proposed to outline its plans to increase dramatically class sizes at the school; condemns this breach of both the constitution of the Carolside Primary School Parent Council and the basic principles of local democracy, and calls on the chief executive of East Renfrewshire Council to offer an official apology to those ejected from the meeting, along with an assurance that the council will act with more care in the future.</p>
