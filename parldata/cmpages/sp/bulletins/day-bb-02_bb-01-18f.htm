          <p><strong>*S1M-2623#</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott: Lifeline Air Links 
            to the Islands</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that the 
            lifeline air services to the Scottish islands are necessities, not 
            luxuries; believes that the commercial air fares charged by the airlines 
            are a tax on island life, handicapping individuals, businesses and 
            public bodies alike, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            enter into discussions with Her Majesty's Government and the airlines 
            with a view to using a Public Service Obligation subsidy to reduce 
            the airfares to a more reasonable level.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2622</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: Cross-Party 
            Support for a Review of the Construction Industry in Scotland</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the importance of the construction industry 
            to the Scottish economy and the contribution it makes to supporting 
            employment and vocational education and training; notes that nine 
            out of every 10 construction firms employ less than eight people; 
            acknowledges that the reputation of the whole industry is damaged 
            by the actions of rogue traders, particularly within the residential 
            sector, and that small businesses contend that their profitability 
            and competitiveness is adversely affected by the system of cash retentions, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should initiate a strategic 
            review of construction in Scotland in order to (a) identify how best 
            to combat the &quot;cowboy&quot; element, (b) support the education 
            and training infrastructure so that it is able to meet the skill requirements 
            of the industry, (c) examine the possibility of developing an inspection 
            and assessment regime to evaluate the competence of construction companies, 
            (d) address the system of cash retentions and (e) ensure that the 
            provisions within the existing construction contracts legislation 
            deliver a process that is fair, effective and easy to understand.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2621#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie: Fair Trade Fortnight</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that 4-17 March 2002 is Fair Trade Fortnight 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should endorse the use of 
            Fair Trade produce, in particular by encouraging schools to incorporate 
            Fair Trade as an element within their curricula and should promote 
            it through other activity.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2620</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick: Miners' Pension 
            Scheme</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the £8 million released 
            from Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury to miners' pension schemes; notes 
            that many ex-miners or widows of ex-miners are living in poverty while 
            HM Treasury receives £250 million per year from the profits of the 
            schemes; further notes that Her Majesty's Government will take over 
            £4 billion from the schemes, and demands that Her Majesty's Government 
            return all of the profits to the pension schemes to allow the ex-miners 
            and their families to receive the benefits of the scheme to which 
            they contributed. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2619</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Public Appointments 
            (Parliamentary Approval) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            agrees to the general principles of the Public Appointments (Parliamentary 
            Approval) (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2618</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Remove the 
            Shackles</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with regret the increasingly 
            partisan approach of Labour members to &quot;take note&quot; motions 
            and motions for members&#146; business; is aware that of the 14 outstanding 
            such motions submitted by Liberal Democrat MSPs to attract signatures 
            at 11 January 2002, 13 have attracted support from SNP members but 
            none have the support of their Labour coalition partners; realises 
            that, in contrast, of the 33 Labour motions, 23 have attracted Liberal 
            Democrat, 31 SNP and 19 Conservative support; acknowledges that of 
            70 SNP motions outstanding, 31 obtained Liberal Democrat, 19 Conservative 
            but only 11 Labour support; recognises that, when given, Labour support 
            is token and comes from only one or two members with specific constituency 
            or special interests; is surprised that even motions previously signed 
            by Labour members do not attract the same signatures when subsequently 
            re-submitted indicating a tightening of the Labour Whips&#146; control; 
            further acknowledges that such an approach has meant no Labour backing 
            at all for motions on such issues as Female Genital Mutilation, International 
            Year of Mountains and Donald Whyte, Genealogist; believes that Labour 
            Whips are preventing Labour members from signing perfectly innocuous, 
            non-partisan motions and thus undermining the very ethos of the &quot;new 
            politics&quot; the Parliament should represent; expresses surprise 
            at the lack of self-confidence, lack of faith and insecurity that 
            this approach displays; accepts that while all parties have a right 
            to express their views robustly in the Chamber, in committees and 
            in the media, there is still room for cross-party co-operation on 
            a host of issues, not least those raised in members&#146; business 
            motions; commends Conservative, Green, Independent, Liberal Democrat, 
            SNP and SSP members for acting in the true spirit of the Parliament 
            in this regard but expresses disappointment that Labour control freakery 
            prevents Labour members from doing likewise; considers that Labour 
            members cannot reasonably expect support from non-Labour members for 
            their motions when they have no intention of reciprocating, and therefore 
            appeals to Labour Whips to remove the shackles on their members to 
            allow free expression of support for non-partisan motions, and indeed 
            members&#146; Bills, on their merits, before colleagues in other parties, 
            irritated by Labour&#146;s politically sectarian attitude, feel obliged 
            to react in similar fashion.</p>
