          <p><strong>*S1M-3563</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Mouth Cancer Awareness 
            Week</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that the second Mouth 
            Cancer Awareness Week runs from 10-16 November 2002; congratulates 
            the Tayside Community Dental Service and other agencies throughout 
            Scotland for their efforts to inform the public about this disease; 
            notes with concern that in Scotland there are approximately 500 new 
            cases of oral cancer and 250 deaths per year, that less than 50% of 
            cases will survive five years and that the incidence of oral cancer 
            is on the increase in younger people, and encourages the Scottish 
            Executive to assist in raising public awareness of preventative measures 
            such as giving up smoking, reducing alcohol consumption and, most 
            importantly, visiting a dentist at least once a year.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3562</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Maggie's Centre 
            - Westen Infirmary, Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament warmly welcomes 
            the opening of the new Maggie's Centre in the Western Infirmary gatehouse 
            in Glasgow which will specialise in supporting people with cancer, 
            carers and their families and includes an extensive cancer information 
            library and internet access; expresses its delight at the overwhelming 
            public support in Glasgow for the Maggie's Centre, and congratulates 
            all those who have participated in fund-raising efforts to make the 
            centre possible.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3561</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Ability of 
            Holyrood Progress Group</strong>-That the Parliament has no confidence 
            in the ability of the Holyrood Progress Group to achieve any of its 
            own declared aims which are to deal competently with question and 
            answer sessions for MSPs, monitor and report on the progress of the 
            Holyrood project and control expenditure so as to ensure that the 
            Parliament takes delivery of a world-class building on budget and 
            on time, and resolves to exert a greater measure of client control 
            over the project by dissolving the group and appointing an experienced 
            building industry professional to represent the Parliament and the 
            public interest on the Holyrood Project Team in place of the current 
            Project Director. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3560</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: The Draft Genetically 
            Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) (Scotland) Regulations 2002</strong>-That 
            the Transport and the Environment Committee recommends that the draft 
            Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) (Scotland) Regulations 
            2002 be approved.&quot;</p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3559</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Street Football 
            for All</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes the 
            work of the C.A.F.E. Project, a highly successful and nationally recognised 
            voluntary organisation which provides a one-stop shop for leisure, 
            culture, health, education and employment facilities and outdoor activities 
            for people under 25 in the Arbroath area, which was recently described 
            by Tony Andrews, Director of the British Council in Germany as "extraordinary, 
            innovative and inspiring in the way it reconnects young people with 
            the mainstream - a model for working with disadvantaged young people"; 
            congratulates the project on its plans to develop "Street Football 
            For All" alongside the national &quot;Dreams and Teams&quot; project, 
            which seeks to promote sport, health and active citizenship by using 
            football to bring together young people from Scotland and Germany 
            and 15 other countries of the world to increase understanding and 
            tolerance, and wishes the projects every success with this excellent 
            initiative which meaningfully embodies equality and social inclusion</a></p>
