          <p><strong>*S2M-222#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Lottery</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the recent news that 
            the National Lottery is facing financial difficulty under its current 
            operation following a steady drop in sales; further notes with concern 
            the resulting decrease in money for good causes; recognises some of 
            the reasons for the fall of interest in the National Lottery; welcomes 
            Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s pledge to &quot;give the lottery 
            back to the people&quot;, and therefore considers that a not-for-profit 
            Scottish lottery should be set up with the money spent by lottery 
            customers in Scotland exclusively used for the benefit of the people 
            and communities of Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-221</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Flooding 
            in Selkirk and Yarrow Valley</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            the major damage done to properties in Selkirk and the Yarrow valley 
            caused by major floods that occurred on 30 May 2003; condemns the 
            slow response of many private insurers to support clients in the immediate 
            aftermath; recognises that there is still considerable damage to private 
            homes, rented accommodation and public property that needs to be repaired 
            and that over 70 households need to be decanted; is concerned that 
            there is an acute shortage of alternative accommodation, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to work with all the agencies, including 
            housing associations, to act urgently in ensuring that people suffer 
            as little distress and disruption as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-220</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Children's 
            Hospice at Balloch</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the 
            commencement of construction work on Scotland's second children's 
            hospice at Balloch; recognises the considerable work of the Children's 
            Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) in providing a caring and supportive 
            environment for terminally-ill children and their families; applauds 
            the tremendous effort of volunteers in Dunbartonshire and throughout 
            Scotland who have worked so hard to raise funds; notes that £7 million 
            of the £10 million required to build, equip and maintain the new hospice 
            at Balloch has been raised; further notes that an additional £3 million 
            is needed to ensure that CHAS has sufficient reserves to underpin 
            the cost of running Robin House, and recognises that, with continued 
            voluntary effort and the generosity shown by many people, this target 
            will be achieved by the completion date for the building of Robin 
            House Children's Hospice in August 2004.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-219</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Citizen 
            Y Youth Project</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the 
            young people involved in the Edinburgh youth project, Citizen Y, on 
            their mural at St John&#146;s Church called &quot;Who are you calling 
            a ned?&quot;; welcomes such positive images of young people in the 
            current climate of scapegoating and stigma and acknowledges that building 
            productive relationships with young people depends upon giving them 
            the respect and opportunities that they appear to lack from their 
            elected representatives at the moment.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-218</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Save 
            Scotland's Ink Recycling Industry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            notes with concern the potential impact that the implementation of 
            EU Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment 
            could have on the business of ink cartridge refill shops and the prices 
            of printer ink and toner for the Scottish consumer; endorses the petition 
            under way at cartridge refill shops across Scotland, and calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to make representations to the United Kingdom's 
            Department for Trade and Industry to ensure that the transposition 
            of the directive into domestic Scots law does not penalise Scottish 
            businesses or consumers in favour of multinational manufacturers of 
            ink cartridges.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-217</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Freedom 
            to Express Scottish Identity</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            with dismay that the University of Aberdeen Careers Advisory Service 
            advises students that, when applying for jobs, they should define 
            themselves as "British" rather than "Scottish" in<font color="#0000ff"> 
            </font>order to enhance their employment prospects; believes that 
            this advice is misplaced and symptomatic of the Scottish cringe which 
            has held Scotland back for decades and undermines the confidence of 
            young Scots; calls on any advice providers to recognise that increasing 
            numbers of Scots view themselves as Scottish first and foremost and 
            welcomes this increasing self-confidence, and believes that, in the 
            unlikely event that any employer were to downgrade applicants because 
            they took pride in their Scottish identity, such an action would be 
            utterly foolish and counterproductive.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-216</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Use 
            of Cannabis for the Relief of Pain</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            salutes the courage, integrity and tenacity of Biz Ivol in her campaign 
            to change the laws on cannabis in order to enable MS sufferers such 
            as herself to legally use the substance for the relief of pain; regrets 
            that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service judged her prosecution 
            to be in the public interest when common sense and humanity dictate 
            otherwise, and calls on the Scottish Executive to instigate an immediate 
            public consultation on changing the provisions of the criminal law 
            in Scotland in respect of the use of cannabis for the relief of pain.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-214</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>National 
            Endometriosis Awareness Day</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
            National Endometriosis Awareness Day on 2 July 2003; notes that endometriosis 
            is a gynaecological disease that affects up to two million women in 
            the United Kingdom causing extreme pain, infertility, depression and 
            incapacity for work or social interaction, and recognises the need 
            to raise awareness of this condition.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Rosie Kane*</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-213</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Primary 
            Medical Services (Scotland) Bill - Financial Resolution</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament 
            resulting from the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Bill, agrees 
            to any increase in expenditure of the Scottish Ministers payable out 
            of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-212</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>West 
            of Scotland Racial Equality Council</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            congratulates the West of Scotland Race Equality Council on the successful 
            launch of its anti-racism pack for school managers working with children 
            and young people and recognises the positive contribution the council 
            has made to addressing race issues in Scotland, its willingness to 
            work in partnership with other agencies in tackling the problems of 
            racism in Scotland and the valuable contribution made to the development 
            of the council by its Director, Maggie Chetty, who is retiring after 
            18 years&#146; commitment to the organisation.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-211</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Parliament's

            the recent announcement that its in-house mail service will be transferred 
            to the responsibility of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body 
            and congratulates all members of the Royal Mail staff for the professional

          <p><strong>*S2M-210</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> 
            <strong>Respect for Shopworkers Day, 17 September 2003</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the level of violence and abuse 
            that shopworkers deal with on a daily basis; further notes the recent 
            survey by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied workers (USDAW) 
            that found that 47% of those responding to the survey reported physical 
            attacks or assaults on staff in the last 12 months, that 72% reported 
            staff being threatened with violence, that in one in four stores threats 
            are being made every week, that in one-third of stores verbal abuse 
            is a daily event, that almost 50% of staff have taken time off work 
            as a result of violence and that stress-related problems are common 
            and include sickness, insomnia, headaches and clinical depression; 
            commends the USDAW campaign, &quot;Freedom from Fear&quot;&#146; and 
            recognises its main objectives as raising awareness of the level of 
            violence and abuse, making the workplace safer and protecting both 
            shoppers and staff, and supports &quot;Respect for Shopworkers Day&quot; 
            on 17 September 2003 aimed at preventing abusive behaviour, highlighting 
            the support that retail companies can, and do, give their staff and 
            encouraging the public to show respect for shopworkers.</p>

            vision of the Wester Ross Marine Reserve Partnership, the Hebridean 
            Marine National Park Partnership and the Fair Isle Marine Environment 
            and Tourism Initiative; agrees with these groups that it is vital 
            to achieve an integrated coastal zone management around Scotland with 
            local communities playing a lead role, and recommends the commencement 
            of formal consultations with these local communities on the establishment
