         <p>9.30 am&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>

         <p><strong>S2M-2507</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>School Meals and Our Children&rsquo;s Future</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that all serious nutritionists are predicting that obesity will double in Scotland over the next 10 years, causing a health crisis which will dramatically increase demand for health services and lower average life expectancy; therefore endorses the principle that radical action is required to tackle Scotland&rsquo;s diet-related health problems; believes that there can be no better use of Scotland&rsquo;s resources than to invest in our children&rsquo;s future, and congratulates the National Assembly for Wales and the city councils of Hull and Glasgow for their action in providing free breakfasts for all primary children and the councils for their further commitment to extending free, nutritious school lunches to all their primary school pupils. </p>

         <p> <strong>S2M-2507.2</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott: School Meals and Our Children&rsquo;s Future</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2507) in the name of Frances Curran, insert at end &quot;further commends the Food for Life pilot programme which is delivering not only healthy, local organic school meals, but also a range of educational activities which reconnect children with a healthy food culture and with how their food is produced, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make a commitment to supporting locally-produced GM-free organic food for school meals provision in Scotland&quot;. </p>
         <p><em>followed by</em> &#9;Scottish Socialist Party Debate: The Right to Protest at Gleneagles&mdash;</p>
         <p><strong>S2M-2506</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>The Right to Protest at Gleneagles</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament puts on record its support for Article 20 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that &quot;everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association&quot;; notes that the G8 summit will be meeting in Gleneagles in July this year, and resolves to uphold and support the right to peaceful assembly and protest in Scotland, in particular in Edinburgh at the Make Poverty History demonstration and at the summit itself in Gleneagles. </p>
         <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
         <p><strong>S2M-2506.4</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe: The Right to Protest at Gleneagles</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2506) in the name of Rosie Kane, insert at end &quot;further recognises that protestors have responsibilities to uphold the law and deplores calls by an unrepresentative minority to use the occasion to engage in unlawful and violent activity; pledges full endorsement of the work of the Scottish Police Service to ensure public safety and order and facilitate peaceful protest; welcomes the tremendous opportunity presented by the G8 to show to a watching world everything that is good about Scotland and Scotland&rsquo;s people, and acknowledges that the summit is also an opportunity to encourage debate, raise awareness and challenge people within Scotland about the key issues of poverty in Africa and climate change.&quot; </p>

         <p> <strong>S2M-2506.1</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: The Right to Protest at Gleneagles</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2506) in the name of Rosie Kane, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that suitable measures are taken to deter those who seek to abuse such rights through disorderly behaviour and by causing damage to property as well as thwarting the peaceful expression of views by those who attend in good faith.&quot; </p>
