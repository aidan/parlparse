<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7693 Jim Mather: Electricity Market Reform</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the UK Government&rsquo;s electricity market reform proposals and their importance to the delivery of the Parliament&rsquo;s climate change and low-carbon energy objectives for Scotland; agrees that the related UK review of Ofgem and the transmission charging regime is an opportunity to deliver a more equitable system that is fit to help deliver Scotland&rsquo;s massive low-carbon energy potential that will bring economic and other benefits to communities across Scotland; further notes the Parliament&rsquo;s existing powers with regard to renewables and carbon capture and storage (CCS), which it believes should, at a minimum, be left intact; believes that the Parliament should continue to use these powers in support of the development of Scotland&rsquo;s low-carbon energy potential; urges the UK Government to work closely with the Scottish Government to ensure that reforms further incentivise clean energy and incentivise energy demand reduction, as set out in the <em>Draft Electricity Generation Policy Statement 2010</em>; calls on the UK Government and Scottish Government to work together to help fulfil Scotland&rsquo;s low-carbon potential, and further urges the UK Government to ensure full and immediate consultation with the Parliament on these proposals.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7692 Des McNulty: Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the reduction in the number of teachers under the SNP by almost 3,000 since 2007 and the sharp rise in the proportion of recently qualified teachers who cannot obtain permanent or even temporary employment; notes that the percentage of newly qualified staff who have obtained full-time permanent posts has fallen to just 16.1%, a record low; expresses concern that pupil/teacher ratios are rising across Scotland and many colleges have insufficient bursary funds to meet demand, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to apologise for getting involved in local authority decisions outwith his regional constituency instead of tackling the impact that fewer teachers, more unemployed recently qualified teachers, higher pupil/teacher ratios and a shortfall in bursary funding will have on education in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7691 Sandra White: Aspect Prize Winner</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow artist, Adam Kennedy, on winning the Aspect Prize, one of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s largest independently funded arts prizes, established by Charles Jamieson and organised in conjunction with the Paisley Art Institute in an annual exhibition at the Paisley Art Gallery and Museum, with the four finalists showcasing their work at the Aspect Prize Winners&rsquo; London Exhibition held at The Fleming Collection; considers that the Aspect Prize and the The Fleming Collection, the largest private collection of Scottish art, have done great work in promoting and encouraging Scottish art and artists, and wishes Adam and the three other finalists continuing success in the future.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Maureen Watt<strong>*</strong>, Jim Tolson<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7682&diams;   Michael Matheson: Denny Town Centre Regeneration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that there is widespread dissatisfaction among residents in the Denny and Dunipace area regarding the planned Denny town centre regeneration; believes that Denny town centre is in desperate need of regeneration, and would welcome regeneration plans that carry widespread support in the local community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7681&diams;   John Scott: Save the River Doon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the application made by Scottish Power to reduce by 27% the water flow in the River Doon; expresses its concern at the potentially adverse effect that such a reduction in water flow would have on the ecology of the river, on the tourist economy of Ayrshire and Scotland to which the river contributes and on the quality of bathing waters around Ayr; considers that the River Doon has an iconic place in the culture of Scotland, particularly through the works of Robert Burns, and does not believe that the water flow in the river should be reduced.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7680 Ms Wendy Alexander: Oppose the Deskilling of Teaching in Renfrewshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemnsRenfrewshire Council for having cut teacher numbers by 244 since the current leadership came to power in 2007, proportionately more than any other local authority in Scotland; notes Renfrewshire&rsquo;s plans to axe the number of classroom assistants by 70 in the coming financial year; further condemnsthe authority&rsquo;s plans to cut, from August 2011, the teaching time in every Renfrewshire Primary School by 10% and to axe the number of primary teachers by more than 60 and replace them with 120 part-timesessional workers; notes that the sessional workers will be paid from funding from the European Social Fund of &pound;14 per hour inclusive of on-costs compared with &pound;29.58 per hour for a qualified teacher; understands that this will mean that all Renfrewshire primary pupils will, in future, be given lessons by part-time non-teachers for one tenth of the school week; deplores what it considers to be the lack of consultation with parents, teachers or teaching unions;notes the absence of both a published training programme for the sessional workers and anypublished safeguards for teaching quality, discipline or behaviour when they take charge later thisyear; calls on Renfrewshire Council&rsquo;s education board to reject what are believed to be misguided plans when it meets on 13 January 2011, and supports all those parents and others who are campaigning locally against what it sees as a schooling-on-the-cheap plan.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7679 Jackie Baillie: School Closure Plans Halted</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Argyll and Bute Council to halt the consultation process on the proposed closure of 25 of its primary schools; understands that the Lib Dem/Independent-led administration has agreed to halt the process that was originally started by the previous SNP/Independent-led administration; further understands that substantial flaws have been exposed in the consultation documents that would have led to the proposals being called in by the Scottish Government in any event; praises the hard work and dedication of the pupils, parents, teachers and the Argyll and Scottish Rural Schools Networks in campaigning against these proposals; considers that Argyll and Bute has been left with the worst local authority settlement in Scotland, resulting in severe pressure on its finances, and calls on the Scottish Government to engage in dialogue with the council to mitigate the cuts.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7678 Jackie Baillie: West Dunbartonshire Budget Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the SNP-led West Dunbartonshire Council will reduce its budget by &pound;14.7 million; considers that the SNP has slashed over &pound;3 million from social work services in the last year, including cuts to vital frontline services; further considers that, on top of the cuts being made, the SNP has imposed millions of pounds of additional charges for essential services and equipment; understands that West Dunbartonshire Council has had a reduced budget from the Scottish Government, with a cut of 4.53% in cash terms, equating to the loss of &pound;12 million this year; further understands that this budget cut is significantly higher than the average of 2.6% across Scotland, and calls on both the Scottish Government and the SNP-led West Dunbartonshire Council to reverse the damaging cuts that it considers they are making to vital services in West Dunbartonshire.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7670 Michael Matheson: Green Bus Fund Good for Jobs in Camelon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the creation of the &pound;4.4 million Scottish Green Bus Fund established by the Scottish Government; considers that this will contribute to Scotland&rsquo;s world-leading climate change targets through the manufacture of low-carbon buses, and also notes that 46 of the 50 buses will be built by Alexander Dennis Ltd based in Camelon, which will be of economic benefit to the Falkirk area.</p>
