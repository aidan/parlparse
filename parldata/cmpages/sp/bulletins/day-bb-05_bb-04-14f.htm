That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </p>
          <p><strong> Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p> A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></p>

          <p align="center"><strong> New and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2697 Brian Adam:Supporting People&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament regrets that Aberdeen City Council has had to make &pound;2.1 million of efficiency savings from its Supporting People budget; recognises that these efficiency savings are actually cuts which will affect the most vulnerable Aberdonians, and condemns the Scottish Executive for failing to provide Aberdeen with adequate resources to fund its Supporting People programme. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2696 Mr Adam Ingram:National Depression Week, 18 to 24 April 2005&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament recognises that one-in-five people will suffer from depression, making it the most common medical condition in Scotland; notes that the World Health Organisation has stated that depression will become the biggest burden on the health service, second only to heart disease, by 2020, and commends the work of voluntary organisations in this field, in particular Depression Alliance Scotland, who will this year use the theme of National Depression Week of people pulling together, specifically employers, policy-makers, healthcare professionals, family and friends, to defeat the illness, better cope with the condition and help recovery.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2695 Mr Mark Ruskell:Tesco&rsquo;s Profits&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes the &pound;2 billion profit reported by Tesco; further notes that the average farm income is only &pound;11,500; is concerned by reports from the National Farmers Union in Scotland that farmers receive just 17 pence a litre for milk that costs 19 pence a litre to produce; condemns the supermarket practice of paying farmers below the costs of production for milk and other produce; is further concerned by recent news that Kettle Produce Ltd, a food supplier of Tesco, is facing job losses in north-east Fife as a result of being squeezed by multinational companies in the retailing industry; notes new research by ActionAid that exposes the appalling working conditions of thousands of women workers in South Africa, casual labourers who grow fruit for Tesco, who are exposed to pesticides without protective clothing and receive poverty wages equivalent to a paltry &pound;32.50 for two weeks&rsquo; work, which barely gives them enough money to feed their families; further condemns Tesco for its predatory behaviour and exploitative practices; notes the failure of the Office of Fair Trading to effectively regulate the increasing power of large supermarkets, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use its influence to ensure that the Supermarket Code of Practice provides effective protection for those in Scotland and abroad who produce our food.</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2694.1 Jim Mather:Skills&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2694) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &ldquo;which has helped&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;and encourages the Executive to embark on a twofold strategy of radically improving the competitiveness of Scotland as recorded annually by IMD of Switzerland and increasingly matching the ability of other parts of the developed world to retain and attract skilled people and the type of investment that capitalises on existing skills and develops yet more skills here in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2694.2 Murdo Fraser:Skills&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2694) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to end and insert<strong></strong>&ldquo;notes the success of the Modern Apprenticeship scheme initiated in the mid-1990s by a Conservative government which has trained over 75,000 people in Scotland and which is currently providing skills training for over 31,000; notes with disappointment figures from the Futureskills Scotland 2004 report which show that 29% of applicants to skill shortage posts lacked basic literacy skills and 24% lacked basic numeracy skills; notes with concern findings from the same report that between 40 and 50% of employers who have recruited school leavers report that they are not well-prepared for work, and calls for more effective school-college partnerships with a view to improving the skills base of the economy.&rdquo;</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2693.1 Mr Tom McCabe:Council Tax&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2693) in the name of Alasdair Morgan, leave out from first &ldquo;council tax&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;Scottish Executive has established the independent inquiry into local government finance consistent with the Partnership Agreement of May 2003; notes that, because of the ongoing inquiry, there are no plans for a council tax revaluation in Scotland; notes that the Labour Party has submitted clear and detailed proposals to support changes to the council tax and that the Liberal Democrats have submitted clear and detailed proposals to support a local income tax, and therefore encourages all parties and others to make submissions to the inquiry.&rdquo;</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2693.2 Mr Brian Monteith:Council Tax&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2693) in the name of Alasdair Morgan, leave out from &ldquo;; further notes&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;and that it is this large rise, and not the tax itself, that has made the cost of local council services a greater political priority and a punishing burden for so many Scottish households; believes that to offer a sustainable and fair solution, therefore, a complete review is required of local authority responsibilities and direct payment of some of these by the Scottish Executive so that council tax may be substantially cut; notes that only the Conservatives are offering such a seismic shift by transferring the full cost of schools to the Executive&rsquo;s Education Department which could result in a 35%, or &pound;384, reduction in Band D council tax for every household, while proposals for a local income tax would maintain the existing total tax take and would only change who pays what amount, and believes that Labour&rsquo;s proposal for the introduction of a new top band will place a disproportionate burden on a small minority, while a new lower band will be of major benefit to the Treasury through reduced council tax benefit payments.&rdquo;</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2691.1 Alex Johnstone:Nuclear Power&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2691) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from first &ldquo;UK Government&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;House of Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee concluded in its report, <em>Meeting Scotland&rsquo;s Future Energy Needs, </em>that it is &ldquo;vital that decisions are taken now, to obviate the possibility of, quite literally, the lights going out in Scotland in the foreseeable future&rdquo;; further notes that nuclear power is currently estimated to save the United Kingdom annual emissions of eight million tonnes, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to support any plans brought forward by the UK Government to replace current nuclear power stations with new nuclear power stations in order to protect our energy supply, protect existing jobs and reduce our CO 2 emissions.&rdquo;</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2691.2 Mr Jim Wallace:Nuclear Power&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2691) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &ldquo;that the Committee&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;the work of the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s study into present and future energy supply and demand in Scotland; endorses the Executive&rsquo;s position of not supporting the further development of nuclear power stations while waste management issues remain unresolved; supports the Executive&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the development of renewable energy in Scotland, including wind, wave, tidal, solar hydrogen, biofuels and biomass power, as a key element of a balanced energy supply portfolio; supports the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to achieving 40% renewable electricity generation by 2020, and welcomes the ongoing review of the Scottish Climate Change Programme and the priority being given to strengthening the contribution of energy efficiency and renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.&rdquo;</p>

          <p><strong> * S2M-2691.3 Chris Ballance:Nuclear Power&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-2691) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert after fourth &ldquo;waste&rdquo; &ldquo;notes that the industry proposal to base electricity supply on identical reactors of the unproven AP1000 design would undermine the security of electricity supply; notes that the amount set aside from nuclear generation revenues over the last 50 years to pay for decommissioning of existing nuclear power stations is only sufficient to fund the first two years of the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency&rsquo;s 30-year programme and therefore that the multi-billion cost of decommissioning existing nuclear power stations will have to be paid for by future generations of tax payers and therefore considers that nuclear power is economically unsustainable; further notes that, over its whole life cycle, nuclear power is not carbon-neutral and agrees with the Chief Executive of the Energy Saving Trust that &ldquo;to present nuclear power as one of the main ways of combating climate change is short-sighted&rdquo;; believes that renewable energy and energy efficiency offer a truly secure and sustainable energy future&rdquo;.</p>
