          <p><strong>*S1M-2248</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Care Development

            of the Care Development Group and welcomes the opportunity for a full 
            parliamentary debate on the detail of the recommendations contained 
            in the report; further welcomes the Scottish Executive's pledge to 
            make personal care free for all elderly people from April 2002 whilst 
            noting that aspects of the detail of this commitment require further 
            clarification; notes in particular that the £125 million set aside 
            by the Scottish Executive will not be sufficient to fund the recommendations 
            of the Care Development Group unless Her Majesty's Government agrees 
            to allow those currently eligible for Attendance Allowance to retain 
            this benefit, notwithstanding their entitlement to free personal care; 
            believes that, as a matter of principle, any such shortfall should 
            not be met from within existing Scottish Executive resources, and 
            calls on Her Majesty's Government to make the necessary amendments 
            to the social security regulations or, alternatively, to transfer 
            the resources that will be saved as a result of the withdrawal of 
            Attendance Allowance to the Scottish Executive.</p>
