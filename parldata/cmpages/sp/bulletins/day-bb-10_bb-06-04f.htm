<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6503 Patricia Ferguson: The Leprosy Mission Scotland, Justice Tour</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the work carried out by the the Leprosy Mission since its establishment in 1874; notes that leprosy is a curable disease but that the stigma and social problems encountered by those affected by leprosy can result in their being ostracised by their communities, deprived of an education and, in some countries, deemed a non-person, and congratulates the Leprosy Mission Scotland on its successful justice tour currently being undertaken by the Leprosy Mission country leaders, Sunil Annand, India, Jean Pierre Brechet, Angola, Yousif Deng, Sudan and Yeuk Ming Poon, China and Laos, to highlight the plight of those affected by this disease.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6502 Jim Tolson: The Bruce Festival 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Bruce Festival, from 19 to 29 August 2010, celebrating the life, myth and legend of King Robert the Bruce, in Dunfermline, Scotland&rsquo;s ancient capital city, featuring music, a son et lumi&egrave;re at Dunfermline Abbey, battle re-enactments, displays of medieval camp life and an international street market; acknowledges that this year the festival is timed to link in with other international events such as the Edinburgh Festival; notes that full details are available at www.visitdunfermline.com, and recognises the positive effect of such cultural events on domestic and international tourism raising the profile of Scotland&rsquo;s many attractions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6501 Rhona Brankin: Congratulations to Gorebridge Community Development Trust on Big Lottery Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Gorebridge Community Development Trust on its award of &pound;835,000 from the Big Lottery Fund; recognises that this will help greatly toward its target of &pound;3.2 million needed for a new community hub, which would provide office space for charity, community and youth groups, accommodation for private functions, childcare and conference facilities and a one-stop-shop for Midlothian Council services; further recognises that the trust still requires &pound;1.38 million for the project to go ahead; hopes that this Big Lottery award will act as a catalyst in acquiring further funding, and wishes the trust all the very best in securing this funding toward an excellent community facility.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6500 Bill Wilson: Civil List Review</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Early Day Motion (EDM) 123, which states &quot;That this House is opposed to any increase in the Civil List while public spending is being cut and until Royal finances are subject to the same standards of accounting, auditing and reporting as all other public finances; and calls for an immediate freeze on Civil List payments and for an urgent and independent inquiry into Royal finances, with a view to reducing the overall cost of the Monarchy to well below the current estimated bill of &pound;100 million to &pound;200 million a year.&quot;, and thinks that such action is overdue.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6499 Annabel Goldie: Armed Forces Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Armed Forces Day, which is scheduled to take place on 26 June 2010 and will afford the public an opportunity to show their support for the country&rsquo;s servicemen and women, veterans and cadets; notes that events will be taking place all across Scotland; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s servicemen and women embody a selflessness, bravery and heroism at once remarkable and humble; asserts that Scotland&rsquo;s veterans, the guardians of the nation&rsquo;s freedom across the generations, are owed a debt that can never fully be repaid; further wishes Scotland&rsquo;s young cadets well in their training and admires their sense of duty; recognises the success of Armed Forces Day and hopes that it will continue to go from strength to strength, and encourages all Scots to participate in whatever way they can in this important celebration of courage and sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6498&diams;   James Kelly: Support for Sport in Scotland&rsquo;s Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the positive impact that sport can have on people right across Scotland&rsquo;s communities and the physical and mental wellbeing that it promotes; considers that the advent of the 2014 Commonwealth Games represents an excellent opportunity through sport to improve public health, contribute to Scotland&rsquo;s economy and help build strong communities; notes the contribution made to this process by the Scottish Sports Alliance, and welcomes the opportunity that such benefits have to grassroots sports organisations in communities such as Rutherglen and Cambuslang, which involve people of all ages in sport and encourage the values of team spirit and tolerance.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6497 Bill Wilson: Social Norms in Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the New South Wales Department of Education in Australia for employing a consultant to develop alcohol-focused educational resources/activities for teachers of secondary students with the aim of providing interesting and challenging educational activities regarding alcohol and alcohol use that go beyond the common risk and fact-based approaches, cut across different areas of the curriculum and assist students to question their taken-for-granted assumptions about others&rsquo; alcohol-related behaviours and attitudes; notes that the social norms approach to substance abuse has been proven to be highly effective in young people across the world and that the Australian project is likely to build on the successful European Drug Addiction Prevention Trial, a significant component of which is social norms-based, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider implementing similar projects in Scottish schools.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6496 Cathy Peattie: 40th Anniversary of the Equal Pay Act</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that it is now 40 years since the Equal Pay Act 1970 received royal assent yet the pay gap between men and women persists, with women in Scotland paid on average 12% less for full-time work and 32% less for part-time work and believes that the persistence of this pay gap is not only an issue of equality and social justice but also has a detrimentalimpact on theScottish economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6495 Linda Fabiani: The Waitrose Foundation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Waitrose Foundation on its fifth birthday and notes that, in its South Africa programme, &pound;2.7 million has been ploughed into South African farms, 162 projects are running at 33 different farms, more than 22,000 farm workers have benefited, 710 workers have trained in numeracy and literacy and 430 children receive organised child care in cr&egrave;ches; commends the foundation for its commitment to fair trade and the involvement of local communities, and looks forward to the foundation&rsquo;s future programme that links in with the South African Government&rsquo;s strategy of Black Economic Empowerment, supporting and enabling the participation of black South Africans as owners, managers, professionals and skilled employees in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6494 Trish Godman: National Thrombosis Week 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports National Thrombosis Week 2010, taking place between 1 and  5 June; congratulates Lifeblood: The Thrombosis Charity for campaigning to increase awareness of thrombosis, especially in the week when the charity will be visiting five UK cities, including Glasgow, in five days, educating both students and the public; is aware of the risk to hospital inpatients of contracting deep vein thrombosis; recognises that, according to a recent Lifeblood report, more than 20% of NHS boards have no policy in place to prevent hospital-acquired thrombosis and more than 25% of NHS boards do not provide formal education to their staff about assessing a patient&rsquo;s risk of developing the condition, and believes that the Scottish Government should follow the example set in England by mandating thrombosis prevention by putting in place outcome-focussed targets for the risk assessment of all hospital inpatients so as to effectively reduce the rates of death and suffering in hospital from this preventable condition.</p>
