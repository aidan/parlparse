<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3980</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Inverclyde Trio Receive Youth Football Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the significant contribution to youth football in Inverclyde of Jim McCallum, John Docherty and Maurie Oliver; notes that the hat trick of heroes have been honoured by Provost Michael McCormick at a recent reception celebrating their service to youth football in Inverclyde, and acknowledges that the trio has given almost 100 years of service to local football clubs, is continuing to contribute greatly to youth football at a local level and is an outstanding example of successful community involvement.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3979&diams; </strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Local Newspaper Week 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 11 to 17 May 2009 is Local Newspaper Week, which has the theme of building stronger communities, highlighting the important roles played by the 120-plus weekly, bi-weekly, paid-for and free newspapers that serve local people and businesses throughout Scotland&rsquo;s cities, towns and villages; acknowledges the local press as Scotland&rsquo;s most socially inclusive local mass communication medium; applauds the significant investment made by publishers to deliver to an increasingly digital agenda and increase their digital audience; notes that members of the Scottish Newspaper Publishers Association are facing the most severe crisis in revenue generation and profitability in living memory, attributable to the long-term decline in paid-for newspaper circulations, the emergence of advertising-dependent internet services and the loss of recruitment advertising and licensing revenue to initiatives such as myjobscotland, developed under the auspices of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Local Government National Shared Services Board and led by COSLA, and is extremely concerned about the collateral damage to the democratic process and to the local newspaper industry that would result from the proposed introduction of a publicly funded web portal for the publication of public information notices.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3978</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Dementia Awareness Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that Dementia Awareness Week 2009 takes place from 31 May to 7 June; is aware that Alzheimer Scotland estimates that in 2009 there are 67,000 people with dementia in Scotland, including 1,640 people under the age of 65; notes that this number is expected to rise to 114,000 by 2031; acknowledges that it is disappointing to note that Dementia Awareness Week follows a year in which a number of highly critical reports have highlighted the inefficiencies and failures in the quality of care of people with dementia in the community, in care homes and in long-term hospital care; notes the recent Care Commission report,<em> Better care, every step of the way</em>, which reflects the findings of 1,036 inspections and three investigations that found that 43% of homes did not realise that they were to deliver palliative and end-of-life care for people with life-limiting illnesses such as dementia; further notes the recent Care Commission report,<em> Gradings So Far</em>, which has shown significant variations in the quality of care received by elderly people in care homes when compared to other groups; considers that the poor quality of care at home services revealed in a recent Panorama investigation is simply unacceptable and particularly harmful to those people with dementia who may not be able to speak out for themselves; therefore supports the work of the Cross Party Group on Alzheimer&rsquo;s, which calls for a Charter of Rights for people with dementia; further welcomes the decision by Alzheimer Scotland, in supporting this initiative, to host a series of roadshows across Scotland in June 2009, starting in Irvine on Friday 5 June, to consult people with dementia, their carers and other stakeholders on the content of a Charter of Rights; notes that the Charter of Rights seeks to ensure that individuals and their families have a clear set of rights from diagnosis through to end of life, and therefore considers that a fundamental culture change in care services would help ensure the highest quality of service provision to people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3977</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Welcome to Age Concern and Help the Aged in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the merger of Age Concern Scotland and Help the Aged in Scotland; congratulates both organisations on joining forces to support older people by providing services and campaigning on the issues that impact on the lives of older people, and recognises the contribution that the merged organisation will make in supporting older people to meet the challenges of combating fuel poverty and securing high quality services, including appropriate personal care, transport and housing.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3976</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Glasgow City Council School Closure Decision</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates those who campaigned successfully for the retention of Ruchill Primary School; salutes the hard work and commitment of those who put forward the case for Wyndford, St Gregory&rsquo;s, St Agnes&rsquo;s and Our Lady of the Assumption primary schools; believes that the decision taken by Glasgow City Council on 23 April 2009 to close these schools is mistaken and fails to take adequate account of the social impact on the communities served by the schools and the effect of travel distances, the lengthening of the school day and the availability of and access to out-of-school activities, and hopes that every effort will be made by Glasgow City Council to mitigate the effects of this decision on the communities of Maryhill.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3974</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Retreat to Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the efforts of the Lodging House Mission and, in particular, wishes the organisation well for the Retreat on the Streets project, organised for Thursday 7 May 2009; recognises that the project, which invites Glasgow residents to spend the day in the city centre with nothing to do except reflect on their surroundings and the people with whom they share a city, spending only &pound;1.50 throughout the whole day, is likely to raise awareness of social inequalities within the city of Glasgow; praises the project for its encouragement of quiet contemplation within the boundaries of a busy city environment, and hopes that the Retreat on the Streets project will be a success and provide many people in Glasgow with the chance to view their city in a new light and maybe lead to spiritual enlightenment for some.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3973</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Get Ready for Glasgow Primary Youth Games 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the Glasgow Primary Youth Games 2009, taking place on 24 April 2009 in the Kelvin Hall, Argyle Street in Glasgow; highlights that this is the 13th year of the Games, which were established in 1996, are open to all schools in Glasgow and promote a variety of sports including athletics, judo, football and orienteering; welcomes the principal aims of the Games, which are to raise the profile of sport in Glasgow schools and provide young people with the opportunity to experience participation in a large-scale sporting event, and particularly appreciates the 2009 Games, in advance of the 2014 Commonwealth Games, for their contribution to raising the level of sports literacy among young people in Glasgow and their inclusive approach towards all young people in Glasgow.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3972</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Yeadon&rsquo;s of Elgin, Scotland&rsquo;s Independent Book Shop of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff and management of Yeadon&rsquo;s of Elgin bookshop on its being named the Scottish Independent Bookshop of the Year 2009; further congratulates all involved for its earning a place in the final shortlist of five for this year&rsquo;s British Book Industry Independent Bookshop of the Year award; notes that Yeadon&rsquo;s of Elgin is one of Scotland&rsquo;s oldest continuously trading bookshops and that it will begin publishing its own titles again this year, reviving a tradition that ran between the 1880s and 1940s, and finally wishes Yeadon&rsquo;s of Elgin the best of luck in securing its place as Britain&rsquo;s best independent bookshop at The Nibbies in Cambridge on 1 June.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3971</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Remember the Dead, Fight for the Living</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day on 28 April 2009, which has the theme, good occupational health for all workers; notes that International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day commemorates the two million workers who die from accidents and diseases at work, the 1.2 million who are injured and the 160 million who fall ill each year due to unsafe, unhealthy or unsustainable work and workplaces; notes that such deaths greatly exceed the number of deaths caused by war and that many such deaths are preventable by improved health and safety; calls for this day to be widely observed in Scotland through action to improve safety and provide a healthier working environment, and believes that the Scottish Government and others should formally recognise International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day as an annual event when they take stock and advance plans for health and safety improvements and seek to provide a healthier working environment in the year to come.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3970</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Major Benson-Blair</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament gives its support to Major Angus Benson-Blair of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards for his noble challenge to cycle 3,100 miles across America in under 12 days to raise $35,000 for the Army Benevolent Fund and the British Army Benevolent Fund America; notes that Major Benson-Blair, who has served twice in Iraq, will begin his endeavour on 17 June 2009 in California, on the west coast, and will finish at Maryland on the east coast; understands that to complete this gruelling task Major Benson-Blair will cycle 260 miles per day and that during his trans-continental charge he will gain over 100,000 vertical feet, the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest over three times; hopes that many individuals and organisations in Scotland, the rest of the United Kingdom and in the United States of America will show their support to Major Benson-Blair by visiting www.benson-blair.com, and commends him on his courageous quest to raise funding for these important charities.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3969#</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Partick Thistle Community Engagement Programme, Preparing for Glasgow 2014</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the Partick Thistle Football Club community engagement programme and recognises the value that this service provides to vulnerable and socially excluded groups in Glasgow; believes that football clubs have enormous potential for bringing together third sector organisations for the purposes of improving the nation&rsquo;s health and wellbeing and that, while health improvements can be inspired through the popular medium of football, individual clubs can also secure their long-term sustainability by increasing community participation; notes that community engagement and enhancing partnerships are two of the five core principles of the Scottish Government 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy plan, and considers that Partick Thistle&rsquo;s programme is a fine example of good practice in this area that supports efforts to steer the nation towards healthier living ahead of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3933#</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Private Residential Care Home Accountability</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the vital support for vulnerable elderly people provided through well managed care homes in Scotland; notes the increase in the number of privately managed and financed residential care homes in the Scottish Borders and further notes the role of the Care Commission in ensuring that all care homes in the public and private sector are delivering a high standard of care; also notes that financial mismanagement of private sector homes operations has caused worrying disruption in care but considers that there are very limited statutory powers for the Care Commission and local authorities to scrutinise the financial capability and security of private care homes operations, and believes that it would be beneficial for there to be more regular financial accountability as there is for the standard of care.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3930&diams; </strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Proposed Multi-fuel Power Station at Hunterston</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the application by Ayrshire Power Limited to the Scottish Government for permission, under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 and deemed consent under section 57 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997, to construct a multi-fuel power station at Hunterston Port, Fairlie in North Ayrshire; further notes that it is proposed that the facility would be fuelled by coal and potentially up to 15% biomass to produce up to 1,600MW of electricity per annum and would be carbon capture ready, which means that, while the facility would be designed to incorporate carbon capture and storage, it would not be installed until the technology had been shown to be technically and commercially viable, and considers that it would be beneficial if the power station operated carbon capture and storage from the outset or was able to meet an equivalent emissions performance standard by other means.</p>
