<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3849</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Antisocial Behaviour Framework</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of the new Antisocial Behaviour Framework, <em>Promoting Positive Outcomes: Working Together to Prevent Antisocial Behaviour in Scotland</em>, which has been developed in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) and other national partners; further notes that it builds on the success achieved since the Parliament introduced the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004; agrees that antisocial behaviour blights the quality of people&rsquo;s lives and should not be tolerated but believes that prevention is better than cure when it comes to protecting communities from disorder; values the cross-party and cross-organisational input and support that the framework has received; appreciates the wealth of good practice across Scotland and the importance of replicating it as widely as possible, and embraces the framework&rsquo;s commitment through enhanced prevention, integration, community engagement and communication to making our communities safer and stronger.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3848</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Hospital Waiting Times</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the most recent progress that has been made in reducing waiting times for patients; applauds the commitment, dedication and hard work of all NHS staff who have contributed to delivering these significant improvements for the people of Scotland; notes the progress made by the previous&nbsp;administration; acknowledges the substantial investment being made to increase NHSScotland capacity and the continuing work on integrating, modernising and redesigning services to speed access, diagnosis and treatment, and supports the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to deliver a maximum &quot;whole journey&quot; waiting time of 18 weeks by 2011.</p>
<p>Supported by: Shona Robison<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3847&diams; </strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Developing Telehealth in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the developing role of the Aberdeen-based Scottish Centre for Telehealth and the contribution that it can make to developing telehealth across Scotland; in particular considers that there has been significant investment in angiography facilities for coronary heart disease across Scotland, and considers that a national system of decision support for healthcare professionals would optimise coronary reperfusion for patients suffering an acute heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3846</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 be completed by 1 May 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3845</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that consideration of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 be extended to 1 May 2009.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3843</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following revision to the programme of business for Wednesday 1 April 2009&mdash;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3842</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Top Marks for Garnetbank Primary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils and staff of Garnetbank Primary School in Glasgow on raising over &pound;500 for Marie Curie&rsquo;s Big Build Appeal; notes that the Big Build Appeal aims to raise funds to build a replacement hospice offering state-of-the-art care for cancer patients, and looks forward to the opening of the new hospice scheduled for later this year<font color="#0000ff">.</font></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3841</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Daily Record and Sunday Mail Pension Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at developments at the <em>Daily Record</em> and <em>Sunday Mail</em>, where staff have voted overwhelming for strike action; is concerned that Trinity Mirror, following its decision to merge the two editorial desks, at the likely cost of 70 jobs, has decided not to use its discretion to enhance the pensions of those employees with over 25 years&rsquo; service, thereby making compulsory redundancies more likely; calls on management to reinstate this discretionary element in order to ensure that as many of the redundancies as possible are made on a voluntary basis, and further calls on management within the media and newspaper industry to consider the impact of job losses on the quality of journalistic output.</p>
<p>Supported by: James Kelly<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3840</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Prescription Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the reduction in prescription charges from 1 April 2009 to &pound;4 and to &pound;38 for a 12-month prescription pre-payment certificate, which will help all those who are struggling to pay for medicines through the current recession; notes that the abolition of prescription charges reflects the principles of our national health service, free at the point of use; considers that evidence shows that it is those with long-term conditions who have benefited the most from last year&rsquo;s prescription cuts, and finds it totally unacceptable that in the 21st century Scottish citizens should be taxed on ill health through prescription charges.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3839</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Supporting our Local Businesses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Government on the implementation of the second phase of the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which will see business rates abolished for up to 120,000 small businesses and a reduction for another 30,000; believes that small businesses are at the heart of thousands of communities across the country and it is vital that they are retained; considers the financial boost that this will give to small businesses, local high streets and the Scottish economy during this Downing Street downturn, and looks forward to the introduction of the Town Centre Regeneration Fund to further support Scotland&rsquo;s small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3838</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Drumchapel Table Tennis Club, Champions of Britain</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Drumchapel Table Tennis Club on winning the British League Premier Division title by defeating Ormesby 7-1 on Saturday 28 March 2009; thanks the club members who visited Holyrood prior to the recent Members&rsquo; Business debate celebrating the club&rsquo;s achievements, and wishes the club continued success in the years ahead.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3837</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>SNP Dundee City Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dundee City Council&rsquo;s new SNP administration; notes that, with 14 councillors, the SNP is the largest elected group on the council and, with the SNP administration, Dundee City Council will finally reflect the will of the electorate; also congratulates SNP Councillor Craig Melville whose recent victory in the Maryfield by-election, where the SNP increased its share of the vote to 48%, was instrumental in the transition of power; looks forward to a new era for Dundee, and welcomes the fact that, with an SNP administration, Dundee is now in a great state.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3830 *&diams; </strong>* <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Congratulating Glasgow Save Our Schools Campaigners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the parents, carers and children at the schools and nurseries proposed for closure under Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s schools modernisation strategy; praises their dedication and tireless campaigning against the proposed closures and their constructive participation in the consultation process that closed on 18 March 2009; notes that campaigners from diverse areas, cultures and backgrounds are successfully working together to make their concerns heard; recognises the invaluable lessons that the children have learned by taking part in the democratic process, and very much hopes that Glasgow&rsquo;s councillors and education officials reinforce these lessons by taking the concerns of the campaigners into account and that the *schools are saved*.</p>
<p>Supported by: Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-3811</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Dunfermline Building Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes reports about the future of the Dunfermline Building Society, possible losses and its exposure to the commercial property market; further notes that the Dunfermline has for 130 years been a solid and trusted mutual and is now Scotland&rsquo;s largest building society; expresses concern that building societies are being penalised by the increased capital requirement and funding formula for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and calls on the Scottish and UK governments to do everything in their power to keep the Dunfermline as a strong independent Scottish mutual.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3811.1</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Dunfermline Building Society</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3811) in the name of Jim Tolson, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert  &quot;welcomes the &pound;1.5 billion investment by the UK Government to plug the gap left by the recent financial mismanagement of the Dunfermline; additionally welcomes the news from the Secretary of State for Scotland, Jim Murphy MP, that he has been given assurances that there will be no compulsory redundancies at any branch over the next three years and calls on senior management at Nationwide to work with the respective staff associations to maximise employment opportunities in the new society; regrets that the former Dunfermline Building Society management did not respond to letters by local parliamentarians offering assistance, and looks forward to constructive engagement with the new management at the Nationwide Building Society.&quot;</p>
