            further staff resignations, attract suitably qualified consultants 
            to fill new and vacant posts, ensure temporary staff cover to avoid 
            a rationalisation of cancer services such as the cancellation of clinics, 
            and significantly shorten the timescale for the construction of the 
            new Beatson Oncology Centre at Gartnavel Hospital. </p>

            within Scottish prisons and further notes that morale amongst Scottish 
            Prison Service staff is at rock bottom as the result of (a) the deterioration

              the Executive's open approach in planning to consult on the Prison

              Fisheries</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive 
              to seek to negotiate an outcome from the Fisheries Council meeting 
              in December 2001 that reflects the need to preserve stocks for the 
              long term and represents the best achievable deal for the Scottish 
              fishing industry. </p>

              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S1M-2546.1</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Sea Fisheries</strong>-As 
                an amendment to motion (S1M-2546) in the name of Ross Finnie, 
                insert at end &quot;; further calls on the Executive to seek an 
                increase in nephrops quotas in line with scientific advice and 
                ensure that the outcome of all the negotiations recognises the 
                mixed character of Scotland's fisheries and takes into account 
                the many conservation measures already agreed by the industry; 
                further calls upon Ministers to retain an open mind with regard 
                to fisheries management measures proposed by the industry and 
                financially supported by the EU, and urges the Minister for Environment 
                and Rural Development to seek designation as lead UK Minister 
                on the EU Fisheries Council for the forthcoming negotiations on 
                quotas and the Common Fisheries Policy in order to secure the 
                best possible deal for the catching and processing sectors. </p>
              <p> <strong>S1M-2546.2</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor: Sea Fisheries</strong>-As 
                an amendment to motion (S1M-2546) in the name of Ross Finnie, 
                insert at end "; in particular calls on the Scottish Executive 
                to seek to overturn the proposed cuts in nephrops quotas in favour 
                of figures based on scientific advice; calls for a significant 
                cut in industrial fishing; notes that the change in net mesh sizes 
                will put an unfair burden on Scottish fishermen who fish both 
                EU and Norwegian waters, and further calls on the Executive to 
                press for retention of the internationally accepted 20-microgramme 
                testing system for scallops to promote the survival of the Scottish 
                scallop industry. </p>

            <p><strong>S1M-2400</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon:</strong> <strong>Proposed 
              Closure of Binny House, Sue Ryder Care</strong>-That the Parliament 
              condemns the unilateral and disgraceful decision by Sue Ryder Care 
              to close the Binny House care centre in Ecclesmachan, West Lothian; 
              considers that this shows a complete disregard for the interests 
              of the residents and staff of the centre; believes that by walking 
              away from very substantial offers of additional finance from health 
              boards and local authorities Sue Ryder Care has demonstrated bad 
              faith, and further believes that, unless this decision is reversed, 
              local authorities and the NHS should regard Sue Ryder Care as an 
              unsuitable partner for any future care projects. </p>
