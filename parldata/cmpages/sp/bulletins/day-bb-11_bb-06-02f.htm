<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any questions in relation to this section should be directed to the Chamber Desk, for which contact details are provided at the end of the Bulletin.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00172 Colin Beattie: Big Lottery Funding in Midlothian North and Musselburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Big Lottery Fund has granted &pound;83,674 in total to 10 projects in Midlothian North and Musselburgh in May 2011; notes that the Big Lottery Fund is investing in Scotland&rsquo;s communities through its small grant schemes, Awards for All, Community Wildlife and Investing in Ideas; further notes that Scotland Royal Marines Association, Duo Gymnastics Club, The Fisherrow Trust, Dalkieth Gymnastics Club, Bright Sparks Playgroup, Dadswork, Midlothian FEI Cluster Group, Midlothian After School Clubs, Bonnyrigg After School Club and Melville Housing Association Limited are among the projects to benefit from Big Lottery Funding; considers that this funding will be a welcome enhancement to all these projects, and wishes them every success in the future.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00168.2 Liz Smith: Contribution of Sport to Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00168 in the name of Shona Robison (Contribution of Sport to Scotland), leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;and recognises that far more priority must be given to increasing and improving physical education in primary and secondary schools, to delivering opportunities in outdoor education for all pupils and to improving grassroots support in clubs and schools and community access to sporting facilities across the country.&quot;</p>
