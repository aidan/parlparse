          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1236</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Europe Day - 9 May 2004</strong>-That the Parliament is proud to mark Europe Day as a celebration of the founding of the European Union (EU); endorses the fundamental principles of the EU as set out in the declaration by Robert Schumann on 9 May 1950; welcomes the contribution that the EU has made towards peace and solidarity across Europe; agrees that enlargement on 1 May 2004 represents a historic moment in our European history; acknowledges that the principles on which the EU was originally founded are now more important than ever; extends the hand of friendship to the 10 accession states, and encourages the people of Scotland to join the citizens of Europe in the celebration of our common values on Europe Day.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1235#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan McNeil:</strong> <strong>Space Invaders</strong>-That the Parliament notes the difficulties experienced by people within local communities who have secured disabled parking spaces outside their homes; deplores the fact that these spaces can become a focus of conflict within communities where people seek to use such a space, despite not having a disabled parking badge; notes with equal dismay the figures published by the Baywatch campaign group that show that over 20% of disabled parking bays in supermarket car parks are being used by non-disabled drivers; recognises that the current legal position, which distinguishes between courtesy parking spaces and those supported by traffic regulation orders, creates problems for people with disabilities who need to rely on a designated parking space outside their home; appreciates, in the case of car parks on private land such as those belonging to supermarkets, the frustration of disabled drivers where the store management appears reluctant to enforce its own parking policy; acknowledges that, for their part, some store managers are not clear about their powers to compel drivers to move from specially designated bays; notes that this situation leaves supermarkets vulnerable to future legal action under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended); therefore believes that the Scottish Executive, local authorities and all relevant agencies should work together to develop an awareness campaign to highlight the rights of disabled people and to emphasise the unacceptability of harassing those who have been allocated disabled parking spaces, and considers that, if a satisfactory solution cannot be found, the possibility of legislating to address the problem and giving local authorities the appropriate enforcement powers should be examined.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong>, Scott Barrie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1234#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Expansion of Services Provided by the Food Train</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Food Train on the expansion of its operations delivering groceries to elderly and disabled people throughout Dumfries and Galloway; further congratulates the Food Train on the introduction of its services in Dalkeith, Midlothian, and looks forward to similar services being established throughout Scotland.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1233</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Borders Cancerline for Welfare Benefits Advice</strong>-That the Parliament applauds the work of Borders Cancerline for Welfare Benefits Advice, a partnership between Macmillan Cancer Relief and the Disablement Income Group Scotland, which commenced at the beginning of April and provides a dedicated telephone helpline for those affected by cancer and their carers in the Borders, giving access to professionally trained staff with an understanding of cancer, its treatments and effects, a personal adviser to provide support and guidance through the complex process of claiming relevant benefits and help in completing claim forms by phone, and urges the Scottish Executive to support all similar projects which can have only positive benefits, both emotional and financial, for people at a very vulnerable time in their lives.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1232</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Draft Health Professions (Operating Department Practitioners and Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2004</strong>-That the Health Committee recommends that the draft Health Professions (Operating Department Practitioners and Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2004 be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1231</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2004 Amendment Order 2004</strong>-That the Finance Committee recommends that the draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2004 Amendment Order 2004 be approved.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1230</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Latin American Plantation Bananas</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that use of pesticides, including paraquat, on plantation bananas in Latin America is more than 20 times greater than average pesticide use on crops in industrialised countries with corresponding levels of worker exposure to pesticides and illnesses; further notes the lack of compliance with international labour standards, including the right to unionise and the right to safety protection for workers, in these Latin American countries, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to put pressure on the World Trade Organisation to force countries growing plantation bananas to reduce pesticides usage and improve workers' rights as a matter of urgency.</P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1229#</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Competitive School Sport</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Johnstone High School and the Nicholson Institute for being finalists in the 101st Bank of Scotland Senior Shield Final; applauds the commitment and determination they showed in reaching the final; recognises the importance of having young sportsmen and women competing at the highest possible levels of competition, given the current state of many of our major sports, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that school sport is made a priority so that children are able to enjoy competitive sport at the highest levels and that more time is given in the curriculum to sport in general in Scotland's schools.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1228</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Business in Parliament Conference</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the wide range of business interests represented at the Business in Parliament conference on 23 April 2004; thanks those who participated for their attendance; congratulates the Scottish business community on its commitment to delivering a smart, successful Scotland; accepts that the economy of Scotland can only grow if the Scottish Executive adopts the correct policies to help business and acknowledges that the development of a well-educated and skilled workforce is essential to give business the tools it needs for success; notes that the evidence from the most recent Bank of Scotland Labour Market Report shows that the Scottish labour market saw its strongest growth in March 2004 since data was first collected in January 2003; urges the Executive to continue the dialogue with business begun by this event; calls on ministers to work with the Enterprise and Culture Committee to devise the best way to develop the relationship started by this event, and welcomes the Executive's commitment to debate the outcomes of the Business in Parliament conference before the whole Parliament.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Margaret Jamieson<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong>, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenneth Macintosh<strong>*</strong>, Dr Elaine Murray<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Bristow Muldoon<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Mr Alasdair Morrison<strong>*</strong>, Cathy Peattie<strong>*</strong>, Dr Sylvia Jackson<strong>*</strong>, George Lyon<strong>*</strong>, Karen Gillon<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-1227</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Unseen</strong>-That the Parliament notes the report by the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB), <em>Unseen - Neglect, isolation and household poverty amongst older people with sight loss,</em> of March 2004; notes that nine out of 10 blind and partially-sighted people are aged 60 and over and that the recurring theme in the survey is that people in older age groups were poorer and less likely to have received services designed to help them live independently and safely and, in particular, that in the area of support and care only 48% have received a home assessment, only 32% were aware of mobility training and only 46% of the social services rehabilitation service; notes that only 37% had been offered a cooker sticker and 47% a liquid level indicator; notes that 74% have an income below &pound;195 per week with only 20% aware of extra expenses available for sight loss, and therefore supports the RNIB's recommendations that every person with sight loss is offered an assessment of needs, suitable services and suitable tools so that they can live independently and with dignity, that attendance allowance should be automatically available to all registered blind and partially-sighted people and that Her Majesty's Government should issue benefit take-up targets and fund advocacy for take-up projects as part of a drive to ensure that benefits reach all entitled to them.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1226</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Independent Clinical Research Trials</strong>-That the Parliament notes the recent report published by the Scottish Association for Mental Health, <em>All you need to know? Scottish Survey of People's Experience of Psychiatric Drugs</em>, which highlights the serious concerns of service users regarding unwanted side effects from their prescribed medication such as anti-depressants and endorses the recommendation that the government establishes an independent body to perform clinical trials.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-1199*#*</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Closure of the Queen Mother's Hospital</strong>-That the Parliament regrets Greater Glasgow NHS Board's decision of 20 April 2004 to close the Queen Mother's Hospital in Glasgow; notes that the Queen Mother's Hospital is an integral part of the Yorkhill campus model of care, deliberately co-locating specialist maternity and paediatric care and attracting world class medical and surgical expertise; further notes the proven record of excellence at Yorkhill in the development of ultrasound, innovative foetal therapy and developing a breast milk bank; believes that this service model has benefited women with difficulties in their pregnancies, sick babies and families throughout Scotland as well as providing an important general maternity service for the north west Glasgow corridor and that the hospital has been the hospital of choice for many more women in the west of Scotland for over 40 years; believes that the quality of specialist baby and maternal care services is threatened by this decision as reconfiguration may prove costly and difficult to implement; is concerned that the board has taken this decision in the face of overwhelming clinical, political and public opposition; believes that the decision was reached unfairly using inaccurate assumptions and that no other option was seriously considered, and considers that the Minister for Health and Community Care must (a) take steps to restore public confidence in consultation and decision-making processes in the NHS, (b) thoroughly review all of the factors that led to the Greater Glasgow NHS Board's decision on maternity services, (c) reject the decision to close the Queen Mother's hospital and (d) ensure that the integrated specialist care model is protected to continue to serve Scotland with the same quality of service and innovation that has been achieved over the last 40 years.</P>
