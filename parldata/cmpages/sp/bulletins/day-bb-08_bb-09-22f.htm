<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2576</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Dungavel and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the UK Government&rsquo;s opting-in to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the fact that this will mean the end of the practice of incarcerating asylum seeker children and child migrants without judicial scrutiny; further welcomes the fact that Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre will no longer hold children in close proximity to potentially dangerous adults; encourages the UK Government and the National Asylum Support Service to implement the convention now instead of waiting until domestic legislation is aligned with the convention, and congratulates all those who have campaigned to end child detention at Dungavel on the success of their campaign at last.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2575</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>FSA Ban on Short Selling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to suspend the practice of short selling by traders in the financial markets; believes, however, that this practice should be banned on a permanent basis and that the temporary ban will not resolve the damage that the practice does to the viability of financially-sound companies, and is firmly of the view that both the FSA and Westminster Government should extend the ban permanently.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2574</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Meningitis Research Foundation&rsquo;s Awareness Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Meningitis Research Foundation&rsquo;s Awareness Week between 15 and 21 September 2008; notes that meningitis is a disease that infects 12 people every fortnight in Scotland, of whom one will die and two more will suffer life-altering after-effects, such as brain damage, deafness and multiple amputations;&nbsp;further notes that babies and children are most at risk and that more young lives can be saved through raising awareness among clinical practitioners and the public of the early warning signs; encourages continued support for the Scottish meningitis working group to improve awareness of the disease; also notes that continued efforts are needed to improve the uptake of primary vaccinations against invasive diseases, particularly pneumococcal disease, and urges continued support for aftercare, as well as continued support for further research to eradicate meningitis and septicaemia.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2573</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>BBC Alba Launch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of BBC Alba, the world&rsquo;s first Scottish Gaelic language television channel; congratulates all those involved in the creation of this channel and the recent exciting expansion of the Gaelic broadcasting industry; notes that this service has been long awaited by many in the Gaelic community; believes that this new channel is one more step towards the continued survival of the Gaelic language, and wishes the channel every success for the future.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-2557</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>The Late Dr Alan F Phillips</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the passing away of Dr Alan F Phillips, who dedicated much of his life work to the elimination of nuclear weapons as a result of his involvement in the early development of radar during World War Two, leading to him becoming a leader in the field of radiation therapy and clinical radiotherapy, which in turn allowed him to gain an intimate understanding of the secrets of the atom that imbued him with a unique moral imperative to work for nuclear weapons elimination, and hopes that his passion and dedication to nuclear disarmament will serve as a shining example to all those seeking the same.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-2548</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Loss of Arctic Ice - Global Climate Concern</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic is continuing its alarming downward trend with possibly less ice in this year than in any other year since monitoring began; understands that the continuing loss of older, thicker ice means that the Arctic ice cover has become dramatically younger and thinner this year; also understands that the area of ice that is at least five years old has decreased by 56% between 1985 and 2007; recognises that these changes are affecting the indigenous peoples of the Arctic whose traditional livelihoods depend on healthy ecosystems and that there are signs that species such as polar bears are in peril as climate change erodes the ice platform on which they rely; is concerned that the reduction in sea ice has wider implications for global climate change, as the Arctic ice is like a mirror reflecting the sun&rsquo;s heat back into space and, as the ice goes, Arctic waters absorb more heat, further adding to global warming; also recognises that this warming will release more greenhouse gases from the Arctic previously locked in permanently frozen ground; considers that the trend of melting Arctic sea ice is also alarming for the rest of the world as the Arctic is key in stabilising the global climate, and therefore believes that we must heed the implications of this loss of Arctic ice cover and take immediate action to reduce emissions by acting now and demonstrating clear leadership on tackling climate change.</p>
