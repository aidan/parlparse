          <p><strong>*S2M-576#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Proposed 
            Closure of Queen Mother's Hospital, Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the potential impact of the proposed closure of the Queen 
            Mother's Hospital on maternity services provision in the Greater Glasgow 
            area; notes with concern reports that suggest that the hospital's 
            Breastfeeding Support Unit may be forced to close its breast milk 
            bank as a result of such a move; acknowledges that the support unit 
            has frequently been recognised as an example of best practice within 
            this field, and considers that action should be taken to ensure that 
            such a vital service is in no way jeopardised by the proposed changes 
            to maternity services.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-575</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Aung 
            San Sui Kyi</strong>-That the Parliament notes with great concern 
            the continued detention of Aung San Sui Kyi, head of the National 
            League for Democracy in Burma; further notes with dismay the continued 
            refusal of the military junta of Burma to recognise the result of 
            the 1990 elections where the National League for Democracy won more 
            than 80% of the vote; condemns the house arrest and continued detention 
            of Aung San Sui Kyi; applauds the Nobel Peace Prize winner and salutes 
            her determination in her continued struggle for democracy in Burma, 
            and encourages the City of Edinburgh Council to grant the Freedom 
            of the City to Aung San Sui Kyi to send a message of solidarity to 
            all those who work for freedom in Burma.</P>

            Opera's Financial Situation</strong>-That the Parliament expresses 
            its concern at the financial crisis facing Scottish Opera; acknowledges 
            the great critical and artistic standard the company has achieved 
            recently, particularly with the production of Wagner's Ring cycle; 
            understands the complexity and expense of staging high quality music 
            drama but believes that Scotland should be able to fund an international 
            standard opera company; notes that Scottish Opera has had a four-year 
            standstill in its funding, and calls on the Scottish Executive to 
            ensure that the current financial crisis at Scottish Opera is solved, 
            both by making sure that the company rigorously examines its expenditure 
            and working practices in line with other major arts bodies and by 
            establishing a four-year funding plan that will give Scottish Opera 
            the guarantees required to continue to excel in the future.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-573</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Quality 
            of Services for Young Offenders</strong>-That the Parliament recommends 
            that the Scottish Executive should review whether current monitoring 
            arrangements provide sufficient information about the quality and 
            quantity of services for children on supervision, in particular the 
            extent to which councils are meeting statutory requirements and providing 
            the services prescribed by Children's Hearings.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-572</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Football Writers' Association</strong>-That the Parliament deeply 
            regrets the decision of the Scottish Football Writers' Association 
            to exclude women from membership of the association; further regrets 
            their decision to exclude women as guests at their annual dinner, 
            and calls on all football clubs and players in Scotland to put pressure 
            on the association until it recognises that there is no place for 
            gender discrimination in a 21st century Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-571</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Visit 
            of George W Bush</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the visit of 
            George W Bush to the United Kingdom and supports peaceful mass protests 
            in Edinburgh and Glasgow on 19 November 2003 against his visit.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-570#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Abuse 
            of Older People</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that around 
            one in ten older people in Scotland have been victims of various forms 
            of elder abuse; congratulates Age Concern Scotland's elder abuse project 
            on its work in attempting to raise awareness of this problem and, 
            in particular, supports its interactive forum theatre events, which 
            will lead to breaking the silence on elder abuse in our communities; 
            hopes that this unique approach to tackling the very sensitive subject 
            of the abuse of older people will lead to its greater recognition, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should take action to reduce 
            the level of elder abuse and to ensure that victims of abuse have 
            access to appropriate support and legal remedies.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-569#</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Economic 
            Potential of the Renewable Energy Industry</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the outstanding economic potential presented by the renewable 
            energy industry, not only in the field of wind power but also through 
            other forms of energy such as biomass and wave power and further recognises 
            that, if the Scottish Executive is to meet all of its renewable energy 
            targets, it needs to do all it can to encourage all forms of renewable 
            energy so that the market is there to support future projects.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Bill Butler</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-568</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>A80 
            Appraisal</strong>-That the Parliament believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should undertake a full appraisal of the costs and benefits 
            of both the A80 upgrade and the alternative Kelvin Valley route for 
            a new motorway, including a comparison between the economic and environmental 
            impacts of both options, and recognises the importance to the Scottish 
            economy of making a timeous decision.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-567</strong> <strong>Mr Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Gar-Ling 
            Ng</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Gar-Ling Ng, a student

            Enterprise Programme Awards 2003 as a result of her new design idea 
            for an oil pipeline cleaner.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-566</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Draft 
            Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 Amendment (Scotland) Order 2003</strong>-That 
            the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the draft Proceeds of Crime 
            Act 2002 Amendment (Scotland) Order 2003 be approved.</P>

            Oxgangs to Africa Housing Initiative</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes plans initiated by community leader Mr Jackie Laird and the 
            people of Oxgangs in Edinburgh to transport fixtures and fittings 
            from three, soon to be demolished, tower blocks in the area to Nigeria 
            and Sierra Leone where they will be used to build villages for orphans 
            and offers its full support to this initiative hoping that it helps 
            to further greater understanding, solidarity and co-operation between 
            African and Scottish peoples.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Alex Neil, Bill Butler</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-564#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>World 
            AIDS Day 2003</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the importance 
            of World AIDS Day, 1 December 2003, both for Scotland and for all 
            those nations and peoples most affected by the spread of HIV/AIDS; 
            notes the need to combat HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination 
            which is highlighted by this year's theme, &quot;Do you have time?&quot;; 
            further notes that there are now over 42 million people living with 
            HIV/AIDS, including 50,000 people in the UK and nearly 4,000 people 
            in Scotland; recognises that women account for half of those infected 
            with HIV/AIDS and there are more than 13.2 million AIDS orphans; notes 
            the importance of practical assistance for the poorer countries devastated

            Development in Education</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges 
            the importance of promoting and developing education for sustainable 
            development; commends Education 21, a joint forum, including educationalists, 
            non-government organisations, businesses, local authorities, agencies 
            and trade unions, promoting education consistent with a sustainable 
            future, on its partnership approach to driving forward this agenda; 
            welcomes initiatives such as Eco-Schools, the Sustainable Secondary 
            Schools Partnership project and the news that the Scottish Executive 
            will be supporting the Inverclyde pilot on an enterprising global 
            citizen course, and looks towards a significant Scottish contribution

            Development of Renewable Energy</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            Scotland's massive renewable energy potential; recognises the genuine 
            concerns of local communities about the proliferation of wind farm 
            planning applications; believes that the Scottish Executive must ensure 
            that the potential benefits to the long-term sustainability of our 
            remote and rural communities from community and crofting-owned renewable 
            energy developments are realised, and therefore calls on the Executive 
            to support Highlands and Islands Enterprise in their efforts to develop 
            a Highlands and Islands community energy company to support communities 
            in developing their own wind turbines and other renewable energy projects.</P>

            European Union to drop its plans for compulsory daytime headlight 
            use for all road users; believes that such plans are not in the best 
            safety interests of vulnerable road users such as cyclists and motorcyclists, 
            and further believes that this measure would lead to an increase in

            affected with MS; recognises that in the last four years progress 
            has been made in the provision of services to people with MS, but 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should develop for people with 
            MS a standard that will ensure that the level of treatment, support 
            and care will be the same regardless of where in Scotland they live.</P>

            of UK seats in the European Parliament from 87 to 78 to accommodate 
            enlargement of the EU; welcomes the accession of 10 new countries 
            in 2004; believes, however, that Scotland, with no seat on the Council 
            of Europe, no Commissioners and fewer MEPs than comparably-sized independent 
            member states, has little enough influence in the EU, and therefore 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should resist the reduction in

            building of a second Forth road bridge would do nothing to solve the 
            problems of increasing traffic congestion in Fife and Lothian and 
            further believes that these problems could be tackled through a range 
            of other measures including rail infrastructure improvements, starting 
            with an upgrade of the inadequate signalling system of the Forth Rail 
            Bridge and, in the longer term, a reopening of the rail line from 
            Dunfermline to Alloa to alleviate freight congestion on the central

            to Terrestrial TV Channels in Rural Areas</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that residents in parts of the Highlands and Islands do not 
            receive independent terrestrial TV channels unless they purchase an 
            encryption card from BSkyB on a regular basis; further notes with 
            concern that access to terrestrial channels in those communities with 
            analogue relay systems will be removed when the analogue signal is 
            switched off in 2010; believes that TV license payers should not have 
            to pay more because of their geographical location, and considers 
            that Her Majesty's Government should take action to ensure that all 
            UK TV license payers have unrestricted access to terrestrial TV channels.</P>
