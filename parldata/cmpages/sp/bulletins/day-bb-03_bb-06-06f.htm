          <p><strong>*S2M-115#</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner: National Beds 
            Inquiry</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that the number of 
            NHS beds has been reduced by over 5,000 since the mid-1990s and that 
            this policy continues today as shown in the Greater Glasgow NHS Board 
            area where the number of acute beds may be reduced by 11% from 2001 
            to 2005 despite the number of acute admissions increasing; is concerned 
            at the result of this reduction which will mean that patients will 
            have to wait on trolleys until a bed becomes available, sometimes 
            for up to eight hours or longer; believes that this delay exposes 
            patients, who may be lying in a public place on uncomfortable and 
            inappropriate mattresses, to an increased risk of infection with people 
            passing through and also imposes unnecessary additional demands on 
            nursing staff who have to provide food and water to these patients 
            as well as provide treatment to them, such as frequent turning to 
            prevent pressure points and venous stasis, a pre-cursor to deep venous 
            thrombosis, as a result of the patient being kept in a restricted 
            position for long periods; believes that, rather than increasing the 
            number of hospital trolleys for patients to lie on in busy corridors, 
            the number of acute hospital beds must be increased urgently in order 
            to offer a safe and comfortable bed in the appropriate ward with the 
            appropriate nursing and medical care that each patient requires which 
            would also free up accident and emergency departments to carry on 
            with the treatment of other patients; further believes that beds are 
            important in maintaining effective medical and surgical provision 
            for day or short-stay patients, and therefore considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should institute a national beds inquiry to establish how 
            many beds within each speciality are available, and are required, 
            so that emergency admissions are afforded the proper level of care 
            and elective work can be accommodated within the bed capacity in order 
            to allow waiting times and lists to be reduced.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-114</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Wear Red for Heart 
            Day, Friday 13 June 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports 
            the British Heart Foundation&#146;s &quot;Wear Red for Heart Day&quot; 
            as part of Heart Week 2003 from 7 to 15 June 2003, supports the work 
            of the foundation in its fight against heart and circulatory disease, 
            and urges politicians and others to support &quot;Wear Red for Heart 
            Day&quot; to raise funds for children who need special care. </p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-113</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: Amicus Scottish 
            Cup Final</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Hibernian 
            Ladies Football Club on its success in the Amicus Scottish Cup Final, 
            completing a day of women&#146;s and girls&#146; football at Almondvale 
            Stadium; notes that women&#146;s and girls&#146; football is one of 
            the fastest growing sports in the world; urges the development of 
            links between schools and local clubs to provide new opportunities 
            at every level of the game in Scotland, and welcomes the involvement 
            of Amicus in supporting equality in sport as well as in the workplace.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-112#</strong> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Stranraer to Cairnryan 
            Rail Link</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the proposal of 
            P&amp;O and Stena Line to operate a joint port at Cairnryan from which 
            the premier British ferry crossings to Northern Ireland will operate; 
            further notes that, following the implementation of this proposal, 
            there will be no sailings from, or to, the port of Stranraer, and 
            therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should examine the 
            possibilities of restoring the rail link between Stranraer and Cairnryan 
            for the benefit of both public and freight transport alike and the 
            relief of the already fragile roads infrastructure in that region.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-111</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Inaugural 
            Scots Traditional Music Awards</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
            the inaugural Scots Traditional Music Awards which will take place 
            on 13 September 2003; notes the high calibre of nominations across 
            all 15 categories; is confident that the existence of these awards 
            will highlight the extent and diversity of Scottish traditional music, 
            song, dance and languages, and looks forward to traditional music 
            gaining a more prominent profile in the future cultural life of Scotland.</p>
