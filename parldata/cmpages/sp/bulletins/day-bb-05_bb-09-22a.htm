          <p align="center"><strong>            Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
          <p>            <strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary  Bureau Motions</p>
          <p>            <em>followed  by</em> Scottish  Green Party Debate: Economic Policy&mdash;</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>S2M-3321 Mark Ballard: Economic Policy&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that the top priority of  the Scottish Executive, as stated in the current Partnership Agreement, is  &ldquo;growing the economy&rdquo; but reminds the Executive that GDP, its preferred measure  of economic growth, makes no distinction between beneficial and harmful  economic activity, ignores many socially beneficial and highly desirable  practices and treats the depletion of natural capital as income and is  therefore a very poor indicator of economic development; agrees with the Labour  Party Policy Commission on the Environment that &ldquo;For too long, economic and  political success has been measured solely in terms of the rate of growth of  economic activity&rdquo;; considers, therefore, that if Scotland is to enjoy economic  development that does not compromise social justice and environmental  sustainability it needs a more meaningful yardstick than simply measuring the  monetary value of goods and services produced in Scotland; remains committed to  assisting the positive economic development of a healthy Scottish economy and  considers that placing sustainability and national well-being at the heart of  Executive policy will ultimately lead to a stronger, healthier and more  innovative economic future for the people of Scotland, and urges the Executive  to consider alternatives to GDP with a view to adopting a more suitable measure  of national progress as its top priority. <br />
              The  Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p>            <strong>S2M-3321.4 Allan Wilson: Economic Policy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3321)  in the name of Mark Ballard, leave out from &ldquo;notes&rdquo; to end, and insert  &ldquo;supports growing the economy as the top priority of the Scottish Executive;  believes that economic growth must be sustainable; agrees with the Partnership  Agreement commitment to assess economic development policies against their  impact on sustainable development indicators; notes that Framework for Economic Development in  Scotland has made sustainable development the principal objective;  welcomes the stronger emphasis on sustainability in the refresh of A Smart Successful Scotland; endorses  the Executive&rsquo;s determination to drive forward its green jobs strategy, and  endorses the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to sustainable development.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>            <strong>S2M-3321.1 Jim Mather: Economic Policy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3321)  in the name of Mark Ballard, insert at end &ldquo;as a pre-requisite for a new era in  which, no matter how national wealth is measured, the Scottish Parliament  should have legislative responsibility for the management of all our natural  resources.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>            <strong>S2M-3321.2 Murdo Fraser: Economic Policy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3321)  in the name of Mark Ballard, leave out from first &quot;GDP&quot; to end and  insert &ldquo;the Scottish economy actually experienced zero growth in the first  quarter of this year; believes that GDP growth is an extremely important  measurement of quality of life because a strong economy is crucial to providing  individual financial security and the necessary investment for quality public  services; further believes that the Executive&rsquo;s stewardship of the economy has  been detrimental to the quality of life of many Scots; notes that Scotland fell  four places in the UK Regional Competitiveness Index between 1997 and 2005, and  therefore calls on the Executive to take concrete action to reverse our  economic under-performance by cutting red tape, privatising Scottish Water,  increasing investment in roads and public transport and specifying a date for  the proposed cut in business rates.&rdquo; </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>            <em>followed  by</em> Scottish Green Party Debate: Children of Asylum Seekers&mdash;</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>            S2M-3323 Patrick Harvie: <strong>Children of Asylum Seekers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the  trauma experienced by the children of asylum seekers when families are removed  for deportation and the impact this has on school communities; believes that  practices such as those reportedly used against the Vucaj family in Glasgow,  including dawn raids, handcuffing of children and the removal of children by  large groups of officers in uniform and body armour, are unnecessary and cause  fear and distress to the children concerned; affirms its support for the  principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) which states  that governments should protect children from all forms of physical or mental  violence; recognises that, while the Scottish Executive has no direct  responsibility for the operation of the asylum and immigration system, it is  responsible for the welfare of children, for schools and for working with the  UK Government to report on compliance with the UNCRC; commends the First  Minister for his aspiration &ldquo;to ensure that no child is left behind or held  back&rdquo;, and calls on him to give the greatest possible urgency to realising that  aspiration for the most vulnerable children in Scotland who include those  facing detention and removal.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>              The  Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p>            <strong>S2M-3323.2 Peter Peacock: Children of Asylum Seekers&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3323)  in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &ldquo;believes&rdquo; to end, and insert  &ldquo;affirms its support for the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of  the Child (UNCRC) which states that governments should protect children from  all forms of physical or mental violence; recognises that, while the Scottish  Executive has no direct responsibility for the operation of the immigration and  asylum system, it is responsible for the welfare of children, for schools, and  for working with the UK Government to report on compliance with the UNCRC;  commends the substantial work done in Scotland to ensure the effective  education and inclusion of the children of asylum seekers; believes that, in  the vast majority of cases, failed asylum seeker families do not pose either a  security threat or a serious risk of flight; calls on Scottish ministers to  give the greatest possible urgency to realising their aspirations for the most  vulnerable children in Scotland, including those facing detention and removal,  and urges them to continue discussions with the Home Office with a view to  agreement that the Home Office will work closely with services for children and  young people before the removal of any family and to convey to the Home Office  the widespread concerns about practices such as so-called &ldquo;dawn raids&rdquo;,  handcuffing of children, and the removal of children by large groups of  officers in uniform and body armour.&rdquo; </p>
              <p>            <strong>S2M-3323.1 Christine Grahame: Children of Asylum Seekers&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3323)  in the name of Patrick Harvie, insert at end &ldquo;and, separately, calls on the  UK Government to give due regard to the different child protection measures in Scotland, in  particular the remit of the Commissioner for Children and Young People and the  jurisdiction of the Reporter to the Children&rsquo;s Panel.&rdquo; </p>
