          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1727</strong> <strong>Robert Brown on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body:</strong> <strong>Holyrood Inquiry Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament thanks the Rt Hon Lord Fraser of Carmyllie QC for his report of the Holyrood Inquiry and invites the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Scottish Executive to consider the contents of the report.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1726</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Delay in Tenant Farmers&rsquo; Right to Buy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the delays to the implementation of Parts 2 and 6 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 that will give a pre-emptive right to buy to tenant farmers; is further concerned that this delay is allowing landowners to rush through sales of agricultural land in order to evade the will of the Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Executive to give a high priority to its consideration of the responses to the current consultation on the implementation of this measure so that tenants&rsquo; right to buy can be implemented without further delay.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1725#</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon:</strong> <strong>St John&rsquo;s Hospital in Livingston</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that it is not in the best interests of the people of Lothian that, with effect from 27 September 2004, NHS Lothian intends to remove emergency and major general surgery from St John&rsquo;s Hospital, in spite of it being a modern hospital with an excellent clinical record and a recently-expanded accident and emergency department; further believes that it is outrageous that NHS Lothian made a decision to remove this service and trauma orthopaedic surgery without full public consultation or ministerial approval, and considers that the Minister for Health and Community Care should urgently intervene and require that the emergency surgical services are properly resourced to sustain the services at St John&rsquo;s.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1724</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Beautiful Scotland in Bloom Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Alness in Bloom team for winning the much-coveted top prize in this year&rsquo;s Beautiful Scotland in Bloom Awards; notes that this is the fourth time that Alness has taken the Rosebowl Trophy, having previously won the honours in 1997, 1998 and 2000; further notes that Alness, Ross-shire, has also won the Horticultural Award which is presented for the community that stages the best show of planters and hanging baskets in Scotland; pays tribute to the hard work and enthusiasm of the whole team involved, and wishes Alness every success for the results of the Beautiful Britain in Bloom competition that will be announced in Leeds this week.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1723#</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Development of Edinburgh Airport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the importance of Edinburgh Airport to the local, regional and national economy; further notes projections in Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government&rsquo;s white paper, <em>The Future of Air Transport</em>, that Edinburgh Airport will need a second runway by 2020; is sceptical that these projected passenger number increases will necessarily come to pass; recognises that, while setting aside land for any second runway may be a sensible precaution, it creates planning blight for a number of households and concern for many others and that construction would necessitate relocation of the Royal Highland showground; believes BAA plc must engage with all the local communities around the airport and keep them up to date with development plans at the airport in as open and transparent a fashion as possible; recognises the problem of noise pollution from current flight levels; believes that greater provision of high-speed rail could offer genuine alternatives to short-haul air travel, with the added benefit of freeing up capacity for more long-haul international flights and reducing the need for a second runway; welcomes the development of tram and rail links to Edinburgh Airport and the development of all transport links that will reduce congestion in the area, and considers that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government, the Scottish Executive, BAA plc and all concerned should help deliver sustainable, long-term development of Edinburgh Airport.</p>
