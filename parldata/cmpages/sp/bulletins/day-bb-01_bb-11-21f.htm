          <p><strong>*S1M-2468#</strong> <strong> Alasdair Morgan: North Channel 
            Ferry Crossing</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with regret that 
            Stena Line is to withdraw one ferry from the Stranraer to Belfast 
            route resulting in 92 job losses; welcomes, however, the feasibility 
            study being undertaken by Stena Line into creating new port facilities 
            in Loch Ryan and at Belfast with a view to decreasing crossing times 
            and increasing the daily number of sailings; recognises the importance 
            of the North Channel ferry traffic to the economy of Wigtownshire, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should come forward with 
            plans to upgrade the road infrastructure leading to the Loch Ryan 
            ports in a way which will complement the investment undertaken by 
            P &amp; O and Stena Line ferry companies.</p>
