<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7895 Marilyn Livingstone: Congratulations to Kinghorn Lifeboat Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Kinghorn lifeboat station was the second busiest station in Scotland last year, with the boat being launched on 70 occasions, including 25 call-outs in the dark, and rescuing 92 people; understands that the volunteer crew at Kinghorn spent nearly 77 hours at sea and many more hours training and preparing for the next call-out; commends the fact that, despite the recent severe weather, Kinghorn lifeboat station has not had a single day off service because of the conditions; believes that it was due to the determination of the volunteer crew that they and the lifeboat were able to go out to sea whatever the weather, and applauds the generosity of people in the Kirkcaldy constituency, even during difficult economic times, which funds all rescues carried out by Kinghorn RNLI.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7894 Linda Fabiani: Congratulations to Christopher Kane</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Christopher Kane on winning the British Fashion Council/<em>Vogue</em> Designer Fashion Fund, which will allow this Scots designer the opportunity to develop his business into a global brand; compliments <em>Vogue</em> and the British Fashion Council on their forward-looking attitude in running the fund, and looks forward to Christopher Kane&rsquo;s continued success in the world of fashion.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7893 Linda Fabiani: St Vincent&rsquo;s Primary Top Micro-tyco</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Robyn Conlan, Bethan Malley, Olivia Beaton, Stephanie Devine, Astrid Corkill and Amna Assed of St Vincent&rsquo;s Primary School in East Kilbride on winning the micro-tyco challenge with an incredible performance of raising more than &pound;4,000 for WildHearts in Action from a &pound;1 start-up fund; praises their efforts and their imagination and endorses the work of the charity, which provides microloans to women in West Africa to help them start their own businesses, and further looks forward to these pupils continuing to make a contribution to society throughout their lives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7892 Kenneth Gibson: Alcohol Minimum Pricing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes news that the UK Government plans to introduce a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales later in 2011; recognises that there are plans for a trial in Manchester with alcohol at 50p per unit; understands that, even with this relatively modest increase in the basic price, research indicates that this would result in 3,000 fewer deaths every year and 41,000 fewer cases of chronic illness each year if implemented across England and Wales; further welcomes the news that Labour has backed these proposals, which it believes will have a huge positive impact on the health and wellbeing of English and Welsh citizens; believes that the unionist parties in Scotland should now back proposals of the Scottish Government to introduce a minimum price for alcohol in order to tackle Scotland&rsquo;s unhealthy relationship with alcohol, and believes that a new Bill specifically with that intention should be introduced early in the next session.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7891 Kenneth Gibson: Disability Living Allowance Reform</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision by the UK Government to reform the Disability Living Allowance benefit in the way that it has; recognises the importance of this benefit to thousands of disabled people across the country and believes that the proposed reforms will have a negative impact on those who currently receive it; considers that there are serious flaws in the consultation paper and that there is little evidence to support the Department for Work and Pensions&rsquo; case for such reform; further believes that it is likely that benefit expenditure will fall but that health and social care expenditure will inevitably increase, thus transferring the burden of cost to areas that the Scottish Parliament is responsible for, and, as such, calls on the Minister for Disabled People to withdraw the proposals.</p>
