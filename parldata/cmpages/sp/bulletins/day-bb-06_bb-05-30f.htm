<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4456</strong> <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to McDonald Engineers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the management and workforce of McDonald Engineers in Glenrothes, which recently extended its premises by 10,000 ft2; recognises that McDonald Engineers was formed 60 years ago and supplies the UK and European market with its copper hot water cylinders, standard cylinders for domestic use and large commercial calorifiers for offices, hospitals, swimming pools and oil rigs and is a recognised specialist in the renewable sector, as a manufacturer of solar powered systems, and in the heat pump and combined heat and power sectors, and considers that this is precisely the kind of company that should be supported and encouraged by Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Executive.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4455</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Ban on Dropping-Off at Glasgow Airport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals by British Airports Authority (BAA) which include a ban on cars and certain taxis from dropping-off passengers immediately outside the Glasgow Airport terminal; further notes the strong public reaction to this proposal; is concerned that this will impact on ordinary passengers and business interests; believes that this would not show Glasgow city and surrounding areas in a good light if passengers are so inconvenienced compared with other airports on pick-up and departure; is not convinced that this proposal is likely to encourage greater use of public transport; believes that a public authority would be required to at least consult on such radical proposals; further believes that the charges proposed are unreasonable, and calls on BAA to withdraw these proposals and for the Scottish Executive to consider the impact which this will have on the image of Scotland and its tourism, leisure and business interests.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4454&lt;&gt; </strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Bank Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the opinion issued by the Office of Fair Trading on 5 April 2006 that default charges from credit card issuers, mortgage providers and banks above the level of &pound;12 are unfair; believes that high charges exacerbate debt and cause distress to Scottish consumers, particularly in rural areas such as the Highlands where it can exacerbate existing problems of income deprivation; commends the campaigns from Scottish student unions to recover charges, and considers that financial services should work towards protecting consumers by providing 14 days&rsquo; advance written notice of the issuing of any charge, ensuring that no default charges are set above &pound;12, ending the practice of imposing charges on charges, doing more to promote financial literacy, making the terms of contracts clearer to consumers, investing in Citizens Advice Bureaux and other financial advice services and ensuing that poverty prevention is at the core of their business practice.</p>
<p>Supported by: Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-4453</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> <strong>Scottish Water Development Constraints</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is becoming frustrated by the increasing number of development constraints imposed by Scottish Water in the Highlands and Islands because of potable water supply limitations; notes that the constraints are blocking the construction of much-needed affordable housing and restricting business developments offering employment opportunities; further notes that Scottish Water&rsquo;s inability to provide a potable water supply means that the new Dunvegan fire station is sitting unused while the local fire officers remain in their old, sub-standard premises; believes that this situation is becoming untenable, and calls on Scottish Water to investigate the feasibility of reactivating old mains supplies and on the Scottish Executive to consider offering grant aid to those developing alternative private water supplies.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4452</strong> <strong>John Home Robertson:</strong> <strong>Nuclear Power and a Balanced Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s target of generating 40% of electricity from renewables, its promotion of energy efficiency and its stipulation that the safe storage of radioactive waste must be addressed before decisions can be made about new nuclear development; notes that the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management has reported that permanent geological storage is the appropriate solution for safe storage of such waste; believes that reduction of CO2 emissions must be the main priority for planning for the future; notes that fossil fuel power stations in Scotland are emitting 18 million tonnes of CO2 per year; recognises that older power stations will eventually have to be decommissioned; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s stated objective of maintaining Scotland&rsquo;s share of the British electricity generation industry; concurs with the view of respected environmental scientist, Professor James Lovelock, that nuclear energy is &quot;an essential part of a portfolio of energy sources&quot;; notes that in 2001 a Swiss study of large-scale energy sources around the world found nuclear electricity generation to be the safest of all large-scale energy sources; understands the support for nuclear developments in East Lothian, Ayrshire, Dumfriesshire and Caithness, and looks forward to the development of replacement nuclear power stations in Scotland to meet our needs for baseload electricity while reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>

Labour Rights and Sportswear Production in Asia</em>; notes that, as top sportswear brands prepare to showcase their wares at this year&rsquo;s FIFA World Cup finals in Germany, many sportswear workers in Asia face discrimination, intimidation, violence and dismissal for joining unions to fight for better pay and conditions; further notes that the majority of these workers are women from poor communities supporting children and families and who are being paid as little as 32 pence an hour; urges global sports brands to do more to improve labour conditions, and believes that Scotland should show leadership in the fight for trade justice by realising the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s international development policy ambition for Scotland to become a fair trade country.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4428</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>The Energy Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the argument for new nuclear build in the United Kingdom has not been made; notes that, even with an accelerated planning system, new nuclear power stations could not contribute either to plugging the &quot;energy gap&quot; or to carbon reductions by 2020 when existing electricity generating capacity is run down and carbon emissions have to be curbed; further notes that existing Scottish electricity generation is provided 22% by gas, 26% by coal, 35% by nuclear and 13% by renewables but that around 17% of electricity generated in Scotland is exported; further notes that massive investment in new infrastructure across the UK is providing for a diversity of gas supply from many countries including Norway, with Russian gas only contributing around 1%, and that new clean coal technologies are now available; also notes that the supply of wind power is growing faster than predicted and that in Germany wind power capacity is already equivalent to UK nuclear capacity; further believes that new nuclear build would be inconsistent with environmental sustainability, adding to the legacy of highly toxic nuclear waste and the huge public cost of decommissioning and storage; urges the Scottish Executive to see the bigger picture in which electricity accounts for just 19% of total energy consumed in Scotland and carbon emissions by sector were last recorded as 17% transport, 11% domestic, 12% business and 37% energy supply, and further urges the Executive to recognise the enormous potential for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by energy efficiency and conservation, greater use of combined heat and power and rapid investment in the full range of renewable technologies, including microgeneration and biomass.</p>
