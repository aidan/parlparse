            disaster; notes that, following an initial grant of £399 million,

            and insert &quot;notes that tourism in Scotland faces considerable 
            competitive disadvantages in comparison with countries such as Ireland 
            in respect of the high pound, high levels of tax on fuel, high business 
            rates and lower resourcing for generic and other promotion; believes 
            that those involved in the tourism industry are to be congratulated 
            for their work and the measure of success achieved despite these disadvantages; 
            further believes that the tourism strategy launched by the Scottish 
            Executive, whilst it has certain good elements, cannot in itself meet 
            the needs of the sector, and calls for (a) an immediate assessment 
            of the efficacy of the Ossian on-line booking system, (b) targetting 
            of resources to permit locally based marketing, (c) a review of the 
            level of landing charges in our airports and (d) a commitment that 
            the area tourist board structure will be amended in the light of the 
            conclusions of the local economic forums with the aim of finding the
