<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#theend">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2768#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Lloyds TSB Takeover of HBOS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament gives a general welcome to the measures taken by the UK and other governments to tackle the current banking crisis; considers, however, that the recapitalisation plans announced by HM Treasury in October 2008 have fundamentally changed the landscape under which competition rules were waived to enable a merger between Lloyds TSB and Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS); further considers that inconsistent statements have come from the Treasury about whether or not the banks would independently have access to the recapitalisation funds; believes that this ambiguity is not serving anyone&rsquo;s interests in the present environment; further believes that losing HBOS corporate headquarters and jobs in Edinburgh would seriously jeopardise the city&rsquo;s position as a financial centre; sees no reason why HBOS should not be able to access UK Treasury recapitalisation and, therefore, liquidity funding on the same independent basis as other major banks, and, with this in mind, considers it a very real possibility that an independent HBOS solution could be found that may well be in the best interests of shareholders, employees, customers and the Scottish economy at large.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2767</strong> <strong>John Swinney: British-Irish Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the successful summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in Edinburgh; notes the outcomes of the summit in relation to demography, energy and the ongoing business of the Council; notes also that the Council gave consideration  the global economic situation; believes that the Council is an invaluable forum for strengthening intergovernmental relationships; supports the Scottish ministers&rsquo; proposal to lead a workstream on renewable energy, and encourages them to continue to support the Council in addressing issues of real and common concern.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2766</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Draft Pre-release Access to Official Statistics (Scotland) Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Finance Committee recommends that the&nbsp;draft Pre-release Access to Official Statistics (Scotland) Order 2008 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2765</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Draft Provision of School Lunches (Disapplication of the Requirement to Charge) (Scotland) Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee recommends that the&nbsp;draft Provision of School Lunches (Disapplication of the Requirement to Charge) (Scotland) Order 2008 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2764</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2008 Amendment Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Finance Committee recommends that the&nbsp;draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2008 Amendment Order 2008 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2763</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Draft Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Scheme of Assistance) Regulations 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Local Government and Communities Committee recommends that the&nbsp;draft Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Scheme of Assistance) Regulations 2008 be approved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2762</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>All Citizens Equal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent controversy regarding the right of naturalised citizens to play football for the Scottish national team and affirms its view that all citizens of Scotland are equal and that a naturalised citizen is no less a citizen, and has no fewer rights, than those born in this country.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2761</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Scotland&rsquo;s World Amateur Team Golf Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with delight the victory of the Scottish team in the World Amateur Team Golf Championship and congratulates the playing members of the team, Wallace Booth (Comrie), Gavin Dear (Murrayshall) and Callum Macaulay (Tulliallan) and team captain George Crawford, for bringing the Eisenhower Trophy to Scotland, the home of golf; notes that it is only eight years since Scotland first entered the event as a separate nation, having previously participated as part of a Great Britain and Ireland team, which won the title just four times in the 50-year history of the event; further notes that Scotland now holds world team titles at both amateur and profession level, and wishes Colin Montgomery and Alastair Forsyth every success as they seek to retain the title at the Omega Mission Hill&rsquo;s World Cup, starting on 27 November  2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2760</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Scottish Retail Excellence Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Simon Howie Butchers on being named Independent Retailer of the Year in the 2008 Scottish Retail Excellence Awards and notes that this success follows on from being shortlisted for last year&rsquo;s awards and represents well-deserved recognition for an energetic and ambitious local company, which provides quality Perthshire meat products to local shoppers through its shops in Perth and Auchterarder and throughout the country through links with Morrison&rsquo;s, Sainsbury&rsquo;s, Spar, Tesco and Waitrose.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2759#</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Digital Switchover</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the UK&rsquo;s digital TV switchover commences with the switchover of the Selkirk transmitter on 6 and 20 November 2008 in the Border TV region; believes that digital is a positive development within television but is concerned that the Switchover Help Scheme, established to give practical support to those people expected to have the most difficulty in making the switch to digital TV, has been subject to doubts over its effectiveness, and expresses further concern that, with the Border TV region having the highest percentage of viewers receiving their television signal through relay transmitters, the switchover will create a two-tier service with more than 50% of viewers in the Borders able to access only 50% of digital channels.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2758</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Employment Support Allowance and its Impact on Disabled People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the sanctions contained in the new Employment Support Allowance may work against the interests of disabled people and notes, in particular, the view of Leonard Cheshire Disability that &quot;The additional threat of penalties will not result in more job offers for disabled people&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2757</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Tommy Sampson</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Tommy Sampson, Dunfermline-based big band leader, who passed away on 20 October 2008; notes his long musical career, which started with the Salvation Army and over the years saw him perform as band leader, instrumentalist, band and choral arranger, conductor and vocalist; further notes his performance at the Carnegie Hall, Dunfermline, in January 2008; acknowledges his considerable contribution to music and inspiration to other musicians; further acknowledges his fund-raising work for charities, and expresses its condolences to the family and friends of Tommy Sampson.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2756</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Scottish Mental Health Art and Film Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the excellent and important work of the Mental Health Foundation and partners for the Scottish Mental Health Art and Film Festival; welcomes the production of the play, Talk To Me, performed by a group of young people from Hamilton Information Project for Youth and Healthy Valley Clydesdale, at the Motherwell Theatre, and commends the fact that the play effectively and informatively highlights the mental health challenges facing young people today, including issues of bullying, self-harm, eating disorders, bereavement and drug and alcohol issues.</p>
