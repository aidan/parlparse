          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1899</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Making the Most of Scotland&rsquo;s Forests</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the significant contribution which Scotland&rsquo;s forestry and primary wood processing sector makes to the economy, tourism and jobs; recognises the environmental benefits of the creation and restoration of more than 8,600 hectares of native woodland in the last two years; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s forests can contribute to the achievement of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s renewable energy targets; welcomes the contribution made to delivering greater benefits to communities through 70 partnership agreements between Forestry Commission Scotland and communities and through the setting up of the regional forestry forums and the Strategic Timber Transport Fund, and believes that all stakeholders from the public, private and voluntary sectors should continue to work together to maximise the value of forestry to the economy, the environment and the people of Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1898</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland&rsquo;s Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to a 30% increase in affordable housing provision by 2007-08 in order to increase the availability of social rented accommodation for homeless people, reduce pressure on waiting lists and help first-time buyers on to the housing ladder; welcomes the introduction of the Housing Quality Standard and the improvements in housing quality that are resulting from substantial community ownership and fuel poverty programmes; recognises the major achievements flowing from devolution for housing in Scotland, such as a modernised and single tenancy in the social rented sector, progressive homelessness legislation and the development of tenant participation and rights, and looks forward to the forthcoming Housing Bill which will raise standards in the private housing sector and strengthen the rights of private sector tenants.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1897</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>First ScotRail Anti-Violence Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the poster campaign by First ScotRail and the British Transport Police highlighting the physical and verbal abuse that many rail workers face in the course of their working lives; believes that nobody should have to endure the threat of violence at work and that drawing attention to this problem and educating people about the consequences of their actions is a positive step, and congratulates First Scotrail and the British Transport Police for taking the first step towards tackling this serious problem.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1896#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Proposals to Deregulate Gambling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent publication of the Gambling Bill by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government; notes that the deregulation of gambling proposed in this Bill will lead to more casinos being built and that it is highly likely that more problem gambling will result; further notes with concern the dismissal of the legitimate concerns of those opposed to the proposals by Tessa Jowell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, as being &quot;a whiff of snobbery&quot;, and believes that such comments are unworthy of a government minister and should be retracted.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1895</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</p>
