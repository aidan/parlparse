            <strong>Johann Lamont: Tackling Religious Discrimination</strong>—That the Parliament 
            congratulates the many organisations in Scotland which work to challenge 
            religious bigotry; welcomes the initiative taken by the Celtic Football 
            Club in its Social Charter and its Bhoys Against Bigotry Campaign 
            in seeking to promote equality and challenge bigoted attitudes through 
            a programme of work with young people and their schools; notes that, 
            in recognising the power it has to influence the way young people 
            see their world and in showing a willingness to use that power positively, 
            Celtic Football Club provides an excellent model for those who wish 
            to tackle bigotry and discrimination; acknowledges the immense potential 
            of such an approach; urges Scotland’s football and other sports clubs 
            to consider pursuing similar initiatives; believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should consider how it might support the development of 
            this work across Scotland; congratulates Glasgow City Council, in 
            partnership with Rangers FC, Celtic FC, the Catholic Church, the Church 
            of Scotland and the 'Nil by Mouth' campaign, in securing funding from 
            the Millennium Award Partnership Scheme to pursue initiatives which 
            tackle religious bigotry and discrimination, and urges the Scottish 
            Executive and the appropriate committees of the Scottish Parliament, 
            in co-operation with this project, to examine how such aims might 
            be progressed and to explore the possibility of legislation to make 
            discrimination on the grounds of religion an offence.</font></p>

            <strong>Christine Grahame: Broomhill Day Centre, Penicuik</strong>—That the 
            Parliament congratulates Broomhill Day Centre on winning an &quot;Impact 
            Award for Excellence&quot; sponsored by Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline 
            Beecham; notes that out of 10 awards in the UK this year, Broomhill 
            is the only day centre to win such an award; offers Tilly Suttle and 
            her team at the centre its warmest congratulations in not only winning 
            the award but also £25,000 which will in part be used towards improving 
            facilities at Broomhill, including a befriending scheme, music therapies 
            and gentle exercises machines and affirms its recognition of the valuable 
            work of day centres such as Broomhill and the personnel who work so 
            hard within them, particularly the volunteers, by making a commitment 
            that their funding will not be jeopardised.</font></p>

            <strong>Fiona McLeod: Young People</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes the 
            Scottish Executive’s commitment to a National Youth Strategy; recommends 
            that this is formulated in consultation with young people themselves; 
            believes that strong emphasis should be given to the provision of 
            social facilities for young people, and welcomes the new youth room 
            to be opened in Westerton Hall by East Dunbartonshire Council.</font></p>

            <strong>Christine Grahame: Water Safety and Swimming Lessons</strong>—That the 
            Parliament notes that, while Scotland represents 10% of the UK population, 
            it has 15% of the drownings and that although the incidence of drownings 
            is falling elsewhere in the UK it is on the increase in Scotland; 
            further notes that according to data for 1999, there was a 50% increase 
            on the previous year in the number of children aged 14 and under who 
            drowned and that, while the majority occurred in rivers and streams, 
            there was an increase in drownings in garden ponds, water features 
            and containers holding water; is aware that England has a Water Safety 
            Officer whose function is to increase awareness of the dangers of 
            waterways, while Scotland has no such post and that while in England 
            every child is expected to be taught to swim 25 metres by the age 
            of 11, in Scotland 14 out of the 32 local authorities do not provide 
            swimming lessons for all pupils; further notes that in answer to question 
            S1W-10389 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 30 October 2000, the former Minister 
            for Children and Education refused to make it a duty of his office 
            to collect centrally information regarding swimming instruction for 
            primary schools and therefore urges the Scottish Executive, with the 
            assistance of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and 
            in particular their Water and Leisure Department, to (a) determine 
            what the current level of provision of swimming instruction for primary 
            school children is in each local authority area, with a view to providing 
            adequate funding for a national programme, (b) undertake to collate 
            data on the incidence of drownings with a view to establishing appropriate 
            educational, information and preventative measures and (c) appoint 
            a Water Safety Officer for Scotland to co-ordinate all of the above.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1651</strong> 
            <strong>Fergus Ewing: Dentistry Services in Rural Scotland</strong>—That the 
            Parliament believes that the setting of the threshold for NHS commitment 
            payments to dentists at a gross earnings level of £25,000 a year penalises 
            those dentists who practice in remote parts of Scotland who are unable 
            to achieve the threshold earnings and therefore access the payment; 
            notes that local access to the services of a dentist in such parts 
            of Scotland is crucial but severely threatened by the current flat 
            rate threshold; urges the Scottish Executive to press for a reduced 
            threshold rate for those dentists operating in rural areas where it 
            cannot be expected, given their patient base, that the threshold will 
            ever be achieved and calls upon the Executive to ensure that people 
            living in rural Scotland and the islands of Scotland are able to access 
            NHS dental services locally.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1650#</strong> 
            <strong>Kay Ullrich: School Swimming Lessons</strong>—That the Parliament notes 
            the report compiled by Scottish Swimming, which highlights that almost 
            50% of local authorities in Scotland no longer provide school swimming 
            lessons; acknowledges that this coincides with a report from the Royal 
            Society for the Prevention of Accidents which records an increase 
            in the number of children in Scotland who die as a result of drowning; 
            recognises that the withdrawal of local authority-provided school 
            swimming lessons has a greater impact on children from less well off 
            backgrounds, and encourages Scottish local authorities to ensure that 
            every pupil in Scotland has access to at least one publicly funded 
            course of swimming lessons prior to leaving primary school.</font></p>

            <strong>Donald Gorrie: Commission on Sectarianism</strong>—That the Parliament 
            believes that a commission composed of MSPs and well-informed people 
            from outwith the parliament should be set up with a remit to examine 
            and report on the extent of sectarian bigotry, discrimination and 
            violence, on what useful action is already being taken to counter 
            sectarianism and on what further measures the Parliament or the Scottish 
            Executive should take, or persuade other bodies to take, to reduce 
            this blot on Scottish society. </font></p>
