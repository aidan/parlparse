          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2096.1</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Towards a Sustainable Aquaculture Industry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2096) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, leave out from &quot;commitment&quot; to end and insert &quot;stated commitment to a sustainable aquaculture industry; welcomes and endorses the aim of the Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture to establish &quot;a sustainable, diverse, competitive and economically viable aquaculture industry&quot;; further welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to a review of regulatory procedures and associated costs; notes that the wording of the title of the motion, through the use of the word &quot;towards&quot;, acknowledges that the industry is currently not sustainable, and calls on the Executive, following its review, to develop a regulatory framework and overarching statutory code of practice that will include statutory duties and greater transparency for area management groups, codification of sea cage containment standards, statutory sea lice monitoring and reporting, provisions in respect of wild salmon and sea trout lochs, no relaxation of present constraints on the use of veterinary medicines, properly-financed transfer of powers from the Crown Estate to local authorities, proper support for all aquaculture activities and implementation of locational guidelines and optimum stocking levels in addition to working within the carrying capacity of the environment both locally and nationally and throughout the supply chain.&quot;</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2096.3</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Towards a Sustainable Aquaculture Industry</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2096) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, insert at end &quot;but questions the timetable and scope of the proposed Aquaculture bill; further notes that the Executive has still failed to meet 14 targets it set out in the Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture, and laments that it has taken it six years to set up a review into the current regulatory framework with a view to lightening the burden of regulation that threatens to choke the industry.&quot;</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2093.1</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Efficient Government</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2093) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, leave out &quot;welcomes&quot; and insert &quot;notes&quot;.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2093.2</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Efficient Government</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2093) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, leave out from &quot;and endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that such efficiency savings can only be made if there is a substantial reduction in the scope and size of government in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to move away from its target culture of intervention and interference as well as to end the monopoly provision of public services in order to ensure better value for money.&quot;</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2093.3</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Efficient Government</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2093) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, insert at end &quot;but believes that such efficiency, effectiveness and productivity will only be delivered with the co-operation and involvement of the workers who deliver these public services and not by attacking them or slashing the number of workers employed in these services; further believes that public service workers embody all that is good about our small country and that they should be properly paid and recognised for the essential duties they perform; rejects any suggestion that reducing workforces improves effectiveness, efficiency or productivity but does believe that such action reduces the quality and scope of public services available to citizens across Scotland, and further believes that the privatisation of public services to date has proved clearly that public provision is superior in relation to both efficiency and quality and that further privatisation should therefore be opposed.&quot;</p>
