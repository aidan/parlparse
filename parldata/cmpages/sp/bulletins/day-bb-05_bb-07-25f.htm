          <p><strong>*S2M-3121</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Waverley Bill Gets the Green Light</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the terms of the Preliminary Stage Report on the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill published 22 July 2005; commends all the campaigners in their efforts to reopen this railway to the Borders as a reality and rejects a termination of the railway at Gorebridge; notes, however, the criticism in the report of Scottish Borders Council in its preparation of the case and the caveats that follow from its failings to prepare adequately; notes that the broader economic case for the railway to the Borders has been recognised and, in particular, the social inclusion and tourism possibilities; further notes that the committee in principle supports a station at Stow and recognises the role for Waverley Route Trust, and urges the Scottish Executive to recognise the support reflected throughout the committee and the Parliament for the reinstatement of this lifeline link to the Scottish Borders.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3120</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Alcohol Misuse and the Remedies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the valuable work done by Borders Counselling on Alcohol and Substances (BCAS); notes its commitment to promoting a healthy and responsible approach to alcohol use, providing counselling, education and support to those suffering from alcohol/substance misuse and their families; congratulates the volunteers on their essential work; notes that in the Scottish Borders there were, in 2002-03, 119 alcohol-related hospital discharges of people aged 24 and under, representing 43 per 10,000 population compared with the Scottish rate of four per 10,000, an increase in such discharges in the Borders of 25% since 1998 against a national increase of 15%; further notes with concern that discharges with alcohol-related liver disease have risen by 64% in the Borders compared with 37% Scotland-wide and that alcohol-related deaths have increased by 70% compared with 15% nationally; considers therefore that, while congratulating BCAS, the substantial sums spent by the Scottish Executive on national advertising to deter excessive drinking are failing, with the consequential costs to human well-being and to society, and therefore calls on the Executive to set up an independent inquiry as a matter of priority to establish which interventions, both short, medium and long term, will reverse this worrying trend both Borders-wide and elsewhere.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3119</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle:</strong> <strong>Railway Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the unacceptable levels of trespass, vandalism, injury and theft on the Scottish rail network; calls on parents, educators and relevant public agencies to take a proactive stance in warning children of potential dangers on the railways; supports the efforts of Network Rail through its approach of education, engineering and enforcement, and notes the huge financial cost, delays and disruption caused by railway crime and the potentially large safety risks posed by such activity.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3118</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Rural Schools in Moray</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern Moray Council&rsquo;s proposals to merge or close 21 small or rural schools; notes the widespread opposition to the proposals amongst parents and local communities that has led to the Moray Save our Schools Campaign and other local campaign groups being set up; believes that small or rural schools play a vital role in ensuring the success and sustainability of rural communities; recognises that, while it is right and proper for local authorities to review and seek to improve their school&rsquo;s infrastructure, this must be done in full consultation with parents and should take into account the invaluable role of sustainable rural schools, and believes that Moray Council should recognise the strength of feeling amongst parents and local communities and re-evaluate its proposals.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3117</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Benefits of Dialogue between Steiner and Mainstream Education Sectors</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Steiner Schools in Scotland for providing education which focuses on a child&rsquo;s spiritual, physical and moral well-being as well as academic progress; notes the recent research publication, <em>Steiner Schools in England</em>, by Professor Woods of the University of West of England, which compared Steiner Schools with those in the state sector; agrees with him that &quot;there is great potential benefit from mutual dialogue and professional interaction between Steiner and mainstream educators&quot;; welcomes high-level dialogue between the Steiner Fellowship (the UK Steiner accreditation body), local education authorities in England and the UK Government which has led to the prospect of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s first publicly funded Steiner Academy in Hereford, and calls on the Scottish Executive to engage actively with local authorities in Scotland and encourage the schools to be brought within the publicly funded sector, in a similar fashion to other European countries such as Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-3115</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Funding of Scottish Civic Forum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that neither the Scottish Executive nor the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body is prepared to provide funding to help keep the Scottish Civic Forum going; is conscious that the forum was a major plank in the Consultative Steering Group&rsquo;s proposals for the new parliamentary arrangements in Scotland; recognises that the Scottish Civic Forum has done some good work and has also been the target of some criticism; believes that the forum or some similar body outwith the Parliament and the Executive should be an essential part of a vigorous Scottish democracy, and urges the Executive and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to meet the forum, MSPs and other interested parties to discuss how best to provide this democratic structure.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3114</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Support for Native American Tribes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the dam development by PacifiCorp, an American subsidiary of ScottishPower, which has devastated more than 350 miles of historic salmon spawning grounds on the Klamath River in California and Oregon; calls on ScottishPower as the parent company to live up to its environmental responsibilities and scrap the future dam proposals at its annual general meeting on Friday 22 July 2005, and applauds the Karuk, Yurok, Hoopa and Klamath people on their stance and gives unqualified support to their campaign.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-3112</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Wood Fuel for Warmth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Sustainable Development Commission on the publication of its recent report, <em>Wood Fuel for Warmth</em>; welcomes the findings of the report that wood-fuel heating could radically cut climate-changing emissions from household heating systems, while creating jobs and tackling fuel poverty at the same time; notes that households with wood fuel heating systems can cut carbon emissions from heating and hot water by up to 96%; believes that wood provides a valuable fuel resource in rural areas where fuel choices are often limited, and calls on the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to take a more flexible attitude to wood fuel installations.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3111</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Falls Prevention Awareness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch by Help the Aged of the first National Falls Awareness Day on 19 July 2005; commends this year&rsquo;s theme of &quot;Be strong, Be steady&quot;, which is about helping older people to keep their independence; recognises the importance of such a day, with its aim of highlighting preventative measures to reduce the chances of falling in later life, and applauds the local initiatives throughout Scotland to promote this aim, including the event at Bonkle Day Care Centre in Lanarkshire organised by the falls team from Wishaw General Hospital.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3110</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>North American Indians, Klamath River and ScottishPower</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes to Scotland a delegation of representatives from North American Indian tribal nations and US fishing and environmental organisations; recognises their quest to obtain justice from the Scottish-based multinational, ScottishPower; backs their campaign to oblige ScottishPower to establish the highest environmental standards in its operation in North America; regards the historic damage to the environment of the Klamath River caused by previous owners of the dams as having had an unacceptable and serious impact on the social, cultural and economic situation of the native peoples; notes the &quot;personal commitment to find the right solution&quot; from ScottishPower Chief Executive, Ian Russell, last year, and urges ScottishPower to do what it can to back that commitment ahead of the anticipated sale of its US subsidiary PacifiCorp and to secure a commitment from the buyer that any and all improvement commenced will be completed.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3109</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Ten Thousand No2ID Pledges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates No2ID campaigners for achieving their target of 10,000 pledges of support from people who state that they &quot;will refuse to register for an ID card and will donate &pound;10 to a legal defence fund if 10,000 other people will also make the same pledge&quot;; recognises that this substantial number of signatories is further evidence that public support for the UK ID card scheme is falling, and encourages more members of the public and politicians to support this pledge and resist the Identity Cards Bill.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3106</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Flawed Draft Hepatitis C Plan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the comments of Dr Nicola Rowan, Director of the Mainliners UK Hepatitis C Resource Centre in Scotland, that the draft hepatitis C action plan for Scotland neglects vital areas of care for people living with the virus and that there was &quot;very little detail&quot; about treatment and support for those already infected and seemed to be &quot;little will to adequately address the fact&quot; that the majority remain undiagnosed; further notes with alarm that, of the 50,000 individuals estimated to be infected with Hepatitis C in Scotland, at least 60% remain undetected and yet the plan proposes &quot;low key&quot; awareness raising for the public; considers that of particular concern is the lack of funding to make the proposals workable according to Dr Rowan, a comment supported by David Liddell, Director of the Scottish Drugs Forum, and in all the circumstances calls on the Scottish Executive to respond to these concerns with immediacy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3105</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to St Andrews</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews for its running of the 134th Open Championship; congratulates Tiger Woods and Scotland&rsquo;s Colin Montgomerie for achieving first and second place respectively and Lloyd Saltman, the leading amateur, and looks forward to the Open Championship returning to Scotland in 2007 at Carnoustie.</p>
