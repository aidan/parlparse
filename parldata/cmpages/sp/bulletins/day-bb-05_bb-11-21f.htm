<p><b>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.

<p><b>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</b></p>
<p><b>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</b></p>
<p><b>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>New and altered motions and amendments</b></p>
<p><b>*S2M-3604</b> <b>Shiona Baird:</b> <b>Edinburgh University Students Vote for Zero Waste</b>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Edinburgh University Students&rsquo; Association, taken at its recent AGM, to pass a motion setting itself a target for zero waste; notes that, as well as calling for waste to be reduced by half every five years, the motion also sets a charge for plastic bags in Students&rsquo; Association shops; congratulates the students at Edinburgh University for being the first group in Scotland to set a zero waste target, and calls on the University of Edinburgh and the University&rsquo;s Accommodation Services to accede to student calls to set similar targets.</p>
<p><b>*S2M-3603#</b> <b>Dr Elaine Murray:</b> <b>One Plus Grow Your Own Training Programme</b>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the support given to lone parents and other excluded groups by One Plus and its partner organisations, including offering access to vocational training and employment, and believes that the &quot;Grow Your Own&quot; training programme for community workers in north west Dumfries, organised by the Maxwelltown Umbrella Group and One Plus, is an excellent example of partnership working.</p>
<p><b>*S2M-3602</b> <b>Patrick Harvie:</b> <b>Campaigners of the Year</b>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly congratulates the pupils from Drumchapel High School, who have been named Campaigners of the Year at the Herald Diageo Politician of the Year Awards, and everyone in the school and the wider community who have supported them; recognises that the most fitting reward for their efforts would be for the children of asylum seekers to be given the same basic standards of protection that all other children are entitled to in Scotland and throughout the world, so that they can live in safety and without fear, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to redouble its efforts and deliver this protection as a matter of the utmost urgency.</p><p><b>*S2M-3601</b> <b>Fiona Hyslop:</b> <b>Tam the Gun</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the death of Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay, known as Tam the Gun, who fired the One o&rsquo;Clock Gun from the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle for more than 25 years; acknowledges his contribution to the Scottish tourist industry and the Army Benevolent Fund, and extends its condolences to his family.</p><p>Supported by: Margaret Smith<b>*</b>, Mike Pringle<b>*</b>, Mr Kenny MacAskill<b>*</b>, Mark Ballard<b>*</b> </p><p><b>S2M-3600</b> <b>Dr Jean Turner:</b> <b>Outsourcing of NHS Laboratory Services</b>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns any proposals that laboratory services provided in the NHS should be outsourced to private laboratories, either in the United Kingdom or abroad; recognises that laboratory services are an essential clinical component in the management of patients and are not &quot;figure factories&quot;; notes that close consultation between laboratory consultants and the referring clinician is essential to maintain a safe clinical environment for patients, and believes that it is essential that laboratories continue to provide training and expertise at both medical and scientific levels and that acquired skills are not lost.</p><p>Supported by: Frances Curran<b>*</b>, Carolyn Leckie<b>*</b>, Colin Fox<b>*</b>, Mr Andrew Welsh<b>*</b>, Eleanor Scott<b>*</b>, Tommy Sheridan<b>*</b>, Brian Adam<b>*</b>, Robin Harper<b>*</b> </p><p><b>S2M-3599</b> <b>John Swinburne:</b> <b>The Return of Pension Contributions to Ex-employees of the Scottish Bus Group</b>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the unacceptable treatment accorded to the former employees of the Scottish Bus Group in respect of their pension entitlement which was appropriated by HM Treasury when the Bus Group was privatised in 1990; further deplores the decision by HM Treasury to return only 45% of the contributions taken, and demands that the remaining 55%, which totals around &pound;100 million plus the interest accrued, be returned immediately.</p><p><b>S2M-3598</b> <b>Robin Harper:</b> <b>Welcome Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland to the Parliament</b>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland stall which will be in the Garden Lobby of the Parliament for the week beginning 21 November 2005;
