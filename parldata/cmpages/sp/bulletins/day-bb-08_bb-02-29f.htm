<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1461</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>One Book - One Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the One Book - One Edinburgh campaign for all the work that it has done to celebrate Scottish literature and promote reading across the city of Edinburgh; notes that 10,000 copies of the <em>Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</em> were distributed on Friday 22 February 2008 in cafes, bars, offices, high schools, hotels and other venues throughout the city; believes that the campaign promotes both the value of education and the joy of reading; recognises that in 2007 a similar number of copies of <em>Kidnapped </em>were distributed across Edinburgh thanks to the fantastic Bookcrossing scheme; notes that some copies have found their way as far afield as Sweden, Barcelona and Hong Kong; remembers that Edinburgh became the very first UNESCO City of Literature in 2004, and wishes the city of Kolkata all the very best in its endeavours to be the next UNESCO City of Literature.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1460</strong> <strong>Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>VAT Relief on the Renovation of Listed Buildings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament asks the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to end VAT on the renovation of listed buildings and recognises that VAT on the renovation of historic buildings is a disincentive to properly maintain our cultural and architectural history.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1459</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>The Home Detention Curfew Licence (Prescribed Standard Conditions) (Scotland) Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Home Detention Curfew Licence (Prescribed Standard Conditions) (Scotland) Order 2008 (SSI 2008/36).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1458</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Success of RBS and HBOS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) and HBOS plc for achieving year-end pre-tax profits of &pound;9.9 billion and &pound;5.47 billion respectively in 2007; welcomes the strong profit margins, which have come during an unstable time for the banking sector across the world, thus underlining the strength and success of these two major Scottish-headquartered companies; recognises the importance and contribution that both banks make to the Scottish economy and applauds their continued positions among the world leaders in the banking and financial sectors; also notes the various foundations and charities that RBS and HBOS donate to and work with, as well as the importance that they give to corporate social responsibility; and believes that all Scotland should celebrate the continued success of RBS and HBOS.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1457</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Language Diversity in Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament affirms its commitment to supporting children in school whose first language is not English and believes that language diversity is a positive benefit in Scotland&rsquo;s schools and across Scottish society; recognises the challenges faced by teachers, pupils and parents in multi-lingual classrooms, particularly in areas such as Glasgow where 8,853 city children speak one of 102 languages other than English at home, including Punjabi, Urdu, Arabic, Mandarin, Polish, Cantonese, Swahili, Kurdish, Thai, French, German, Spanish and Italian, alongside Gaelic, Scots, Doric and British Sign Language; congratulates Glasgow City Council and other local authorities for the work that they are already doing in response to language diversity, and calls for the Scottish Government to do more to support local authorities such as Glasgow and to respond to the calls that have been made for special funding to be made available in order that language never becomes a barrier in Scottish education.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1456</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Part-time Pay Penalty for Mothers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the article <em>Part-time pay penalty for mothers</em> which appeared in the Economic Journal which found that women who return to work after having a child are often faced with drastic pay cuts when they return for part-time employment; notes that six million women in the United Kingdom are currently working part time and that those part-time hourly earnings are 26% lower than full-time earnings, and believes that more can be done to ensure that mothers returning to work are entitled to equal pay in comparison to their full-time associates.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1455</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>St Mary&rsquo;s RC Primary School - 50th Birthday</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Mary&rsquo;s RC Primary School in Bathgate, West Lothian, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary on 27 February 2008; notes that generations of Bathgate children and the Bathgate community have benefited from the work of the school in the last 50 years, and wishes the Headteacher, Mrs Claase, her team at St Mary&rsquo;s, parents, carers and all the pupils a very happy anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1454</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Creation of the Artist Rooms Collection</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the acquisition of the Artist Rooms collection by the National Galleries of Scotland and Tate on behalf of the nation; acknowledges that the acquisition will allow this internationally significant collection to be seen by audiences throughout Scotland and the United Kingdom; expresses its gratitude to Anthony d&rsquo;Offay for allowing the collection to be purchased at a fraction of its market value and agreeing to act as voluntary curator of the collection for five years, and acknowledges that this acquisition is an excellent example of what can be achieved through the co-operation of Scottish and UK institutions.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1452</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Choices for People Coming to the End of Terminal Illness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises and commends the committed work of all health professionals and carers who support patients with terminal illness; welcomes the advances in the palliative care movement over recent years that have benefited patients who are coming towards the end of terminal illness; further welcomes national campaigns to allow patients to be aware of choices that they can make about their treatment and facilitate more patients to make the choice of dying at home, but believes, however, that there remain patients who wish to have greater control of their treatment and that it is right to debate allowing greater legal support for the choices that some patients may make to ask for assistance to die as they come towards the end of their terminal illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1451#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Aerospace, Defence and Naval Sector - World Class</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Scottish Aerospace, Defence and Naval Industry - A Vision for the Future</em> by SBAC Scotland; recognises the value of the industry to Scotland; notes that there are 170 companies involved in the aerospace, defence and naval sector in Scotland, employing over 16,000 people and generating orders of &pound;2.31 billion in 2006; further recognises the success of shipbuilding on the Clyde, the thousands of jobs associated with the Scotstoun and Govan yards within BAE Systems  and the establishment of one of the largest apprenticeship schemes in Scotland; supports SBAC Scotland&rsquo;s aim of doubling the Scottish sector&rsquo;s annual sales over the next 15 years and further developing an already world-class industry, and considers that there should be positive engagement by government with SBAC Scotland and its member firms.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1450</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>North Lanarkshire Voluntary Sector Newsletter and Conference</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Volunteer Centre North Lanarkshire and CVS North Lanarkshire on their collaboration in producing the excellent North Lanarkshire Voluntary Sector Newsletter, which provides valuable information on a wide range of community and voluntary projects across North Lanarkshire and on training and development opportunities for those who are, or who would like to be, involved in them, and which focuses on the positive aspects of participating in community activities; notes the North Lanarkshire Voluntary Sector Conference on 28 February 2008 which offered a valuable networking and learning opportunity, and wishes all those involved in the voluntary sector in North Lanarkshire success and continuing fruitful collaboration in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1449</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Removal of Wardens from Sheltered Housing Complexes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision by North Ayrshire&rsquo;s Labour, Liberal Democrat and two Independent councillors to axe all of the wardens in its local authority sheltered housing complexes; is alarmed by the total lack of consultation with those reliant on the service and the wider public prior to this move; is aware that plans to remove the service are causing deep distress and anxiety to those vulnerable people who rely on this valuable resource such as elderly, blind and disabled people to make a saving of only &pound;285,000 despite the fact that it has millions of pounds in reserve and received an above inflation settlement for 2008 to 2011 inclusive; regrets that some of those councillors who took this decision, notably the Liberal Democrats, have attempted to evade responsibility for their actions by blaming the council tax freeze, and calls on North Ayrshire Council to suspend this decision until proper consultation can take place following on from which a further vote on this issue should be taken by the council as soon as possible.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-1444*#*</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson:</strong> <strong>Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that 23 March 2008 marks the first anniversary of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s signing of the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings; notes that this convention is yet to be ratified in order to enshrine the rights of victims of trafficking in domestic law; further notes that there are substantial responsibilities for the Scottish Government under this convention, including the identification of trafficking victims in line with services to victims of trafficking, the investigation and prosecution of trafficking and the non-prosecution of crimes that trafficking victims have been coerced into; believes that a lead should be taken in the UK on the implementation of the parts of the convention for which it has responsibility, and considers that all measures should be taken to stop this modern-day form of slavery.</p>
