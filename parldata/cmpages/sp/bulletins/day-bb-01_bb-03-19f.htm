            responsibility which local authorities have for flood prevention measures 
            and also the need for them to give consideration to possible flood 
            risks when considering planning applications; further notes that local 
            authorities have access to estimated 100 year flood maps provided 
            by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for this purpose but 
            is concerned that the scale of these maps, produced by the Institute 
            of Hydrology, is 1:50,000 and that they only provide information in 
            50 square metre blocks; urges the Scottish Executive to give consideration 
            to the effectiveness of these maps; believes that the Executive should 
            work with all local authorities to identify areas of flood risk which 
            are susceptible to flooding and to develop a national scheme to restrict 
            or prohibit development on &quot;at risk&quot; areas, and further 
            urges the Executive to produce a long term strategy for areas of development

            (ME) and/or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) including an estimated 
            two and a half thousand children, and asks the Scottish Executive 
            to commission urgently a strategic needs review assessment into ME

            care, and that use of a car is essential in carrying out that role; 
            believes that the practices of requiring these health workers to pay 
            parking charges in the course of their work, and of providing car 
            leasing arrangements on different terms in different Trusts, should 
            be reviewed in the interests of efficiency and equity, and further

            well as the 2008 European Nations Championship, and believes that 
            hosting these tournaments would be of great benefit to domestic football,

            documentary and oral sources of working people's history north of 
            the Border; further notes that the Trust receives no National Lottery 
            funding as it is revenue based, depends entirely on voluntary donations 
            and operates with only one part-time researcher and volunteers, yet 
            continues to produce invaluable work on the history of Scotland, and 
            is concerned at the threat for the future faced by other outlets dedicated

            Alex Salmond: Future of Fishing Industry</strong>—That the Parliament notes 
            the decision by Scottish fishing boats to tie-up in port as an attempt 
            to stop the slaughter of juvenile haddock and whiting; recognises 
            that the Cod Recovery Plan in closed fishing areas has forced the 
            fleet into fishing grounds which are teeming with juvenile fish which 
            when caught must be discarded dead back into the sea; further notes 
            that the future of the fishing industry depends on the survival of 
            these juvenile fish; deplores the fact that working fishermen, with 
            mortgages and financial commitments to meet, now apparently care more 
            for the conservation of fish stocks than the Scottish Executive or 
            Her Majesty's Government, and seeks the immediate introduction by 
            the Scottish Executive of a compensation lay-up scheme to allow the 
            industry to move through this difficult period and secure a future 
            for the white fish fisheries</font></p>

            on proposals for the future regulation of Technetium-99 discharges 
            from Sellafield, objects to the Environment Agency’s proposal to allow 
            Sellafield’s high discharges of Tc-99 to continue until at least 2006; 
            notes that Tc-99 remains dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years 
            and builds up in the food chain, particularly in lobsters; notes with 
            concern that lobsters are still being found in south-west Scotland 
            with levels of Tc-99 close to the European Community Intervention 
            Level (1,250 Bq/kg) after a nuclear accident, that levels in seaweed 
            range from 2,800 Bq/kg in south-west Scotland to 910 Bq/kg in Cape 
            Wrath and therefore that the whole of the west coast of Scotland and 
            beyond is contaminated with Tc-99; is concerned that British Nuclear 
            Fuels Limited (BNFL) is planning to increase discharges of Tc-99 and 
            many radioactive substances as a result of its plan to increase the 
            throughput of its MAGNOX reprocessing plant, contrary to the UK Government’s 
            stated intent to substantially reduce or eliminate these discharges; 
            believes that radioactive waste should be concentrated and contained 
            in monitorable and retrievable form rather than being diluted and 
            dispersed in the seas around Scotland, and therefore requests that 
            Government and the nuclear industry’s regulators should stop BNFL 
            producing any more liquid Tc-99 and other radioactive wastes by ending 
            MAGNOX reprocessing at Sellafield and closing BNFL’s MAGNOX reactors 
            and furthermore should stop BNFL discharging its existing liquid Tc-99 
            wastes into the sea by converting them into a solid form that can 
            be contained and shielded on the Sellafield site.</font></p>

            Ewing: Dentistry Services in Rural Scotland</strong>—That the Parliament 
            believes that the setting of the threshold for NHS commitment payments 
            to dentists at a gross earnings level of £25,000 a year penalises 
            those dentists who practice in remote parts of Scotland who are unable 
            to achieve the threshold earnings and therefore access the payment; 
            notes that local access to the services of a dentist in such parts 
            of Scotland is crucial but severely threatened by the current flat 
            rate threshold; urges the Scottish Executive to press for a reduced 
            threshold rate for those dentists operating in rural areas where it 
            cannot be expected, given their patient base, that the threshold will 
            ever be achieved and calls upon the Executive to ensure that people 
            living in rural Scotland and the islands of Scotland are able to access 
            NHS dental services locally.</font></p>

            McGugan: Robert Fergusson</strong>—That the Parliament recognises the significant 
            contribution of the 18th century poet Robert Fergusson to Scotland’s 
            literary heritage; notes that he continued the revival of writing 
            in the tongue of Lowland Scotland, which Allan Ramsay (1684-1758) 
            began in the years following the Treaty of Union; notes that this 
            in turn was taken up by Robert Burns, who had all but given up writing 
            poetry until he read Fergusson’s work and found it inspirational and 
            that in 1768, after his visit to Edinburgh, Burns commissioned a headstone 
            for Fergusson’s hitherto unmarked grave in Canongate Kirkyard, a material 
            symbol of his gratitude to the young makar; further notes that later 
            Robert Louis Stevenson gave instructions that the stone should be 
            repaired and re-inscribed because of the debt he also felt he owed 
            to Fergusson, and commends the &quot;Friends of Robert Fergusson&quot; 
            for their efforts to raise funds for the erection of a &quot;people 
            friendly&quot; statue in Edinburgh’s Royal Mile to commemorate this 
            poet whose importance to Scottish literature and particularly to poetry 
            in Scots, cannot be overstated.</font></p>

            in Cumnock and Doon Valley, reported at £16,500 compared to the UK

            Fund for the area; recognises, however, that to transform rather than

            across its Scottish produce base and to match any funding given by 
            the Executive to the creameries.</font></p>

            to the highest in Scotland and that, according to the City Council

            Framework Directive on the removal of water from rivers and water 
            courses and its potentially damaging effect on the Scotch whisky industry; 
            recognises that the industry is important to Scotland’s economy and 
            the many rural areas where distilleries are located; welcomes the 
            efforts made by representatives of all parties to convince the EU 
            to consider opt-outs for Scottish distilleries, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should apply immediately the exemptions from 
            the Directive in order to protect the jobs and livelihoods of those 
            working in the industry.</font></p>
