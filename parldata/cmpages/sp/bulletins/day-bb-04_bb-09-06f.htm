          <p><strong> * S2M-1638</strong> Christine Grahame:<strong>Hidden Treasure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in recognition of the historic and political significance of the &ldquo;Arniston&rdquo; stone, a 400- year-old lintel that was salvaged by Robert Dundas in the 1800s from the original Scottish Parliament, where it had formed part of the fa&ccedil;ade, and has been returned to the Parliament, its original home, by the current owner of Arniston House, calls for it to be moved from its current inconspicuous location to a place of significance above the public entrance for all to see.</p>
