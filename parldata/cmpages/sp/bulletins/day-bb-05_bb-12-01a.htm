<p><strong>S2M-3658</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Ambitious, Excellent Schools: One Year On</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that young people are one of Scotland&rsquo;s greatest resources; believes that every child is entitled to the opportunity to fulfil his or her full potential; notes the significant progress made over the last year by the Scottish Executive on the most comprehensive programme of modernisation in Scottish schools for a generation or more; supports the objectives set out in Ambitious, Excellent Schools; welcomes the emphasis on heightened expectations, stronger leadership, greater freedom for teachers and schools, increased choice and opportunity for pupils, better support for learning and more appropriate accountability, and supports the Executive&rsquo;s ongoing modernisation of Scotland&rsquo;s schools. </p>
<blockquote>

  <p><strong>S2M-3658.1</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Ambitious, Excellent Schools: One Year On</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3658) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;the significant progress&quot; to end and insert &quot;that all schools should be Schools of Ambition; notes the objectives set out in Ambitious, Excellent Schools and, in particular, the cultural emphasis of a number of the successful bids for schools of ambition status but, in doing so, notes the general concern that Scotland&rsquo;s culture, history and heritage lack national support from the Scottish Executive in the education system; notes with serious concern the proposals by the Executive to make history history in S1 and S2; asserts the importance of children in Scotland having a firm understanding and appreciation of Scottish heritage, culture and history; recognises and supports creative ways to weave this into every subject in the curriculum providing a Scottish perspective; rejects, however, any attempt to remove the stand-alone subject of history from S1 and S2 in schools in Scotland, and regrets any suggestion of this by any Scottish minister, reflecting that such a move would not be even countenanced in other countries who have a pride in promoting their nation&rsquo;s history.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-3658.2</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Ambitious, Excellent Schools: One Year On</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3658) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the aims of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s agenda in Ambitious, Excellent Schools; believes, however, that in order for each child to have the opportunity to reach his or her potential, the Executive must explore all avenues for supporting schools in providing the broadest range of subjects to stimulate the broad range of our children&rsquo;s aptitude and interest; notes that the Executive&rsquo;s schools modernisation programme, set out in <em>The 21st Century School, Building Our Future: Scotland&rsquo;s School Estate, </em>is leading to many valued rural primary schools being closed or amalgamated with other schools on new sites in the name of rationalisation; acknowledges that in order to achieve its professed aim of emphasising strong leadership and greater freedom for teachers, schools must be granted more genuine autonomy, and urges the Executive to consider education reforms of the sort being contemplated at Westminster, so that every school will be able to become a self-governing independent state school to give genuine choice and opportunity to all pupils.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>2.55 pm</strong>&#9;Executive Debate: Sea Fisheries&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-3657</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the Scottish Executive in its efforts to negotiate the best possible outcome from the EU Fisheries Council in December 2005, an outcome that delivers sustainable fisheries and a fair deal for Scotland&rsquo;s fishermen and fishing communities. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S2M-3657.2</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3657) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;notes that Scotland has achieved its effort reduction target for cod mortality in the North Sea; believes that Scotland must now be rewarded for this disproportionate sacrifice and that any further cuts in key stocks must be resisted; calls for the level of effort reduction achieved by other national fleets that fish Scottish waters to be made available; urges the Scottish Executive to help our fishing communities cope with rising costs such as for fuel and leasing quota; urges the Minister to include representatives from the fishing industry in his negotiating team to provide advice, and calls for Scotland to lead the UK negotiating team in Europe later this month and beyond, until control over our fishing grounds is returned to the Scottish Parliament.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S2M-3657.1</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank: Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3657) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &quot;an outcome&quot; to end and insert &quot;urges the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to press for significantly increased quotas for nephrops and monkfish, coupled with no reduction in haddock total allowable catch and the confirmation of the proposed pelagic quotas to secure a sustainable future for our remaining fishermen and processors, as well as for our beleaguered coastal communities, but ultimately believes that the only solution for the Scottish fishing industry is to leave the discredited Common Fisheries Policy and to regain national and local control of UK waters.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S2M-3657.3</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott: Sea Fisheries</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3657) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish Executive, beyond the December Council, to press for changes to the operation of the Common Fisheries Policy to support healthier and more sustainable seas through a broad range of measures complementary or alternative to total allowable catches, including marine protected areas, regeneration zones and on-board observers, and to consider bycatch quotas to address discards and the innovative use of European fisheries funds to support profitability and sustainability.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>&#9;</em><strong>S2M-3665</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Rule 9.6.3A</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees under Rule 9.6.3A that the Parliament shall consider the general principles of the Joint Inspection of Children&rsquo;s Services and Inspection of Social Work Services (Scotland) Bill on the third sitting day after the lead committee report is published.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong>&#9;Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>&#9;</em>Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3549</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Council Tax in Very Sheltered Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses astonishment and concern at the decision of the valuation boards in Renfrewshire and Lanarkshire to designate single rooms occupied by residents of very sheltered housing complexes, such as Abbeyfield Homes in Coatbridge, as being fully liable for council tax; furthermore notes that a review of this matter is currently being undertaken by the Scottish Executive; recognises that this injustice has to be rectified as a matter of urgency by redesignating each very sheltered housing complex as being liable for council tax as a whole rather than individual living units, and believes that any council tax payments made as a result of the current designation should be refunded.</p>
