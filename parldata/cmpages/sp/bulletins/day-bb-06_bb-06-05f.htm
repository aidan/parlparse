<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4493</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Scottish National Minimum Wage Helpline</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the failure of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to continue funding the Scottish National Minimum Wage Helpline which will have to close on 30 June 2006 following a successful pilot; notes that the helpline has helped 200 Scots to secure wage arrears of &pound;50,000 since January 2003 and assisted 3,000 callers to resolve wage issues, thus avoiding an official complaint against their employers; notes that the service is available to individuals both as employees and employers, Jobcentres, citizens advice bureaux and other local advice centres; further notes that it provides this at an annual cost of &pound;36,000 per annum, which is incidentally 1% of Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s overspend; recognises, while the DTI is pinch-penny, the cost-effective service that the helpline provides, and therefore considers that the Scottish government should provide this funding, particularly in light of the substantial support which, in contrast, it gives to Scottish Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4492</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>The Continuing Rise of Chlamydia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing rise in Chlamydia, in light of recent figures showing increases in eight of the fifteen NHS board areas, with the fastest rise occurring among the 16 to 19-years age group; notes that Chlamydia is the commonest treatable sexually transmitted infection in Scotland and that the majority of those infected have no symptoms; further notes that the Healthy Respect pilot in Lothian, which uses postal testing kits for Chlamydia, is yet to be extended to the rest of Scotland; notes also that, despite &pound;4.5 million funding given to NHS boards to help implement the national sexual health strategy, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde as the biggest health board does not plan to introduce Chlamydia postal testing kits and that this may impair the establishment of a national contract with NHS boards to  provide Chlamydia postal testing kits through a Scottish Executive bulk and shared purchasing arrangement, and calls on all NHS boards to implement the Scottish Executive Health Department&rsquo;s recommendation in the national sexual health strategy for postal testing kits for Chlamydia, and other sexually transmitted infections, to be introduced.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4491</strong> <strong>Ms Maureen Watt:</strong> <strong>Grand Prix Snooker in Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the return of top-class snooker to Aberdeen with the announcement of the Grand Prix World Snooker Tour event to be held in the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre in October 2006; considers that this event, along with the Aberdeen Cup tennis tournament which will be taking place for the second year running, marks out the north east as an excellent venue for high-class sporting events which will encourage more people to participate in sport, and hopes that other sporting bodies will take the opportunity to hold events in Aberdeen and the north east in future.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4490</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>90th Anniversary of the Easter Rising</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the annual James Connolly commemoration march through Edinburgh on 3 June 2006 takes place in the year of the 90th anniversary of the Easter rising; believes that James Connolly&rsquo;s part in the 1916 Dublin rising and his legacy to the struggle for freedom, national liberation and socialism, not just in Scotland and Ireland but throughout the world, should be much more widely recognised, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support new educational and cultural initiatives to bring greater understanding and clarity in respect of the hugely significant part that this native of Edinburgh played in events shaping the world of the early 20th century.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4489</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Ken Loach and Paul Laverty - Palme d&rsquo;Or Prize</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates director, Ken Loach, and scriptwriter, Paul Laverty, on the success of their latest film &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot; in winning the highly prestigious Palme d&rsquo;Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival; notes that the film, set during the Irish War of Independence and ensuing civil war of the 1920s, was shot on location in Glasgow, and agrees with remarks made by Ken Loach on accepting the prize that &quot;our film is a little step in the British confronting their imperialist history. If we tell the truth about the past, maybe we&rsquo;ll tell the truth about the present.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4488</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Northfield Nuggets School Paper</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils and staff of Northfield Academy for the publication of <em>Northfield Nuggets</em>, its first school newspaper to be published for 13 years, and commends Aberdeen City Council for providing the resources for this initiative from its small grants fund.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4487</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>The Draft Scotland Act 1998 (River Tweed) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Environment and Rural Development Committee recommends that the draft Scotland Act 1998 (River Tweed) Order 2006 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4484</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Maid of the Loch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the Loch Lomond Steamship Company in its efforts to make the Maid of the Loch seaworthy; notes that the ship was built in 1953 and is registered as a historic vessel, but was taken out of commission in 1981 and has since been moored at Balloch; recognises that in 2005 the Loch Lomond Steamship Company rebuilt the slipway in order for the ship to be taken out of the water to assess what work must be undertaken for it to become seaworthy again; considers that tourism is vital to the local economy and that the Maid of the Loch would further enhance the reputation of local attractions; congratulates all those volunteers who have been involved in fund-raising and the preservation of the ship, and believes that one day soon the Maid of the Loch will sail again.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4483</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Animal Testing of Drugs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in common with Europeans for Medical Progress, expresses its concerns regarding the safeguarding of public health through data obtained from laboratory animals, particularly in light of large numbers of serious and fatal adverse drug reactions that were not predicted by animal studies; is concerned that the government has not commissioned or evaluated any formal research on the efficacy of animal experiments and has no plans to do so, and, in common with over 80% of general practitioners in a recent survey, calls on the government to facilitate an independent and transparent scientific evaluation of the use of animals as surrogate humans in drug safety testing and medical research.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4482</strong> <strong>Des McNulty on behalf of the Finance Committee:</strong> <strong>Cross-cutting Expenditure Review of Deprivation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recommendations contained in the Finance Committee&rsquo;s 5th Report, 2006 (Session 2): <em>Cross-cutting Expenditure Review of Deprivation </em>(SP paper 536).</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4481</strong> <strong>Alex Neil on behalf of the Enterprise and Culture Committee:</strong> <strong>Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Enterprise and Culture Committee considers the Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2 in the following order: Part 2, Part 14, Part 1, Parts 3 to 13, Parts 15 to 16; and that each schedule is considered immediately after the section that introduces it.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christine May</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4480</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Scottish Government and Scottish Ministers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the use of the term &quot;Scottish Executive&quot; is misleading and confuses the Liberal/Labour government with the Scottish Parliament and, in particular, allowed the Liberal Democrats in the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election successfully to masquerade as being in opposition on issues such as hospital closures, transport and education; notes that section 44 of the Scotland Act 1998 states that &quot;(1) There shall be a Scottish Executive, whose members shall be (a) the First Minister, and (b) such Ministers as the First Minister may appoint&quot; and that &quot;(2) The members of the Scottish Executive are referred to collectively as the Scottish Ministers&quot;; further notes that parliamentary questions may be directed to the First Minister, and considers that as the terms &quot;Scottish Executive&quot; and &quot;Scottish Ministers&quot; are synonymous the Scottish government should be able to answer questions put down to &quot;Scottish Ministers&quot;.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4479</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>World No Tobacco Day 2006: &quot;Tobacco Deadly in any form or disguise&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Wednesday 31 May 2006 as World No Tobacco Day which is the only established global event to draw attention to the impact of tobacco use on the public&rsquo;s health and helps to reduce tobacco dependence, while encouraging countries and governments to work towards strict regulation of tobacco products; believes that Scotland has taken a major step forward by introducing a ban on smoking in public places which has given workers and others the benefit of a clean working environment, and hopes that the ban will encourage many smokers to kick the habit.</p>

<p>Supported by: Hugh Henry</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4465</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Trade Union Freedom Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that free and independent trade unions are a force for good in UK society and around the world and are vital to democracy; welcomes the positive role which modern unions play in providing protection for working people and winning fairness at work; notes that the 1906 Trades Disputes Act granted unions the legal freedom to take industrial action; regrets that successive anti-union legislation has meant that trade union rights are now weaker than those introduced by the Trades Disputes Act; notes the overwhelming support at both the Trades Union Congress and Labour Party Conference for the Gate Gourmet workers and for improvements in union rights, including measures to simplify ballot procedures and to allow limited supportive action, following a ballot, in specific&nbsp;circumstances; further notes that these conferences called for legislation which conforms to International Labour Organisation conventions ratified by the United Kingdom, and therefore welcomes the decision of the 2005 Trades Union&nbsp;Congress to campaign for a trade union freedom Bill to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1906 Trades Disputes Act.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4463</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Football Clubs and Community Involvement</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the good work done in their communities by leading football clubs in using their names to attract fans to take part in courses to educate young people about the dangers of drugs and alcohol, to develop a more positive attitude to school among pupils who are currently disaffected, to encourage and equip long-term unemployed people to start employment, to reduce sectarian and racist prejudices and to motivate many young people through football coaching to be more active and positive; believes that these good projects should be vigorously developed across the whole country by drawing on the enthusiasm and loyalty that football clubs arouse to motivate many more people to take part in these schemes, and further believes that the clubs, voluntary organisations, local authorities and the Scottish Executive should co-operate to provide and promote these benefits to individuals and to the community, bringing together the skills and energies of all those involved and the attraction of the club&rsquo;s name, and that the Executive should carefully target more financial resources directly to these projects.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr Brian Monteith</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4462</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Impact of Water Rates on Charities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the impact of the liability to pay full water rates incurred by charities which did not occupy their premises prior to 1999; notes that many charities simply cannot afford this size of bill, and believes that the Scottish Executive should examine ways of assisting charities facing this kind of difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4461</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Community Councils</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that community councils play a vital role in Scotland&rsquo;s democracy and should receive adequate funding and professional support to enable them to fulfil their role.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr David Davidson, Shiona Baird, Nora Radcliffe, Ms Maureen Watt</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4460</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Greentrax</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Greentrax Recordings, &quot;Scotland&rsquo;s Favourite Record Company&quot;, on its 20th anniversary; welcomes the recognition of founder, Ian Green, by the academic board of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in its award to him of the honorary degree of Doctor of Music; thanks Ian Green and all at Greentrax Recordings for their work in the preservation and promotion of Scottish traditional music and contribution to our nation&rsquo;s culture, and looks forward to many more years of great music.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Matheson</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4459</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Proposal for New Incinerators</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the six strategic outline cases (SOCs), plans for municipal waste, that have been submitted by Strategic Operation Review Groups (SORGs) of local authorities for approval by the Scottish Executive to proceed to outline business case; notes the two outline business cases currently under development; notes with concern that all but one group of local authorities propose the incineration of waste and that the scale of incineration proposals, totalling two million tonnes, is far greater than that proposed in Scotland&rsquo;s 2003 National Waste Plan; notes that an extensive and inclusive process was undertaken to establish 11 area waste plans each containing a best practicable environmental option for dealing with waste; is aware that incineration risks encouraging the generation of waste because incinerators require to process certain volumes of waste in order to remain viable; is aware that incineration results in loss of potentially useful materials at the same time as encouraging further resource depletion through use of virgin raw materials;  is aware that incineration can cause pollution, including from dioxins, affecting neighbouring communities; is aware that energy from mixed waste should not be regarded as a renewable energy source as it relies on a non-renewable fuel source; understands that incineration reduces the potential for creating jobs in recycling and waste minimisation; believes that any sustainable approach to waste management must acknowledge the top-down &quot;reduce &ndash; reuse &ndash; recycle&quot; hierarchy and that waste minimisation and recycling are the more environmentally and socially sustainable ways of dealing with waste; recognises that many of the SOCs proposed include recycling and waste production rates which contradict commitments made in the 2003 National Waste Plan to stabilise waste generation by 2010 and recycle 55% of waste by 2020, and therefore urges Scottish Ministers to request that those SORGs which contradict the National Waste Plan&rsquo;s best practicable environmental option review their SOCs to make them compatible with it.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4458</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Science Base, a Cause for Concern</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern, following the closure of the world-renowned Hannah Research Institute, that further decisions of a similar nature may be taken that will damage Scotland&rsquo;s science base and that failure to exercise due responsibility of care for the nation&rsquo;s core scientific capability will impact adversely on future economic prosperity in addition to undermining the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s ability to make scientifically informed decisions.</p>
<p>Supported by: Mr David Davidson, Mr Brian Monteith</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4457</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>School Environment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the environment in which many of our children, young people and teachers learn and teach is not always conducive to ensuring the best learning conditions; accepts that poor school environments are a direct result of following a policy of building schools under PPP initiatives and under-investment in the fabric of existing schools, instead of investing in properly built and maintained schools financed under the public sector; notes that students and teachers deserve the best conditions possible in which to learn and teach, including buildings in which facilities exist to monitor and control temperatures, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to initiate an immediate review of school building conditions and the installation of temperature monitoring and control systems.</p>
<p>Supported by: Colin Fox</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4228#</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Muscular Dystrophy &quot;My Life&quot; Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that there are 3,000 people in Scotland with inherited neuromuscular disorders and muscular dystrophy; is concerned that in Cumbernauld &amp; Kilsyth, whilst some constituents tell of good provision of electric wheelchairs and praise the staff delivering social services care, some have never received a full needs assessment of their home environment and can only experience care services delivered via an inflexible system weighted towards older people that does not accommodate the lifestyle that other young people are able to enjoy; notes that this is an example of the variation in standards and availability of care, service and equipment provision across Scotland; supports the work of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign in pioneering the search for treatments and cures for over 40 years, whilst also providing practical, professional and emotional support for people affected by neuromuscular conditions; in particular, supports the Muscular Dystrophy &quot;My Life&quot; campaign and its work in Scotland to encourage a co-ordinated approach by local authorities and NHS boards when assessing individuals&rsquo; needs and requirements, and considers the findings of the &quot;My Life&quot; expert group to be a model for future delivery of services to people affected by neuromuscular conditions.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3971#</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Mental Health and Deaf and Deafblind People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges and supports the campaign by the Scottish Council on Deafness (SCoD) for equal access to mainstream and specialist mental health services for deaf and deafblind people in Scotland; notes the widespread lack of provision for deaf and deafblind people who have specific language and communication needs and that presently their rights under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Scotland Act 2003 and Disability Discrimination Act 2005 are not being met, leading to misdiagnosis and unsuitable treatments being applied; further notes with concern the complete lack of consultant psychiatrists in Scotland who are trained and experienced to work with deaf and deafblind people who have mental health problems and that the nearest available specialist mental health service for deaf and deafblind inpatients is Manchester whose outreach service, which is currently used by Scots deaf and deafblind people, is now under threat of closure; endorses the campaign for a specialist mental health service for deaf and deafblind people in Scotland, funded through the NHS, and SCoD&rsquo;s aim of providing support for training and recruiting of deaf and deafblind people to enable them to work with deaf and deafblind patients; backs SCoD&rsquo;s call for additional resourcing for mainstream psychiatric services in both hospital and community settings which would lead to greater accessibility for deaf and deafblind people with mental health problems, and recommends the establishment of a specialist Scottish centre for deaf and deafblind people with mental health problems in the south of Scotland or other suitable region.</p>
