          <p><strong>*S2M-1195</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Private 
            Prisons</strong>-That the Parliament notes the important progress 
            that has been made by the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) &quot;Bridging 
            the Gap&quot; project and, in particular, the constructive relationship 
            that has developed between the SPS and trade union partners to bid 
            for a second new prison; regrets the decision by the Scottish Executive 
            to contract out the first new build prison to the private sector, 
            therefore denying the public sector the opportunity to openly compete 
            for an important public sector service, and calls on the Executive 
            to reconsider this decision.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1194#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Recognition 
            of Jack Vettriano</strong>-That the Parliament notes the increasing 
            popularity, both at home and abroad, of the Fife-born and bred artist 
            Jack Vettriano; notes the sale by auction of his most recognised work, 
            &quot;The Singing Butler&quot;, for a record amount for a painting 
            sold in Scotland by a Scottish artist; notes with dismay that not 
            one of his works appears in any of our national galleries, and believes 
            that at least one of his paintings should be obtained by one of our 
            national institutions to recognise his contemporary popularity and 
            national significance.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Christine May<strong>*</strong>, Janis Hughes<strong>*</strong>, 
            Rhona Brankin<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1193</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>St 
            Andrew's Church of Scotland, Gibraltar</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that May 2004 marks the 150th anniversary of the opening of 
            St Andrew's Church of Scotland, Gibraltar; recognises the valuable 
            contribution that the church makes to the lives of members of the 
            British military population and other expatriates in Gibraltar, and 
            wishes it success with the numerous events that it has planned this 
            year to celebrate the anniversary.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1192</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Three 
            New Primary Schools in the Falkirk Area</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates Falkirk Council on its decision to build three new primary 
            schools at Stenhousemuir, Larbert and Maddiston; notes that these 
            three new schools will be built without the use of PPP/PFI, and welcomes 
            the fact that the new schools will be owned by the residents of Falkirk 
            District, unlike the five schools built by the previous New Labour 
            administration.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1191</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Joint 
            Marine Programme - The Tangle of the Clyde Report</strong>-That the 
            Parliament welcomes the report by the Joint Marine Programme, <em>The 
            Tangle of the Clyde</em>, revealing the historic mismanagement of 
            the Firth of Clyde and highlighting the tangled web of conflicting 
            and confusing legislation that affects all of Scotland's seas and 
            coasts; notes the unacceptable free-for-all, rather than coherent 
            legal basis, by which the seas are managed; notes the importance of 
            the seas to the Scottish economy; supports the call for a Marine Act 
            for Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take on board 
            the results of this new report in its current consultation on the 
            marine environment in the interests of protecting and restoring both 
            marine life and the livelihoods of coastal communities.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1190</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Borders 
            Adult Learner and Students Association</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes Adult Learners' Week as a recognition of the value of learning 
            opportunities across all age groups for individuals and society; applauds 
            those who overcome personal challenges in accessing learning opportunities 
            in adulthood; is aware that there are many reasons why such opportunities 
            are accessed, for example personal or career development; recognises 
            that there are significant barriers to such access, for example transport, 
            accessing childcare and cost; congratulates Borders Adult Learner 
            and Students Association (BALSA) on raising the profile of adult learning 
            in the Borders, and is pleased to acknowledge BALSA's conference on 
            Saturday 8 May 2004 as the start of the process of breaking down the 
            barriers to accessing adult learning opportunities.</P>
