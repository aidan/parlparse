<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7085&diams;   Jim Tolson: Renewable Energy Skills Training</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Carnegie College, Dunfermline, for being at the forefront of green energy skills development through its provision of renewable energy skills training and the wind energy industry&rsquo;s first pilot wind turbine technician apprenticeship programme; considers that the college plays an important role in providing vocational education in the area and that the engineering and energy sector represents a huge opportunity for Fife and Scotland; believes that this far-sighted project will put the college at the centre of developing the high-quality training needed to support renewable energy industries, ensuring that Scotland meets its considerable green energy potential and bringing jobs and long-term sustainable growth; believes that the renewables industry has the potential to create thousands of new jobs for Fife and Central Scotland, and considers that Fife can become a major contributor to the development of the renewable energy capacity of the east of Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7084 Mr Frank McAveety: Congratulations to St Joan of Arc School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the achievement of St Joan of Arc School in the Tollcross area of Glasgow in being the first secondary school in Glasgow to achieve the permanent Eco-school Award as part of the Green Flag initiative; considers that there has been a tremendous commitment to, and passion for, the project over the past eight years by the school&rsquo;s staff and students, and is confident that the school will serve as an example for others in the area to follow and that this award demonstrates a commitment to the sustainability of the environment.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7082 Elaine Smith: Best Small City</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates North Lanarkshire Council for its horticultural investment in Coatbridge and the surrounding areas, which, in 2010, has led to the town being named the Best Small City for the second year in a row of the Beautiful Scotland campaign; recognises that the judges considered the town to be a vibrant, up-and-coming community; considers also that praise was lavished on the local nature reserve in Gartcosh and the new structure in Glenboig Community Park, which were considered to be a good quality interpretation of the area&rsquo;s industrial past; believes that the whole community played a part in winning the award, and commends North Lanarkshire Council for their continuing investment to enhance and regenerate the area and its facilities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7081 Joe FitzPatrick: University of Dundee World Rankings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the University of Dundee on being included in the top 200 world universities ranked by the <em>Times Educational Supplement</em>; understands that this year&rsquo;s rankings were undertaken under a new and more thorough methodology, which places more emphasis on hard measures of excellence in all three core elements of a university&rsquo;s mission - research, teaching and knowledge transfer; further notes that the university has been described by <em>The Sunday Times</em> as &quot;an institution regarded as one of the success stories of British higher education&quot;, which has already been ranked top in the world for research impact in pharmacology by Thomson Reuters and elected Europe&rsquo;s &quot;best place to work in academia&quot; in the annual worldwide survey compiled by <em>The Scientist</em> magazine, and wishes the staff and students all the very best in continuing to move the bar of human knowledge and further both Dundee and Scotland&rsquo;s reputations worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7080 Rob Gibson: Celebrate 80% Clean Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes findings from an independent study commissioned by Renewable Scotland that suggest that Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy output in the next 10 years could rise to 80%; notes what it considers to be the great potential of Scottish renewable output and echoes the calls contained in the report for investment on a massive scale in the industry and for it to have maximum support from all levels of government, and calls on the UK Government to end what are believed to be the discriminatory transmission charges and release the Scottish fossil levy funds to the Scottish Government which, it believes, will allow the renewable sector in Scotland to grow further and flourish.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7079 Pauline McNeill: Israeli Flotilla Raid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the Israeli raid on the Gaza-bound flotilla during which 9 people were killed; recognises that Israel&rsquo;s actions were found to be in breach of international law by the United Nations Human Rights Council; acknowledges the report&rsquo;s finding that the violence used was disproportionate and unacceptable; notes with deepest concern that Israel has refused to accept this judgement, and calls for further action from the international community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7078 Bill Kidd: Another Successful Year for Dumbarton Road Corridor Addiction Forum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its congratulations to Dumbarton Road Corridor (DRC) Addiction Forum on what it considers another successful year of activity and the publication of its 2009-10 annual report; welcomes that the forum was one of many organisations across Scotland increasing opportunities for young people to benefit from Scottish Government CashBack for Communities funds; further congratulates the DRC Addiction Forum Peer Educators on winning the <em>Evening Times</em> Community Championship Award in the last year; commends all the volunteers and staff for their dedication and hard work in making a real difference to the lives of DRC Addiction Forum service users, and wishes them all continuing success in the coming year and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7077 Bill Wilson: Cuts Will Worsen One of the Worst Places in Europe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with dismay that, according to uSwitch.com&rsquo;s <em>Quality of Life Index</em>, the United Kingdom is one of the worst places to live in Europe in 2010, with relatively low investment in health and education, the highest prices for food and diesel, more time spent in the office per week and disposable income falling behind that of residents of other countries; notes that this survey has been published just as the UK Government is proposing what is considered to be a regressive rise in VAT and massive cuts to public spending; believes that such cuts can only worsen the quality of life for most UK citizens; welcomes, however, what it considers to be positive signals from Liberal Democrat members of the coalition with regard to clamping down on tax cheats and scrapping nuclear weapons, and believes that a rigorous approach to tax avoidance, evasion and non-payment and eliminating the UK&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal offers a more positive and economically logical way to tackle the public deficit.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7076 David Whitton: Congratulations to Medical Research Council - University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success of the Medical Research Council - University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR) in securing &pound;4.8 million from the Wellcome Trust and Wolfson Foundation to build a new laboratory on the Garscube Campus; congratulates Professor Massimo Palmarini, a vet by training and recently appointed director of the CVR, and his colleagues in the CVR on winning the award, and, finally, looks forward to seeing the CVR develop into a medical research centre of international renown that will strengthen Scotland&rsquo;s scientific expertise in both animal and human viruses.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7073 David Stewart: Sensible Driving, Always Arriving</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the website initiative being run in Wales called Deadly Mates, which is aimed at encouraging safer driving among young people; believes that, following several fatal road collisions involving young people in the Highlands, urgent action needs to be taken to reduce the deaths of young people on all of Scotland&rsquo;s roads; supports the calls to introduce measures to ensure that young people drive more safely, including a mandatory display of a P-plate for 90 days after successful completion of a driving test, limiting the size of a car&rsquo;s engine to be driven by people under 25 and introducing a graduated licence scheme that incorporates night driving, motorway driving and driving observation, and urges the Scottish Executive and the Department for Transport to work together to consider implementing these measures to ensure that no more young people are needlessly killed or seriously injured on Scotland&rsquo;s roads.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7072&diams;   Bill Kidd: Scotland&rsquo;s Nuclear Weapons-free Zones</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that New Zealand has set a good example with the establishment of a succession of nuclear weapons-free zones; would welcome the establishment of such zones in Scotland in homes, classrooms, places of work, communities, local authorities and in the environs of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, with the aim to register Scotland as a single-state nuclear weapons-free zone with the United Nations, and would further welcome the development of a protocol for Scotland requesting that the nuclear weapons states honour such a zone by not deploying nuclear weapons on Scottish territory and by guaranteeing not to threaten or use nuclear weapons against Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7071 John Wilson: Coatbridge Wins Best Small City Award for Second Year in a Row</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Coatbridge on winning the Best Small City title for the second year in a row in the Beautiful Scotland campaign; recognises that Coatbridge progressed to Silver Gilt standard in this years&rsquo; campaign; applauds that Coatbridge will now be entered into next year&rsquo;s UK-wide Britain in Bloom campaign, which is considered a major achievement for a town that has taken part in the Beautiful Scotland campaign for only two years; praises both Gartcosh Community Council and Glenboig Neighbourhood House for winning Neighbourhood Awards in 2009, and recognises the hard work of the local community in maintaining these excellent standards.</p>

<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7069 Marilyn Livingstone: Deferral of Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with serious concern the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to defer the entry into force of the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010 from 1 October 2010 to 1 April 2011; considers that there is opposition to all ship-to-ship transfers of oil in the Forth Estuary on an all-party basis by Fife Council, by business leaders, environmental organisations and community groups; considers that an unacceptably short space of time was allocated for the consultation period on the amendments to the regulations; believes that it was unfortunate that the consultation document was not circulated to MSPs when they represented the concerns of their local environmental and community groups and persuaded the Scottish Government to introduce environmental regulations to try to safeguard the Forth Estuary from possible pollution from ship-to-ship transfers, and supports calls for the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010 to be introduced on 1 October 2010 as planned.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7068 Jim Hume: 2010 Business Rates, Revaluation, Dumfries and Galloway</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the concerns of the Dumfries and Galloway Chamber of Commerce following this year&rsquo;s business rates revaluation; considers that the rates set on 1 April 2008 failed to take into account the impact of the recession; further notes that the Scottish Government has removed transitional relief, which has resulted in rates increases of up to 200% for some businesses; understands that transitional relief has been retained in England and that Northern Ireland has abandoned the 2010 revaluation altogether; acknowledges the views of the chamber of commerce that the reintroduction of transitional relief is necessary to support businesses; calls on the Scottish Government to conduct an urgent review of the rating appeals process to ensure that businesses have the means to appeal unrealistic rating valuations, and further calls on the Scottish Government to do all that it can to support businesses in Dumfries and Galloway that have been unfairly affected by the revaluation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7067 John Park: Welcoming the Whitlock Energy Collaboration Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of the Whitlock Energy Collaboration Centre at Carnegie College in Dunfermline, which will focus on research and development for Scotland&rsquo;s growing renewable energy sector; gives thanks to Robert M Buchan, who has donated $1 million Canadian to endow the new college; welcomes the naming of the centre in honour of Colin and Rene Whitlock of Limekilns; celebrates the contribution that Colin Whitlock made to the electronic revolution of the 1960s and his dedication to vocational training; congratulates Professor Bill McIntosh and all at Carnegie College on launching the new centre and more generally on securing the college&rsquo;s status as one of Scotland&rsquo;s leading colleges in engineering and energy; looks forward to the future work of the Whitlock centre, which will be at the hub of the engineering campus, providing 1,000 square metres of dedicated space for the renewable sector that will include a demonstration lab and exhibition area, and recognises the importance of the establishment of this centre within the broader context of the need to invest sustainably green skills and technology for Scotland&rsquo;s future.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7050 Bill Wilson: Westminster Thinking on Science Not Just Wrong, But Mad</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes<em> New Scientist&rsquo;s</em> editorial of 15 September 2010, <em>Don&rsquo;t let Britain&rsquo;s politicians ruin science</em>, in which Professor Robert M May, former Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government, criticises the UK Government&rsquo;s attitude towards science; agrees with Professor May that Vince Cable&rsquo;s &quot;crude advocacy of more commercially related research showed little awareness of the complex interplay between basic research - new ideas - and their translation into products&quot; and, that money put into basic research &quot;is not a cost but an investment&quot;; notes that the proposed UK Government cuts in science funding come at a time when the United States has announced a $21 billion boost for science as part of a stimulus package, France is investing &euro;35 billion and Germany and China are also supporting science, and believes that the UK&rsquo;s pre-eminent position in terms of the quantity and quality of its scientific research, which puts it in what is considered to be a unique competitive position, must be maintained, and that, as Professor May expresses it, &quot;the current thinking is not just wrong, it&rsquo;s mad&quot;.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7050.1 Liam McArthur: Westminster Thinking on Science Not Just Wrong, But Mad</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7050) in the name of Bill Wilson, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes <em>New Scientist&rsquo;s</em> editorial of 15 September 2010, <em>Don&rsquo;t let Britain&rsquo;s politicians ruin science</em>; regrets that Professor Robert M May&rsquo;s article did not include an analysis of the situation in Scotland, where serious concerns have been raised by the Moredun Research Institute and others about the SNP government&rsquo;s approach to future scientific research funding in areas where Scotland has a global lead, including in infectious disease research and animal health; considers that specialist research facilities and centres such as Moredun have a world-renowned reputation and are making significant contributions to the economy in terms of jobs and training young people in relevant skills; notes concerns raised that Moredun may be forced to dilute its focus on infectious disease and move into other areas of research, potentially compromising its capability to contribute most effectively to the Scottish and UK economy, and considers it hypocritical of SNP members to attack the UK administration while it is believed that the Scottish Government risks squandering the specialist scientific excellence that delivers real economic value for Scotland by pursuing a lowest common denominator in scientific research, threatening to replace world-class empirical research with desk-based social science analysis.&quot;</p>
