            <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission 
            must have unimpeded access to all Crown Office papers and relevant 
            evidence in relation to any case which the Commission is investigating; 
            believes that access to requested papers and associated evidence is 
            essential for the Commission to operate as a genuinely independent 
            and credible investigatory body able to uncover miscarriages of justice, 
            and considers that the Crown Office must release all relevant papers 
            requested by the Criminal Cases Review Commission without condition 
            or impediment.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial"><strong>*S1M-1112</strong> <strong>Dorothy-Grace 
            Elder: Sex Offenders Register</strong>-That the Parliament demands the 
            immediate setting up of a comprehensive register of sex offenders 
            including those who escaped being registered because of being sentenced 
            before the current register was introduced in 1997; notes with alarm 
            that the estimated number of paedophiles, rapists and other sex criminals 
            living in the Scottish community, unregistered and unchecked, is between 
            6,000 and 13,000; demands immediate extra funding for the police to 
            assist their work on an unofficial register which they are compiling 
            until this can be turned legally into an official register; requests 
            that forms of protection for children be investigated immediately, 
            including electronic tagging of paedophiles and special marks on passports; 
            declares that current protection levels for children are totally inadequate, 
            from lack of provision for Justice Social Workers who check on sex 
            offenders, to lack of aid to ChildLine and extreme shortages of funding 
            for police for the harrowing work they do in this area; acknowledges 
            that it is totally unacceptable that parents live in an era of fear 
            for their children on a daily basis, and declares that it has fewer 
            greater priorities than the protection of children and is willing 
            to back that aim with funding and active work by members.</font></p>

            railway investment over the next ten years, in implementation of the 
            Parliament's commitment to reinstating the Borders Railway from Edinburgh 
            to Carlisle in terms of motion S1M-922, and given the Executive's

            calls upon the Scottish Executive in its directions and guidance to
