            of Power Generation at Chapelcross - The World's Oldest Operational 
            Nuclear Power Station</strong>-That the Parliament notes with regret 
            the formal announcement that the Chapelcross Power Station, the longest-serving 
            nuclear power station in the world, has ceased power generation, having 
            provided a safe and reliable supply of electricity to the south of 
            Scotland since 1959; believes that the engineering and scientific 
            accomplishments of designing, building and operating Chapelcross and 
            Calder Hall in Cumbria were the 20th century equivalent of the Forth 
            Rail Bridge or the invention of the steam engine and congratulates 
            the management and workforce on their skill and dedication in operating 
            successfully the Calder Hall and Chapelcross power stations for a 
            combined total of more than 90 years; further notes the fudge and 
            delay inherent in Her Majesty's Government's energy policy; expresses 
            concern at the prospects of a looming &quot;energy gap&quot; in the 
            United Kingdom that cannot realistically be filled by renewable sources, 
            and believes that the success of Chapelcross would be best recognised 
            by the early commissioning of a replacement nuclear power facility 
            on the same site.</P>
