<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#9;Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-1331</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Anorexia and Bulimia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with unease that it is estimated that more than 80,000 people in Scotland suffer from anorexia, with 4,700 suffering from bulimia, and that the number of people diagnosed with eating disorders has increased by more than 15% since 1999, according to NHS Scotland; further notes that Eating Disorders Awareness Week takes place from 25 February to 1 March 2008; is aware that, despite guidelines issued by the health service watchdog in November 2006, Scotland still trails behind the rest of the western world in the treatment of eating disorders; is aware that the foremost expert on anorexia and bulimia in the United Kingdom, Bryan Lask, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of London, has voiced concern that the system for treating those with eating disorders in Scotland is &quot;positively dangerous&quot;; regrets that there is still no specific advice for GPs, despite every practice having patients suffering from eating disorders, and that only two private clinics in Edinburgh and Glasgow provide specialist care at a cost of around &pound;3,000 per patient per week; believes there should be examination of why there is not one consultant specialising in eating disorders employed by the NHS in Scotland and that consideration should be given to how best to tackle this problem which can prove fatal and is deeply distressing both for patients and their families, and understands the need for ongoing research into eating disorders and their treatment. </p>
