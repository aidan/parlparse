    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-783#</b> <strong>Margaret Jamieson: Meares-Irlen Syndrome</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes that research shows that up to 30% of children may be suffering from
    Meares-Irelen syndrome, which often results in reading difficulties affecting their
    education but which can be alleviated for many by the simple and cost effective use of
    appropriate coloured overlays, and calls upon education authorities and health boards to
    work in partnership to provide a comprehensive screening programme in order to ensure that
    all children can take full advantage of the education provided and go on to achieve their
    full potential in society. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-782#</b> <strong>Nick Johnston: Plight of Blairingone Residents</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with concern the plight of the residents of Blairingone in the
    constituency of Ochil who have for years been subjected to noise, dust, pollution and
    inconvenience from opencast coal workings and are now exposed to noxious smells and health
    hazards from the dumping of sewage and abattoir waste, and further notes with concern the
    failure of planning legislation to protect this community and the inadequacies of
    environmental protection legislation to safeguard the village of Blairingone.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-781</b> <strong>Mr Michael McMahon: Hamilton Academical Football Club</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with concern the decision by the Scottish Football League to deduct
    fifteen points from Hamilton Academical Football Club for failing to fulfil its fixture
    against Stenhousemuir on 1 April 2000; recognises the implications of such a severe
    reprimand for the club in terms of relegation to Division Three, for the fans and for the
    town of Hamilton, and calls upon the Scottish Football League to review its decision.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Donald Gorrie<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-780</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Law Commission Evidence</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with concern the decision of the Law Commission to refuse access to the
    evidence submitted to its enquiry on poindings and warrant sales; believes that this is
    contrary to the spirit of the Freedom of Information Bill published by the Executive, and
    agrees that the evidence submitted should be made freely available to the Parliament
    immediately.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-779#</b> <strong>Mr John McAllion: Lord Advocate and Freedom of
    Information</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the importance of maintaining the
    independence of the Lord Advocate and the Crown Office in relation to criminal proceedings
    in Scotland; recognises that justice must be seen to be done, and agrees that free access
    should be allowed for the families of victims, such as Mr and Mrs Crossan of Dundee, to
    all relevant police files, forensic reports and other documents pertaining to the case
    involving their family member.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-778</b> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Assisted Area Map</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes that the consultation period for representations to The Scotland Office
    in relation to the revised Assisted Area Status map ends on the 2 May; further notes that
    from the revised map substantial parts of the Highlands and Islands in Inverness, Nairn,
    Moray, Badenoch and Strathspey have been removed; agrees with the Highlands and Islands
    Enterprise and the Highland Council&#146;s assessment that the removal of these areas from
    the Assisted Area Map will be damaging to the whole economy of the Highlands and Islands
    and to the job prospects of thousands of people living within the Highlands and Islands,
    including those who face impending redundancy, and urges the relevant authorities to
    reconsider the matter and to reinstate excluded areas. </p>

    Winnie Ewing*, Mr John Munro*</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-777</b> <strong>Mr John McAllion: Post-Code Prescribing</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament recognises the need for a national policy over availability and prescription of
    drugs and treatments in the NHS, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that all
    treatments deemed to be beneficial by the Health Technology Board are equally funded
    throughout Scotland thereby ending the practice known as &quot;post-code
    prescribing&quot;.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">*S1M-772.1</b> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales
    Bill</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-772) in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave out
    from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;<strong> </strong>notes that the Scottish Executive will:-</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">(a) during the 2001/02 Parliamentary year bring forward legislation to
      introduce a new system to:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left">(i) abolish the present system of poindings and warrant sales which in
        many of its aspects is archaic and inhumane and replace it with a modern system that
        protects those who can&#146;t pay, ending the indignities they suffer, and supports the
        interests of those who pay their bills regularly;</p>
        <p align="left">(ii) ensure that those who can pay but won&#146;t are rigorously pursued,
        including for debts incurred in the course of business;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">(b) in the meantime, introduce secondary legislation to expand the list of
      goods exempt from domestic poindings and warrant sales; and </p>
      <p align="left">(c) establish a working group to consult widely and develop proposals for
      reforming the law of diligence against moveables, including proposals for debtor
      protection and debt arrangement schemes;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">and for these reasons, while agreeing to the principle of abolition of the
    poindings and warrant sales system, does not agree to the general principles of the
    Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill.&quot;</p>
