          <p>9.30 am&#9;Debate on Modernising Primary Care in NHS Scotland to 
            Improve Health-</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3022</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Modernising Primary Care 
            in NHS Scotland to Improve Health</strong>-That the Parliament applauds 
            the vital contribution to healthcare and health improvement made by 
            primary care teams across Scotland and supports further investment 
            and reform to improve access and redesign services round the needs 
            of patients. </p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3022.2</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Modernising Primary Care in 
            NHS Scotland to Improve Health</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3022) 
            in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end "including greater 
            devolution of power and resources to Local Health Care Co-operatives 
            to support and empower primary care teams.&quot; </p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3022.3</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Modernising Primary Care in NHS 
            Scotland to Improve Health</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3022) 
            in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;applauds&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;notes that in order to improve primary care 
            Local Health Care Co-operatives should be free to purchase care from 
            the most appropriate provider, be it public, private or voluntary, 
            and the incentives gained by the purchasing of such services should 
            be used to underpin patient choice; further urges the Scottish Executive 
            to continue to use private providers where they can supplement the 
            capacity of the NHS and provide value for money, and asks the Scottish 
            Executive to make available to patients information on alternative 
            providers and on waiting lists and times to allow patients to exercise 
            real choice.&quot; </p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-3022.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Modernising Primary Care in 
            NHS Scotland to Improve Health</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3022) 
            in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end &quot;, however, believes 
            that the use of the private health care sector by the NHS in Scotland 
            is divisive and counterproductive and should not be part of the Executive's 
            strategy.&quot; </p>
