          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2082</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade Football Match</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the football match between Whitehill Welfare and Kelso United in the East of Scotland League Premier Division at Ferguson Park, Rosewell, Midlothian on 27 November 2004 at 2.00 pm will be played to support Fairtrade footballs; notes that Fairtrade ensures that handmade footballs are made in humane working conditions and that workers are ensured a fair price for their work; believes that Fairtrade has a significant role to play in improving the lives of workers in the global south and supports the use of Fairtrade footballs throughout Scottish football, and congratulates Whitehill Welfare on being the first club in Scotland to use Fairtrade footballs.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2081</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Gritting on Stirling&rsquo;s Roads</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s decision not to allow the additional capital funding for safety-related school transport projects announced by the Minister for Transport on 4 November 2004 to be used on precautionary winter gritting of school bus routes; believes that the lack of any precautionary gritting on school bus routes is an issue of concern for several communities in the Stirling area, not least because of incidents that occurred last winter at Fintry and the Carron Valley where school transport was disrupted by treacherous road conditions; acknowledges that 300 people in Fintry alone signed a petition on this very issue earlier this year; believes that gritting school bus routes is about providing pupils with safer routes to school, and calls on the Executive to allow local authorities the flexibility to determine how best to spend additional roads funding to reflect local circumstances, such as severe road conditions.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2080#</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Closure of Craigneuk Development and Support Unit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep regret that the Craigneuk Development and Support Unit has been forced to announce its closure and the forced redundancy of its staff with effect from Christmas Eve, as a direct result of the actions taken by North Lanarkshire Council to withdraw funding from this organisation and the services it provides; notes that the withdrawal of the unit&rsquo;s counselling and support services will have a detrimental effect on the levels of poverty and deprivation in the communities which it serves, and believes that the way in which the council has treated this excellent organisation should be the subject of a detailed examination by Audit Scotland and the auditors of the European Commission and that appropriate steps should be taken to stop local authorities creating third party agencies which deliberately undermine and subvert the work of existing providers who are doing an excellent job, as was the case with the Craigneuk Development and Support Unit.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2079</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Feu Duty Compensation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees with the abolition of the feudal system; considers that in 2004 no one should be paying feu duty to a &quot;feudal superior&quot;; invites the Church of Scotland to reconsider its reported charging of feudal tenants when the feudal system is abolished on 28 November 2004, which would affect a disproportionate amount of elderly people, and considers that, if the Church of Scotland is not persuaded to do this, due to the considerable drop in income levels it claims this will bring, the Parliament should investigate ways of recompensing either the Church of Scotland or the householder to save them from being charged sums of between approximately &pound;400 and &pound;800 by their &quot;feudal superiors&quot;.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2078#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Arbuthnott Formula</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses grave concern that the Arbuthnott formula for health funding is exacerbating already difficult circumstances in NHS Grampian; notes that NHS Grampian&rsquo;s staff continue to deliver 10% of Scotland&rsquo;s health activity on 9% of the NHS budget; further notes the board&rsquo;s projected deficit in excess of &pound;13 million for the current financial year; condemns the consequential freezing of infection control nurse posts as a cost-saving measure, and believes that the Scottish Executive should urgently review the formula so that it reflects actual need rather than relying on secondary factors in the formula which skew the funding.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2077</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Carers&rsquo; Rights Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament praises the valuable and vital role played by the 666,000 carers in Scotland; notes that the fourth annual Carers&rsquo; Rights Day is being held on 3 December 2004 and that Carers Scotland will be visiting the Parliament on 2 December; recognises that millions of pounds worth of carers&rsquo; benefits go unclaimed each year, and considers that the Scottish Executive should step up its activities to encourage better take-up of the allowances rightly due to carers in Scotland.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2076#</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes:</strong> <strong>Network Rail GSM-R Masts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the erection by Network Rail of 29 metre-high Global System for Mobile Telecommunications (GSM-R) masts throughout Scotland, beginning with a pilot programme of 84 masts in the Strathclyde area; acknowledges that, despite giving assurances that communities would be fully informed in advance of any work, Network Rail has erected several masts with little or no prior direct notification to elected representatives or local residents; asks Network Rail to give an absolute assurance that masts erected using permitted development rights will not be used at any point for commercial purposes, and acknowledges that, whilst rail safety must always be paramount, the Scottish Executive should examine Network Rail&rsquo;s permitted development rights in relation to GSM-R masts and, in particular, the role that both Network Rail and local authorities should play in consulting local residents.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Robert Brown, Jackie Baillie</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2075</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Oakbank Awarded Scottish School of Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Oakbank School in Aberdeen which is today celebrating being named Scottish School of the Year by the Scottish Qualifications Authority; sends its best wishes to all those staff and pupils whose efforts have resulted in this award, and recognises their dedication and commitment to helping young people, who are facing significant challenges, translate negative educational experiences into positive ones.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2074</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/500) be approved.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Rhona Brankin</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2073#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Tackling the Impact of Misuse of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in the light of the major influence which misuse of alcohol has on many issues of great concern to it, such as violence in the home and in the streets, knife crime, sectarian and racial violence and abuse, misbehaviour at and around football matches, hate crimes and ill-health, believes that the Scottish Executive, while working on bringing forward a comprehensive Licensing Bill, should actively pursue bringing together the various proof-of-age card schemes into an effective voluntary national scheme and should encourage the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to enforce more vigorously existing legislation on adults not buying alcohol for under-age people and on the offence of serving alcohol to someone who is already drunk.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2072#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Lifting the Over Thirty Months Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) was introduced around eight years ago to protect the public against the potential risk that humans consuming beef which is over 30 months might contract CJD via BSE-infected beef; acknowledges that the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which was set up in order to provide an independent source of scientific advice on food safety, recommended in July 2003 that the scheme be scrapped and the ban lifted and replaced by a two-stage process, involving testing of animals for BSE, advice which was reaffirmed in July 2004; expresses concern that the FSA&rsquo;s advice has not been acted upon by the UK Government and devolved ministers; understands that the cost of the OTMS exceeds &pound;400 million a year, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should lift the ban as soon as practically possible in order that public money can be used directly for the health service or other priorities, and not be wasted on a scheme which is, according to the official food safety watchdog, no longer justified.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2071</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Burns Monument Kilmarnock</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance and value of life over property and sends its best wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the two Strathclyde firefighters who sustained serious injuries in their efforts to control the fire on Friday morning at the Burns Monument, Kilmarnock and to their families; calls on all politicians to support East Ayrshire Council in its efforts to recover the site so that its significance as an historical landmark in Kilmarnock, which is dear to the people of Kilmarnock and Loudoun and those across the world with a connection to Kilmarnock and Burns, can be retained.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Bill Butler, Elaine Smith, Sarah Boyack, Marilyn Livingstone, Cathy Peattie, Paul Martin, Donald Gorrie, Helen Eadie, Scott Barrie, Mr Frank McAveety, Mr Jamie Stone, Janis Hughes, Bristow Muldoon, Michael McMahon, Christine May, Pauline McNeill<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>S2M-2070#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Rascarrel Bay Hutters</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the position within Scots law of hutters in places such as Rascarrel Bay in Galloway, where their legal position as regards tenure allows landowners to impose very large rent increases; notes that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s position of encouraging local discussions does not work in practice in situations where one party is not willing to enter into negotiations, and considers that the Executive should re-examine its position with a view to implementing a suitable level of protection in law for hutters in Scotland.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2069</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Broadcasting in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the reported proposals of Ofcom to halve the amount of regional programming on ITV in favour of a greater emphasis on London-based programming and calls for the Scottish Parliament to be given responsibility for broadcasting in Scotland.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2068</strong> <strong>George Lyon:</strong> <strong>Over 30 Months Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to follow the advice of the Food Standards Agency and bring to an end, with the full endorsement of the chief medical officers, the Over Thirty Months Scheme on a UK-wide basis which will lead to rapid progress on quality Scottish beef once again being available to consumers across Europe.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Jeremy Purvis, John Farquhar Munro, Iain Smith, Mr Keith Raffan</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2067</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Timetabling of Sewel Motions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament urges the Parliamentary Bureau to ensure that as much parliamentary and committee time is allocated to considering each Sewel motion as would have been allocated to the issue if it was being considered as normal Scottish Parliament legislation.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Elaine Smith, Tommy Sheridan, Carolyn Leckie, Mike Pringle, John Swinburne<strong>*</strong></p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Jim Mather<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>S2M-2066</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Regeneration Projects</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that wholesale housing stock transfer was rejected by 91% of Aberdeen City Council tenants and calls on the Scottish Executive to write off Aberdeen&rsquo;s council housing debt to allow the city council to invest in regeneration projects in the city&rsquo;s areas of social exclusion.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Michael Matheson, Mr Bruce McFee<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Alex Neil<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong></p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Mike Pringle, Elaine Smith, Mike Watson, Jackie Baillie, Richard Baker, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Campbell Martin, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Mrs Mary Mulligan, Michael McMahon, Mr Alasdair Morrison, Mr Kenneth Macintosh, Robin Harper, Murray Tosh, Bill Butler, Margaret Smith, Brian Adam, Eleanor Scott, Helen Eadie, Mr Frank McAveety, Sarah Boyack, Dr Elaine Murray, Des McNulty, Christine May, Bristow Muldoon, Colin Fox, Scott Barrie, Michael Matheson, Mr Brian Monteith, Dr Jean Turner, Maureen Macmillan, John Scott, Alex Neil, Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong></p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Patrick Harvie, Eleanor Scott, Mrs Margaret Ewing, John Swinburne, Mike Pringle, Tommy Sheridan, Shiona Baird, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Alex Neil</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2064.2</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Doctors&rsquo; Responsibility to the Public Sector</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2064) in the name of Dr Jean Turner, leave out from &quot;NHS Scotland&quot; to end and insert &quot;the vast majority of general practitioners and GPs&rsquo; practices, as well as dentists and dentists&rsquo; practices, work as private contractors to the NHS and believes that, if immediate steps were taken to address this by making all doctors and dentists salaried employees of the NHS, many would go fully private and accordingly waiting lists and waiting times would then lengthen even more than they have under the current Scottish Executive.&quot;</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2063</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Decisions Must be Made in Scotland&rsquo;s Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the continual use of Sewel motions which curtails parliamentary scrutiny on issues of great importance to the people of Scotland; recognises that the Scottish Parliament is the right forum for discussion and scrutiny for all matters devolved to it; notes that Lord Sewel, who proposed this mechanism, admitted that this convention was set up to deal solely with &quot;minor, non-controversial&quot; issues yet, since 1999, there have been 51 Sewel motions involving such serious issues as asylum law, higher education and the law reform bill, and looks forward to Sewel motions no longer being used as a method of avoiding parliamentary scrutiny and to a full debate and vote on issues mentioned in the recent Queen&rsquo;s Speech that have particular relevance to Scotland.</p>
