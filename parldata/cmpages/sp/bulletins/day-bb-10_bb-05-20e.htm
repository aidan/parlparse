<p align="center"><strong>Section E &ndash; Written questions lodged on 19 May 2010</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information to the Parliament.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>S3W-33743 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of claims by chief constables reported in <em>The Herald</em> on 18 May 2010 that they were urged by senior civil servants not to reduce police numbers until autumn 2010, when a decrease could be blamed on UK Government spending cuts, and what action it plans to take.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33744 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it (a) was aware of senior civil servants advising or (b) instructed senior civil servants to advise chief constables not to reduce police numbers until autumn 2010, when a decrease could be blamed on UK Government spending cuts, and what action it plans to take.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33745 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of statements by chief constables reported in <em>The Herald</em> on 18 May 2010 that senior civil servants from the Directorate General for Justice and Communities are &quot;driving their own agenda by ignoring looming budget deficits&quot; and encouraging chief constables to delay reducing police numbers until autumn 2010 so that a decrease could be blamed on UK Government spending cuts.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33746 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is committed to maintaining funding for 1,000 extra police officers for the duration of the current parliamentary session.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33747 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of claims by chief constables reported in <em>The Herald</em> on 18 May 2010 that senior civil servants intimated that, if the chief constables allowed police numbers to fall, the final tranche of a &pound;40 million Scottish Government funding package would be withheld.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33748 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it (a) was aware of senior civil servants advising or (b) instructed senior civil servants to advise chief constables that, if forces allowed police numbers to fall, the final tranche of a &pound;40 million Scottish Government funding package would be withheld.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33749 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the comments by the chief constable of Grampian Police reported in <em>The Herald</em> on 18 May 2010 that he and other chief constables are increasingly concerned by civil servants driving their own agenda and that &quot;The civil servants are now more and more running policing. Five or six years ago, they used to be hard taskmasters but they would still respect and listen to chief constables but now they have grasped the policing agenda as their cause celebre.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33750 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the comments of the chief constable of Grampian Police reported in <em>The Herald</em> on 18 May 2010 that chief constables have been forced into an impossible situation with regard to maintaining police numbers, given that police officers cannot be laid off under law, meaning that civilian cutbacks are the only option available to forces.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33751 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many police forces it expects to experience budget deficits before the end of the current parliamentary session, broken down by (a) police force and (b) estimated scale of the deficit.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33752 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the latest estimate is of how many civilian job losses police forces will make by the end of the current parliamentary session, broken down by police force.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33753 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the comment by the chief constable of Grampian Police reported in <em>The Herald</em> on 18 May 2010 that &quot;We have a positive relationship with the Justice Secretary but we come out of a meeting with him and then the civil servants give us a completely contrary message&quot; and what action it plans to take.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33754 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that the civil servants in the Directorate General for Justice and Communities are aligned to the policy direction of the Cabinet Secretary for Justice.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33755 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has instructed chief constables to start cutting back the number of (a) police officers and (b) civilian staff and, if so, when and by how many.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33756 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what role civil servants play in the tripartite arrangement between ministers, chief constables and local police boards.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33757 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that civil servants play an appropriate role in the tripartite arrangement between ministers, chief constables and local police boards.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33758 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the comments by the chief constable of Grampian Police reported in <em>The Herald</em> on 18 May 2010 that &quot;It is meant to be a tripartite arrangement between ministers, chief constables and local police boards. For civil servants to be taking over is extremely concerning.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33759 Richard Baker:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the 1,000 extra police officers put in place will still be in place on 4 May 2011.</p>
<p><strong>S3W-33760 Ian McKee:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the implications of a rise in VAT from 17.5% to 20% would be for NHS boards in Scotland.</p>
