<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Government Debate: Violence against Women</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7641 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that &quot;09:00&quot; be substituted for &quot;09:15&quot; in Rule 2.2.3 for the purpose of allowing the meeting of the Parliament on Thursday 23 December 2010 to begin at 9.00 am.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7640 Bill Butler: The 40th Anniversary of the Ibrox Stadium Disaster</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament remembers the 66 football supporters who died in the Ibrox Stadium disaster on 2 January 1971; conveys its sincere condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives on that day; notes that a memorial service will be held to mark the 40th anniversary at the stadium on 3 January 2011 and that the former Rangers and Celtic captains, John Greig and Billy McNeill, will lead out the teams before the traditional New Year&rsquo;s Old Firm game as a mark of respect, and looks forward to both clubs and their supporters putting sporting rivalries to one side and coming together to remember those who died that day.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7639 Alasdair Allan: BBC Alba on Freeview</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the BBC Trust has, on 21 December 2010, given approval for the Gaelic language digital television channel, BBC Alba, to be shown in Scotland on Freeview following its review of the service; recognises that this comes following what it considers to have been a sustained and strong campaign from within and outwith the Gaelic community, which saw over 5,000 responses to the BBC Trust&rsquo;s public consultation on this issue; is encouraged to note for the future of the channel that four out of every five viewers are non-Gaelic speakers, and believes that BBC Alba is bringing Gaelic to Scotland as a whole and is helping to provide a major boost to the Scottish broadcasting industry and is acting as a real confidence boost to the Gaelic language at a critical point in its history.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7638 Pauline McNeill: BBC Alba</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the BBC Trust that BBC Alba will be made available on Freeview in Scotland; congratulates BBC Alba on being found to be performing well and achieving its aims, and believes that this will further promote Gaelic language and culture.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7637 Ian McKee: Dario Franchitti</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Tony McCoy on winning the BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2010 award but regrets that the Bathgate-born motor racing champion, Dario Franchitti, was not nominated by any of the 30 newspapers, with the exception of <em>The Herald</em>, for this year&rsquo;s Sports Personality of the Year; notes that Franchitti is the first ever British driver to win his second Indianapolis 500 race and considers that he clawed back a 60-plus-point deficit to secure his third IndyCar championship in the United States of America in 2010, and encourages the press and the BBC to give more consideration and coverage to Scotland&rsquo;s world-class sportsmen and women.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Gil Paterson<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7637.1 Mary Mulligan: Dario Franchitti</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7637) in the name of Ian McKee, insert at end &quot;; reminds MSPs that motion S3M-7145, <em>Parliament Congratulates Bathgate&rsquo;s IndyCar Champ, </em>was lodged on 5 October 2010 and was current until 21 December 2010, and considers that a larger number of members&rsquo; signatures to this motion would have given more consideration and coverage to Scotland&rsquo;s world-class sportsmen and women&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7636 Ian McKee: Presidential Elections in Belarus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the outcome of the recent presidential election in Belarus and the manner in which it was conducted; notes reports that over 10,000 demonstrators took to the streets in Minsk and that several hundred were detained for protesting against Alexander Lukashenko&rsquo;s re-election; further notes that the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe called the election &quot;flawed&quot; as it &quot;fell short of democratic standards&quot; while the United States of America described the result as &quot;illegitimate&quot; and condemned the reported crackdown on protestors; expresses further concern that at least seven of nine presidential candidates were among those arrested, some of whom were reported to have been beaten and injured; considers that the political situation in Belarus has not improved in recent years and that Belarus remains an authoritarian state with no respect for human rights, and strongly encourages the European Union to urgently review its foreign policy on Belarus, to reconsider imposing stronger sanctions on the country and to re-establish its travel ban on all top Belarusian officials that was suspended in 2008 until Belarus can organise fair and democratic elections and respect the human rights of its people.</p>
<p>Supported by: Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell<strong>*</strong>, Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7635 Linda Fabiani: Western Sahara</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council concerning Western Sahara and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was ratified by Morocco on 3 May 1979; regrets that, after more than 30 years, the decolonisation process of Western Sahara remains unfinished; expresses its concern about the recent deaths and injuries of Sahrawi people during the Moroccan security forces&rsquo; attempt to dismantle the camp of Gdaim Izyk in El-Aai&uacute;n, which was set up in peaceful protest; notes that journalists, EU national and regional parliamentarians and Members of the European Parliament were prevented from entering El-Aai&uacute;n and the Gdaim Izyk camp; fully supports the efforts of the UN Secretary General to find a political solution that will allow the self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara, and calls on the Moroccan Government to abide by the treaties and agreements to which it is party.</p>
