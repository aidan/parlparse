            <strong>Pauline McNeill: Funding of Glasgow's Museums and Galleries</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is disappointed that Glasgow's museums and galleries 
            were left out of the new funding for the arts announced on 2 November 
            2000; considers that the omission of support for Glasgow in arts funding 
            disregards Glasgow museums' &quot;special circumstances&quot; as outlined 
            in the Scottish Executive's National Cultural Strategy; believes that 
            Glasgow City Council's cultural, social inclusion and educational 
            strategy is second to none in Scotland; notes that the city's museums 
            are the most visited in the UK outside London and that Glasgow holds 
            the greatest civic collection in Europe, all of this being funded 
            by the council tax payers of Glasgow, and calls for the inequity in 
            funding of museums in Scotland to be redressed and the east-west divide 
            in arts funding to be ended.</font></p>

            aware of the importance of Royal Ordnance, Bishopton to the economy 
            of Renfrewshire and of the strategic defence role it performs and 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to do what it can to persuade BAe 
            Systems to reconsider its decision to close the plant on the basis 
            of both economic and strategic considerations.</font></p>

            further notes Her Majesty's Government's commitment to reduce greenhouse 
            gases in order to respond to global warming, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to consult urgently on measures to deal with the consequences 
            of climate change, to strengthen flood defences, to address the question 
            of planning developments in flood plains and to minimise environmental

            Library of Alexandria and, noting the rich history of Scotland's own 
            literature, asks that an appropriate collection of works is gifted

            parliamentarians which met in Rome on 4 November 2000 on the urgent

            the disadvantages of globalisation, and to promote human dignity and 
            freedom; acknowledges the significant progress made by Her Majesty's 
            Government towards these objectives, and welcomes the decision of
