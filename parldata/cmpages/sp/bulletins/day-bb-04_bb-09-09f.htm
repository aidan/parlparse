          <P><strong>*S2M-1666</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Franz Ferdinand Winning the Mercury Music Prize</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Franz Ferdinand on winning the Mercury Music Prize on 7 September 2004 and notes that a Glasgow-based band winning this prestigious pop music award draws attention to the vibrancy and fresh talent on the Scottish popular music scene.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1665#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>HMI Report on Stirling&rsquo;s Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Stirling Council Children&rsquo;s Services for the outstanding report published by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education in August, providing strong evidence that inclusive schools are high-achieving schools and of the benefits of an integrated children&rsquo;s service.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1664#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Beslan Tragedy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its deepest sympathy to the people of Beslan following the terrorist outrage which ended in the death of over three hundred people, many of whom were children; notes that, with experience of the Dunblane Primary School tragedy, the people of Scotland will be sharing the anguish felt across the world at this terrible act of terrorism against young children, carers and teaching staff in what was considered to be a safe and secure learning environment, and supports the thousands of Russian people in their grief who have taken to the streets to look for answers to this tragedy.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1663#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Second Forth Road Bridge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the relaunch of the campaign against a second Forth Road Bridge, under the title ForthRightAlliance, including Friends of the Earth Scotland, the Cockburn Association, TRANSform Scotland and others; further notes that 70% of cars crossing the bridge at peak times do so with a single occupant, and believes that the investment proposed for a new bridge would be better spent on providing public transport alternatives to allow drivers an alternative to using their cars.</P>

          <P><strong>*S2M-1661</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Mercury Music Prize</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the band Franz Ferdinand on winning the Mercury Music Prize; believes that this is another indicator of the international success of the music industry in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work closely with the industry and artists and performers to ensure the continued success of this important cultural enterprise for the country.</P>
