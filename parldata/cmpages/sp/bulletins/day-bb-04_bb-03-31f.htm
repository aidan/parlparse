          <p><strong>*S2M-1128</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>National 
            Depression Week, 19 to 25 April 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises that one in five people will suffer from depression at 
            some point in their lives and considers that National Depression Week 
            will highlight the problem; notes the sharp increase in prescription 
            of medication for depression with little or no psychological support 
            and the continued use of the anti-depressant Prozac for those under 
            18; considers this to be an intolerable situation, and calls for the 
            support and resources required to enable a holistic approach to treating 
            depression to be put in place as a matter of urgency.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1127</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>GATS 
            and Water</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes Her Majesty's Government's 
            commitment to the UN's pledge to halve the proportion of people without 
            access to safe drinking water by 2015; notes that access to water 
            is the most basic of human rights; notes concern that &quot;water 
            for human use&quot; is included as a proposal under current negotiations 
            of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) at the World 
            Trade Organisation and that once a country commits its water sector 
            to GATS, this commitment is effectively irreversible, irrespective 
            of the consequences; further notes that current GATS negotiations 
            could threaten the extension of clean water supply to the poorest 
            communities by undermining pro-poor policies such as the preference 
            for public or not-for-profit providers, and calls on Her Majesty's 
            Government to persuade our EU counterparts to withdraw the proposal 
            to bring &quot;water for human use&quot; into the GATS negotiations.</P>

            mass slaughter of deer at Glenfeshie, instigated by the Deer Commission 
            for Scotland; believes that, whilst culling deer is necessary to control 
            numbers, deer fencing is necessary in order to protect forestry and 
            the removal, or non-provision of, deer fencing has contributed substantially 
            to the present situation; further believes that the Deer Commission 
            may intend to carry out further mass slaughter of deer out of season 
            and at various locations in Scotland; considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should meet representatives of the Scottish Gamekeepers 
            Association to hear its concerns regarding the massacre of Glenfeshie 
            and regarding the measures that should be taken in order to secure 
            proper management of both deer and forestry, and, in the meantime, 
            considers that there should be a moratorium on any further mass slaughter 
            of deer in Scotland.</P>

            are in the custody or under the control of the British Broadcasting 
            Corporation having its principal place of business in Scotland at 
            Broadcasting House, Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow G12 8DG, and accordingly 
            requires the British Broadcasting Corporation in terms of section 
            23 of the Scotland Act 1998 to deliver such documents to the Clerk 
            of the Parliament in accordance with instructions to be given by him 
            in terms of section 24 of said Act and in order to offer no impediment

            Failure of the BBC to Hand Over Tapes to the Fraser Inquiry</strong>-As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-1117) in the name of David McLetchie, 
            leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes 
            that, whilst it is wholly inappropriate for any parliament to issue 
            orders to the press and media requiring them to hand over material, 
            the BBC should cooperate with the Holyrood Inquiry by providing to 
            it the tape recordings of the interviews with the late Donald Dewar 
            and Enric Miralles, which have been filmed for the proposed programme, 
            &quot;The Gathering Place&quot;, because they may include material 
            of relevance to the remit of the Holyrood Inquiry; further believes 
            that the Holyrood Inquiry should have had conferred upon it at the 
            outset the powers to compel the appearance of witnesses and production 
            of documents set out in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921; 
            considers that the First Minister and the Presiding Officer should 
            now explore whether such powers can yet be conferred upon the Holyrood 
            Inquiry; believes that the leaders of all political parties in Scotland 
            should immediately agree to write jointly to the BBC calling upon 
            it to cooperate with the Inquiry, and considers that the First Minister 
            should seek to appear before the Inquiry as a witness in order to 
            answer questions about his role as Minister for Finance.&quot;</P>

            an overspend of £1.3 billion on the Astute Class Submarine, and further 
            defends the rights of the BBC and journalists to protect their sources.&quot;</P>

            of Carmyllie QC as instigated by the First Minister and the Presiding 
            Officer; encourages all those with an interest in the Inquiry to provide 
            Lord Fraser with all required documentation and material and strongly 
            encourages both the Inquiry and the BBC to arrive at a mutually acceptable 
            resolution to the ongoing issue surrounding the availability of information 
            from tapes of the Wark Clements Productions' programme entitled &quot;The 
            Gathering Place&quot;; supports the independence of the BBC against 
            political interference as a fundamental bulwark of our civil liberties, 
            and believes that the Parliament would undermine the independence 
            of the BBC by seeking to compel it to take any particular course of 
            action but would nevertheless welcome a decision by the BBC to allow 
            Lord Fraser appropriate access to the tapes.&quot;</P>

            have done to this vital Scottish industry, and therefore agrees that, 
            to reverse the tax stamp decision and ensure that the competitive 
            position of Scotch whisky is not further eroded, the Scottish Parliament

            on HM Treasury to engage in further discussion with the industry on 
            the impact of these measures with a view to reaching a satisfactory 
            outcome which deals with tax fraud and would lead to the decision

            of compensation measures is put in place to minimise the impact on 
            the industry.</P>
