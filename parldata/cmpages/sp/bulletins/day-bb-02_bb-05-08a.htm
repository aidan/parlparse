              <em>Meeting the Needs. Priorities, Actions and Targets for sustainable 
              development in Scotland</em>, and the vision that it sets out for 
              a sustainable Scotland in which the Executive conserves, protects 
              and harnesses Scotland's natural resources and the talents of the 
              people; believes that the statement marks an important step forward 
              for sustainable development in Scotland; agrees that the indicator 
              list provides a good basis on which to begin to measure progress,

                that, while the statement marks an important step forward for 
                sustainable development in Scotland, further work is required 
                to produce a list of indicators that is more comprehensive and 
                meaningful for the purpose of measuring progress and that the 
                targets' lack of ambition does not recognise Scotland's full potential 
                and therefore will not contribute significantly to ensuring a 
                sustainable future for Scotland.&quot; </p>

                leave out from first &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses 
                its concern that the statement has not gone far enough, particularly 
                in its indicator list given that, 27 months after first promised, 
                24 indicators have been selected but less than 50% have set targets; 
                questions whether the indicator list therefore provides an adequate 
                basis to measure progress; further believes that the inclusion 
                of no less than 15 other consultations, strategies, forums and 
                plans may hinder the long-term delivery of the new vision, and 
                supports the development of a more focused action plan for the 
                continuation of sustainable development in Scotland. </p>

            <p><strong>S1M-2966</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>World 
              Asthma Day, 7 May 2002</strong>-That the Parliament notes that World 
              Asthma Day is on Tuesday 7 May 2002 when, in the United Kingdom, 
              the National Asthma Campaign will highlight childhood asthma; is 
              aware that over 113,000 (around 1 in 6) children in Scotland have 
              been diagnosed with asthma and that the incidence is highest amongst 
              children; commends the National Asthma Campaign Scotland for its 
              work on childhood asthma, including its publication of the first 
              childhood asthma audit and its programme of asthma information sessions 
              for adults working in the early years sector; further notes the 
              soon to be published Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network/British 
              Thoracic Society guidelines for asthma and invites the Scottish 
              Executive to devise a national asthma strategy to ensure that these 
              guidelines are implemented across the country and matched by any 
              necessary resources. </p>
