Stone:</STRONG> <STRONG>Wick Ambulance Service</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
<A NAME="MotionText">recognises the vital work of the Wick ambulance service; 
is concerned at the lack of additional funding that was made available to the 
Highlands from the £22 million the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) received for 
modernisation; notes the long on-call working regime that means ambulance crews 
are often on duty for as much as 20 hours at a time and are routinely required 
to make long journeys of over 200 miles; is further concerned that crews suffer 
from sleep deprivation, possibly endangering themselves, their passengers and 
other road users, and asks the Scottish Executive and the SAS to urgently review 
the on-call working arrangements at Wick Ambulance Station, where staff are paid 
less than 90p per hour for being on-call, with a view to upgrading it from part-time 
on-call to full-time. </A> </P><P>&nbsp;</P></DIR><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
