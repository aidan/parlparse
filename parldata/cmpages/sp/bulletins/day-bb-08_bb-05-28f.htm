<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2002</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Common Agricultural Policy Health Check</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, noting the European Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposals for the health check of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to consult on these proposals, and on the longer-term implementation of CAP in Scotland, in order that agriculture remains a dynamic and competitive industry with farmers playing their full part in achieving the Scottish Government&rsquo;s purpose of sustainable economic growth through food production and environmental management of our agricultural land.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2001</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Moving Scotland Forward</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the many decisions taken over the last 12 months to make Scotland a wealthier, greener, healthier, safer and smarter nation, including the reduction in business rates for 150,000 small business properties, the funding to put more police on Scotland&rsquo;s streets, the new partnership with local government and the cross-party initiatives to tackle problems related to drugs, alcohol and tobacco; further welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to more open government and its proposals on proactive publication of material across government and, in particular, the pilot project within the environment portfolio; looks forward to a range of proposals from the Scottish Government with regard to climate change, patients&rsquo; rights, criminal justice, marine policy, safeguarding rural schools and driving forward the Curriculum for Excellence, and believes that many of the measures already agreed by the Parliament to improve the lives of people living in Scotland will be undermined unless the UK Government takes action to tackle rising costs of fuel and food.</p>
<p>Supported by: Michael Russell<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-2000</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Inquiry into the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent announcement by the Scottish Government to restrict the scope of what can be discussed at the forthcoming public local inquiry into the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR), allowing only discussion on technical aspects of the road and disallowing any wider discussion on the AWPR project in principle or context; notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision to restrict the scope of the public local inquiry into the AWPR means that a large number of the more than 10,000 objectors to the project will be disallowed from giving evidence to the public local inquiry, as their objections and arguments now lie outwith its scope; is concerned that the public local inquiry into the AWPR will not, therefore, consider the project&rsquo;s spiralling and uncapped cost, its impact on local communities and the local environment, its context within wider transport policy, its impact on traffic levels and pollution, its proposed funding method through both and national and local government, and its relevance in the context of climate change and the spiralling cost of private motoring; considers the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision to restrict the scope of the public local inquiry into the AWPR to be a serious blow to public participation and local democracy, which undermines the aim of the Scottish Parliament to engage and involve the people of Scotland in planning and development issues, and calls on the Scottish Government to broaden the scope of the public local inquiry into the AWPR to include discussion and examination of all of the evidence available and relevant to it, including consideration of the principles underlying the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1999</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>The Charity Test (Specified Bodies) (Scotland) Order 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee recommends that the Charity Test (Specified Bodies) (Scotland) Order 2008 be approved.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1995</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> <strong>The Bah&aacute;&rsquo;i Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament shares the concern of the Scottish Bah&aacute;&rsquo;i community at the persecution of followers of the faith in Iran; notes that any formal Bah&aacute;&rsquo;i organisation is outlawed in Iran but that activities have been coordinated by seven prominent members known as the Friends; expresses alarm that six of these seven Friends have been arrested and held in Tehran&rsquo;s Evin prison; notes that an estimated 200 Bah&aacute;&rsquo;is have been executed in Iran since 1978, that hundreds have been imprisoned and tortured and thousands more deprived of jobs, pensions, businesses and educational opportunities, and calls on the Iranian authorities to show tolerance towards this non-violent faith community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1994</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Paralympic Pre-Games Training Camps</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Grangemouth Stadium and National Indoor Athletics Academy and Wishaw Sports Centre on their selection as pre-competition training centres for the Paralympic Games and their inclusion in the guide which will be presented to national paralympic committees (NPCs) in Beijing; recognises that the facilities were selected after a rigorous evaluation against selection criteria in close co-operation with sporting bodies including the British Paralympic Association, and encourages both Falkirk and North Lanarkshire councils to use their best efforts to promote the facilities to competing athletes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1993</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s First Tidal Device on National Grid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the creation and development of the OpenHydro tidal device situated in the waters off Eday, Orkney, which is the first such tidal device to produce energy for the National Grid in Scotland; recognises this achievement as a major milestone in the development of marine renewable energy in Scotland and considers it to be a triumph for Irish company OpenHydro and the European Marine Energy Centre; looks forward to an era of greater development of tidal devices which will make a huge contribution of clean, green energy to the nation, and further anticipates the economic spin-offs which will accrue to communities on both sides of the Pentland Firth as well as further afield.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1992</strong> <strong>John Lamont:</strong> <strong>Free Personal Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Scottish Government to provide an additional &pound;40 million to fund free personal care in Scotland; calls on all local authorities to heed the decision of the Parliament that they should cease to charge for assisting with food preparation forthwith and refund all persons wrongly charged for this service in the past, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that local authorities are provided with sufficient funding to fully comply with the resolution of the Parliament in this respect.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1991#</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Scanner Donation to NHS Lothian</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the Royal Bank of Scotland&rsquo;s donation of a scanner to NHS Lothian, while generous and of undoubted value to the bank&rsquo;s employees, the general public and medical researchers, nevertheless, if replicated by other companies or interests, represents possible external direction of NHS boards&rsquo; policies, priorities and resource management, and therefore calls for further debate on how donations are made to the NHS before precedents are established.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1990</strong> <strong>Nigel Don:</strong> <strong>Post Office Card Account and Further Post Office Closures</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that over 4 million people choose to use the Post Office card account across the United Kingdom, including many in Scotland, and that these transactions earn the Post Office &pound;200 million in income each year; notes that the UK Government will soon announce its decision on which company should operate the successor product to the Post Office card account from 2010; recognises that the Post Office is best placed to provide this service through its unrivalled geographical reach, its status as a trusted brand and its ability to offer customers a seamless transition; believes that the continuation of the Post Office card account as a Post Office product is essential to the future viability of the post office network following the Network Change Programme; understands that a further 350 post offices will be forced to close in an unplanned manner across Scotland if the UK Government does not award the successor product to the Post Office, and urges the UK Government to award the contract to the Post Office.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1989</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Export Credits Guarantee Department</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament disapproves of the behaviour of the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), the official export credit agency of the UK Government; considers that the primary purpose of this surreptitious department should be to honourably broaden the UK economy but recognises that it privately banks for the aerospace and oil industry, naively ignoring requirements to facilitate exports; is deeply concerned that the ECGD may be breaking international law, paying little or no regard to known environmental standards; believes that the work of the ECGD illustrates that the UK Government is only paying lip service to issues relating to climate change and environmental pollution as long as it continues to subsidise and endorse an organisation actively working against the government&rsquo;s own stated policies; sustains calls for transparent and open reporting, effective public participation and alignment with international treaties, all of which have generally been accepted worldwide; considers it to be totally unacceptable that a department such as the ECGD is able to operate almost autonomously from UK ministerial control and questions if this is deliberate; deplores the unsubstantiated rhetoric with which the ECGD cedes responsibility for lowering the cost of carbon emissions, and the inconsequential business principles, which time and again have delivered up the submissive ECGD to foreign political pressure; believes that the UK Government should suspend the ECGD until a full investigation into its working practices and controls has been completed, and welcomes the gradual phase-out of the ECGD&rsquo;s support for carbon intensive projects.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn<strong>*</strong>, Stuart McMillan<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1988</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Marie Curie Cancer Care Partnership with NHS Lanarkshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Marie Curie Cancer Care and NHS Lanarkshire have agreed to the largest ever nursing contract in the charity&rsquo;s history, a contract which almost doubles the number of patients being cared for at home compared to last year; endorses the strong partnership working that exists between Marie Curie Cancer Care and NHS Lanarkshire, and congratulates Marie Curie Cancer Care on the excellent care that it provides to people who are terminally ill and their families.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1987</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Recycling Provisions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent survey by Glasgow&rsquo;s <em>Evening Times</em> which showed great variation among local councils as to their recycling provision; notes that in Glasgow only 31% of households have a recycling bin of any colour while some neighbouring authorities have collection arrangements for cardboard, food waste and plastic as well as tins, glass and paper; welcomes the work done by the previous administration to dramatically increase recycling, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with local authorities to further improve and increase recycling services and to create a minimum national standard for service provision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1986</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Inverclyde Council Win at COSLA&rsquo;s &quot;Oscars&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Inverclyde Council on receiving bronze awards for three projects at the COSLA Excellence Awards 2008; notes that the winning projects were The Recruit, a personal development programme for senior school pupils based on The Apprentice, The Materials Recycling Facility which provides a local facility to sort material from recycling schemes<em>, </em>and Eat, Skip and Smile which promotes healthy eating awareness and cooking skills to pre-school children with the help of parents and students from St. Stephen&rsquo;s High School, and further notes that the awards recognise council-run projects that provide an outstanding service to the public.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd<strong>*</strong>, Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1985</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Foundation Year One Doctors</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the repeal of sections sections 10 to 13 of the Medical Act 1983 which removes the statutory requirement for foundation year one doctors to be contractually resident in hospital unless they live close by; recognises that, as a consequence, those newly qualified doctors can now be faced with substantial charges for accommodation that was previously free; further recognises the particular needs of doctors rotating through different hospitals and those whose shift and travel requirements may make travel at the end of a shift unsafe, and calls on the Scottish Government to enter into discussions with the British Medical Association in Scotland to resolve this issue.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1984</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Scottish Cup</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Queen of the South and Rangers football clubs for an exciting Scottish Cup Final on 24 May 2008 and congratulates Rangers on its victory and Queens on its spirited performance, especially in the second half.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1983</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Oil Wealth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the recent study, performed by Grant Thornton, validating the immense oil wealth potentially available to Scotland; notes conservative estimates giving an independent Scotland a &pound;4.4 billion annual surplus, even if Scotland had access to only 82.5% of North Sea oil revenue; is aware that, with oil prices now at $135 a barrel and heading towards $200, this is an huge underestimate of the wealth that could accrue to Scotland; acknowledges that Oil &amp; Gas UK has stated that reserves could last for at least 30 years, during which time a fund for future generations could be initiated and established; regrets that Scotland&rsquo;s unionist parties, in thrall to their bosses in London and with no faith in the Scottish people, still try to argue that Scotland is a parasitic burden on the United Kingdom, with Labour being particularly guilty, claiming in the spring of 2007 that an independent Scotland would be in deficit to the tune of &pound;12.9 billion a year; looks forward to a time when Scotland and its people will, through independence, be allowed to realise its full economic potential, and calls on the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer to transfer Scottish oil and gas wealth into the hands of the Scottish people.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1983.1</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Oil Wealth</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1983) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out from &quot;the recent study&quot; to end and insert &quot;the current high International price of oil at around $135 per barrel but also notes that in the last decade alone the price has fluctuated significantly from the current high to as low as as $9; believes that, notwithstanding the current high price of crude oil, basing an economy and the funding of public services on such an erratic commodity whose supply is determined principally by a Middle Eastern cartel would be economically illiterate; regrets the typically obtuse characterisation by Scottish nationalists of fellow Scots who do not favour splitting the United Kingdom into separate states but who rather believe the interests of Scottish people are best served by retaining their influence in one of the world&rsquo;s largest economies as &quot;in thrall to their bosses in London&quot;, and considers that the Barnett Formula guarantees Scotland a higher proportion of revenue per head of population than south of the border and that far from having &quot;no faith in the Scottish people&quot; the pro-Union parties have every confidence that they will make the correct decision with regards to Scotland&rsquo;s constitutional future in clear and stark contrast to the SNP.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-1893</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Scottish Agricultural Wages Board</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the efforts of Unite - the Union to retain the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board as a separate body and for its remit to be expanded to cover all workers in the agricultural sector, including those in private and ornamental gardens and all types of fish farming; believes that the board&rsquo;s future is at risk as a result of the First Minister&rsquo;s statement on more effective government; believes that the Orders set by the board covering 25,000 workers constitute a model of best practice in industrial relations, and supports the role performed by the board since 1949, in light of the unique nature of the work conducted by those in the agricultural sector, the notoriously high fatality and injury rates in agriculture and the prevalence of gangmasters in the sector, controlling thousands of migrant workers from the EU accession states who are at a greater degree of risk of exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1893.1</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Scottish Agricultural Wages Board</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1893) in the name of Elaine Murray, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the valuable work performed by the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board (SAWB) in protecting minimum pay and conditions arrangements for agricultural workers; welcomes the Government&rsquo;s review of the SAWB as an opportunity to give careful consideration to future arrangements for determining the pay and conditions of service of agricultural workers in Scotland; agrees that work is needed to review the functions and processes of the SAWB in the context of national minimum wage structures and other employment legislation; believes that protection for all agricultural workers&rsquo; pay and conditions must be maintained, and recognises the importance of consulting widely with stakeholders on achieving the most effective processes.&quot;</p>
