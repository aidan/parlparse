          <p><strong>*S3M-2666</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Maybole Bypass</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of improved transport links between South Ayrshire and the rest of Scotland to the economic recovery of the area; agrees that the upgrading of the A77 and the construction of the Maybole bypass will play a vital role in improving transport links to the ports of Stranraer and Cairnryan and in attracting future private investment, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that South Ayrshire connectivity is made a priority when the outcome of the strategic transport projects review is announced.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-2621</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Ending the Shame of Child Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with alarm statistics produced by the Campaign to End Child Poverty that show that Glasgow has the worst levels of child poverty in Scotland including large areas, such as Glasgow North East where 73% of children - 12,010 out of 16,435 - come from families that are either workless or in receipt of working tax credit, and smaller clusters, such as in north Barlanark and Easterhouse south where the proportion in workless families or in families on working tax credit is 98%; supports those involved in the United Kingdom&rsquo;s biggest ever event to end child poverty, at Trafalgar Square on Saturday 4 October 2008; further supports the call of the organisers of the march for the UK Government to spend just &pound;3 billion a year to reach its own target to halve child poverty by 2010 and stay on course to end child poverty altogether; believes that all governments and administrations in the UK should work positively together in order to address child poverty issues; acknowledges that this can mean different approaches and strategies within different areas of the UK, and further believes that an excellent example of this is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach, including moves to abolish prescription charges, extend entitlement to free school meals and school clothing grants, the freezing of the council tax and the introduction of direct payments to kinship carers of looked-after children.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-2621.1</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Ending the Shame of Child Poverty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2621) in the name of Bob Doris, leave out from &quot;the worst levels&quot; to end and insert &quot;some of the worst levels of child poverty in Scotland; therefore welcomes the findings of the most recent National Statistics publication of <em>Scottish Households Below Average Income</em>, which shows a marked decline between 1999 and 2007 in the number of Scottish households in both absolute and relative poverty, including a 28% decrease in relative child poverty and a 61% decrease in absolute child poverty, meaning that the previous administration&rsquo;s target to halve absolute child poverty by 2010 was being met significantly ahead of schedule; believes that this progress would not have been possible without many of the initiatives by the previous administration and the UK Government, including the Sure Start programme, record increases in child benefit, the working families tax credit, child tax credit and the national minimum wage, the latter of which was finally passed in the House of Commons without the support of a single SNP MP; also believes that, despite SNP MSPs&rsquo; rhetoric, freezing council tax and abolishing prescription charges by 2011 does absolutely nothing to assist those on the lowest incomes given that they are already exempt; considers that after nearly 18 months in government, the SNP is yet to fulfil its pledge to introduce direct payments to kinship carers of looked-after children and that its budget, passed with the support of the Conservatives, is in fact precipitating cuts to a range of local services including school meals provision and to a host of voluntary organisations providing services affecting some of Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable children, and further believes that this threatens much of the progress made during the past decade in tackling child poverty as well as seriously undermining the SNP&rsquo;s credibility on these matters.&quot;</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-2620</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Aleke Banda</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of Aleke Banda to retire from frontline politics in Malawi at the next election; recognises the role that he played in the campaign for independence for Malawi, helping to build a new country, and his 55 years in active politics; congratulates him on his achievements during his career, and wishes him well in his retirement, hoping that he will, in his own words, &quot;find the time to read some bedtime stories, to learn to kick a football or fly a kite&quot;.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-2609#</strong> <strong>Christopher Harvie:</strong> <strong>The Kingdom of Fife and Fife in the World - A Platform of Partnership</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament greets the Year of Homecoming and envisages the pioneering of a &quot;platform of partnership&quot; using the Kingdom of Fife as a trial project involving the creation of worldwide internet links between places with Fife names, affected by Fifers or twinned with Fife communities and involving schools, churches, community groups and associations, and hopes that the resumption of the Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry can make this virtual bond a real one.</p>

          <p><strong>S3M-2581</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Post Office Closure Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision by Post Office Ltd to close all but one of the branches identified for closure in its Ayrshire, Inverclyde, Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire area plan, including those branches in Kildrum, Queenzieburn, Banton and Plains; further notes that these closures come in the face of massive public opposition and criticism of Post Office Ltd&rsquo;s case for the closure of these outlets; believes that post office branches are community assets that provide more than simple commercial operations, and encourages all interested parties to work together to explore what options may exist to ensure affected communities can still access the vital services provided by their local post office.</p>

          <p> <strong>S3M-2137#</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Living and Dying with Advanced Heart Failure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Living and dying with advanced heart failure: a palliative care approach</em>, by the Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care with the support of British Heart Foundation Scotland and the Scottish Government; notes that people with heart failure have a worse prognosis and poorer quality of life than many cancer patients and that 50% of advanced heart failure patients die within a year of diagnosis, many of them suddenly and unexpectedly, particularly in the west of Scotland; believes that uncertainty around prognosis should not be a barrier to people with advanced heart failure, or those with any other condition, receiving appropriate palliative care; is concerned that, despite the recommendations of the CHD and Stroke Task Force in 2001 that provision needed to be made for palliative care for advanced heart failure, too many of these vulnerable patients are still not getting the care they need at the time that they need it most, and believes that account should be taken of the report&rsquo;s recommendations and that the needs of patients with conditions other than cancer, like advanced heart failure, should be explicitly addressed in the forthcoming palliative care strategy and the refreshed CHD and Stroke Strategy.</p>
