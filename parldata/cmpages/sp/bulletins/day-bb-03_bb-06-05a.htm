          <p>9:30 am&#9;Debate on Young People&#151;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-103</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Young 
            People</strong>&#151;That the Parliament celebrates the contribution 
            made to society by the young people of Scotland, both at home and 
            abroad; applauds their dynamism, intellect, enthusiasm, enterprise, 
            creativity and individuality; will work in partnership with young 
            people to help meet their aspirations; believes that the establishment 
            of the new Children&#146;s Commissioner, measures to reform education 
            by ensuring that the curriculum is built around the needs of the child 
            and that education takes place in the most modern facilities, extending 
            access to high quality sport and leisure facilities and support for 
            youth work and volunteering will help young people to reach their 
            full potential and participate in society; recognises that some young 
            people require additional support and measures to do so, and commits 
            itself whenever possible to making sure that appropriate support is 
            provided</p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-103.3</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Young People</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-103) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave 
            out from first &quot;will&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises, 
            however, that it is essential for Scotland that we have the powers 
            to ensure that young people do not have to leave Scotland in their 
            20s to find a future; further recognises that tackling the low birth 
            rate and developing an effective inward migration policy for Scotland 
            are vital elements towards ensuring that there are enough young Scots 
            to maintain our country&#146;s vitality, and, in the meantime, notes 
            that it is right for there to be a Children&#146;s Commissioner and 
            for the Scottish Executive to develop measures in the field of education 
            and youth work, and to provide additional support for learning, volunteering, 
            culture, sport and leisure facilities for young people in Scotland.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-103.1</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Young 
            People</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S2M-103) in the name 
            of Peter Peacock, insert at end &quot;whilst recognising the central 
            role played by parents and families in enabling young people to become 
            responsible adults and therefore fulfil their potential.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-103.4</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott: Young People</strong>&#151;As 
            an amendment to motion (S2M-103) in the name of Peter Peacock, insert 
            at end &quot;and calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that 
            educational programmes dealing with sustainable development and environmental 
            and social justice issues are included in the curriculum in order 
            to foster responsible attitudes, that opportunities for outdoor education 
            are emphasised, that particular attention is paid to those one in 
            seven young people who are reported to have &quot;disappeared&quot; 
            from the system and are not in a job, training, education or on the 
            unemployment register despite government measures such as the New 
            Deal, and that the minimum age for voting and standing in elections 
            is lowered to 16 years.&quot;</p>
