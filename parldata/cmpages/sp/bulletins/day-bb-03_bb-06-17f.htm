          <p><strong>*S2M-154</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Patient 
            Focus and Public Involvement in the NHS</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            welcomes the measures in <em>Partnership For Care: Scotland&#146;s 
            Health White Paper</em> and the Partnership Agreement to step up progress 
            to ensure that greater patient engagement and wider public involvement 
            are at the heart of a modernised NHS and supports the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
            commitment to placing the patient at the heart of the design of services, 
            implementing a patient information initiative, ensuring public involvement 
            in health service reorganisation plans by obliging NHS boards to consult 
            stakeholders more effectively and setting up a Scottish health council 
            as a national body with a local presence across Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-153</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Hamilton 
            School for the Deaf</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates 
            Hamilton School for the Deaf, its management, staff, pupils and parents 
            on the positive results it achieved from the recent inspection of 
            the school by Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Education; notes 
            that the school is an outstanding example of special educational provision, 
            and believes that high quality special educational schools such as 
            Hamilton School for the Deaf must remain a feature of Scotland&#146;s 
            education system whilst they continue to meet the appropriate educational 
            and social needs of individual pupils.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-152</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Ability 
            of Holyrood Progress Group</strong>&#151;That the Parliament has no 
            confidence in the ability of the Holyrood Progress Group to achieve 
            any of its aims, which are to deal competently with question and answer 
            sessions for MSPs, monitor and report on the progress of the Holyrood 
            project and control expenditure, and resolves to exert a greater measure 
            of client control over the project by appointing an experienced building 
            industry professional to represent the Parliament and the public interest 
            on the Holyrood Project Team in place of the current project director.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-151</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Selling 
            Alcohol to a Drunken Person</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses 
            concern that no prosecutions were brought in 2002-03 under section 
            76 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 for selling alcoholic liquor 
            to a drunken person and believes that it is essential that full use 
            is made of existing laws such as this in the campaign against violence, 
            disorder and alcohol abuse.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-150</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>European 
            Aid to Fishing Communities</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            that, at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 26 May 2003, the 
            European Commission issued a memorandum seeking the views of member 
            states on the proposal from the European Parliament that an additional 
            €150 million be allocated as aid to fishing communities and urges 
            the First Minister and the Minister for Environment and Rural Development 
            to make representations to the United Kingdom minister ultimately 
            responsible for making any funding bid and to contact the commission 
            directly in order to prepare the ground for that bid, given that the 
            commission has invited comments on this issue.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-149</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro:</strong> 
            <strong>Publication of Harry Potter Books in Scots Gaelic</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the apparent confusion of Bloomsbury Publishing 
            plc, the publisher of the Harry Potter books, between living and dead 
            languages; considers that, if the company conducted proper market 
            research, it would find a considerable number of native speakers of 
            Scots Gaelic and rather fewer native speakers of Latin and Ancient 
            Greek and that it should therefore reconsider its eccentric decision 
            to publish the Harry Potter books in Latin and Ancient Greek and not 
            in Scots Gaelic; notes, to the company&#146;s credit, that Harry Potter 
            books will be published in Irish Gaelic and Welsh, and calls on the 
            company to reconsider its decision not to publish the books in Scots 
            Gaelic.</p>

            plc, foillsichearan leabhraichean Harry Potter, mun eadar-dhealachadh
