          <p> <strong>*S2M-1527</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Public 
            Involvement in Planning</strong>-That the Parliament regrets Glasgow 
            City Council's decision to grant planning permission for 22 flats 
            and a restaurant to be built in an outstanding conservation area along 
            the River Kelvin in Glasgow's West End; notes that the development 
            will destroy the beauty of the locality and lead to the obliteration 
            of an important wildlife corridor; further notes that the development 
            will jeopardise the future of small, locally-owned, nearby businesses; 
            believes that the absence of a third party right of appeal in the 
            planning system allows developers to have a huge advantage over communities; 
            further believes that the appropriate response to private sector critics 
            of third party rights is to develop positive and constructive ideas 
            for the smooth functioning of a planning system which treats all parties 
            fairly; expresses concern over recent media reports that the Scottish 
            Executive is considering dropping plans to widen rights of appeal 
            in planning; seeks reassurance that the current consultation on wider 
            rights of appeal has not been compromised by these reports; believes 
            that the Executive should genuinely listen to the views of everyone 
            who responds to their current consultation and should actively solicit 
            responses to the consultation from communities who might otherwise 
            fear that a decision has already been taken, and considers this to 
            be a touchstone issue in relation to the Executive's stated commitment 
            to environmental justice.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1526</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School</strong>-That the Parliament 
            regrets the Scottish Executive's failure to reverse the decision by 
            Stirling Council's ruling Labour administration to close Holy Trinity 
            Episcopal Primary School in the top of the town area of the city; 
            regrets the failure of Stirling Council to raise the prospect of closure 
            until immediately after the local authority elections; believes the 
            decision is against the interests of education in Stirling and detrimental 
            to the teaching of children in the city; further believes that the 
            Executive and the local authority have consistently failed to listen 
            to the wishes of parents, the local community and those involved in 
            the school; believes that an adequate case for the closure of the 
            school has failed to be made by either Stirling Council or the Executive, 
            and further believes that the Executive should have used its powers 
            over the closure of denominational schools to ensure that the local 
            authority kept the school open.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1525</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>All 
            Saints Roman Catholic Secondary School, Glasgow</strong>-That the 
            Parliament congratulates All Saints Roman Catholic Secondary School 
            in Glasgow on the successful implementation of its streaming policy 
            which it has concluded has led to an improvement in attainment, discipline 
            and application by pupils at the school and urges other schools to 
            consider the benefits of streaming as a means of improving attainment.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Ted Brocklebank<strong>*</strong>, Alex Johnstone<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1524</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Big 
            Business for Borders Rail</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 
            support given to the restoration of the Waverley Line by major business 
            leaders of BT Scotland, Standard Life, Scottish Widows and the public 
            sector employer, NHS Lothian, the Borders being the only region in 
            Western Europe currently without a railway station and with poor road 
            links; endorses the comments made by Brendan Dick of BT Scotland that 
            the rail link would help to address the needs of the capital in terms 
            of workforce, congestion and &quot;the benefits to the long-term viability 
            of the Borders economy are also clear to see&quot;; further endorses 
            the comments made by Dermot Gorman of NHS Lothian who, as a large 
            employer, welcomes an initiative allowing a pool of people to be available 
            to ease recruitment problems; believes that the railway would open 
            up a new commuter market for vacancies, helping to raise the average 
            earnings in the Borders, currently 21% lower than the Scottish rate, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to stop procrastinating over the 
            business case and to give its unconditional support to the Waverley 
            Line by ensuring that the £130 million funding is provided now.</P>
