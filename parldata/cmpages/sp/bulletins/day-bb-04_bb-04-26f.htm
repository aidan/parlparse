          <p><strong>*S2M-1196</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Amnesty 
            for Poll Tax Debts</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the local 
            authorities that have recently issued bills for poll tax debts from 
            14 years ago; notes that poll tax debts have long been written off 
            as unrecoverable in England and Wales due to the statute of limitation 
            on debt recovery after 10 years; recalls that the poll tax was introduced 
            in Scotland one year before England and Wales, and calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to direct local authorities to write off poll tax debts 
            in Scotland in line with the rest of the United Kingdom.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1195</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Private 
            Prisons</strong>-That the Parliament notes the important progress 
            that has been made by the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) &quot;Bridging 
            the Gap&quot; project and, in particular, the constructive relationship 
            that has developed between the SPS and trade union partners to bid 
            for a second new prison; regrets the decision by the Scottish Executive 
            to contract out the first new build prison to the private sector, 
            therefore denying the public sector the opportunity to openly compete 
            for an important public sector service, and calls on the Executive 
            to reconsider this decision.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1194#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Recognition 
            of Jack Vettriano</strong>-That the Parliament notes the increasing 
            popularity, both at home and abroad, of the Fife-born and bred artist 
            Jack Vettriano; notes the sale by auction of his most recognised work, 
            &quot;The Singing Butler&quot;, for a record amount for a painting 
            sold in Scotland by a Scottish artist; notes with dismay that not 
            one of his works appears in any of our national galleries, and believes 
            that at least one of his paintings should be obtained by one of our 
            national institutions to recognise his contemporary popularity and 
            national significance.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Christine May, Janis Hughes, Rhona Brankin</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1193</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>St 
            Andrew's Church of Scotland, Gibraltar</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that May 2004 marks the 150th anniversary of the opening of 
            St Andrew's Church of Scotland, Gibraltar; recognises the valuable 
            contribution that the church makes to the lives of members of the 
            British military population and other expatriates in Gibraltar, and 
            wishes it success with the numerous events that it has planned this 
            year to celebrate the anniversary.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1192</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Three 
            New Primary Schools in the Falkirk Area</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates Falkirk Council on its decision to build three new primary 
            schools at Stenhousemuir, Larbert and Maddiston; notes that these 
            three new schools will be built without the use of PPP/PFI, and welcomes 
            the fact that the new schools will be owned by the residents of Falkirk 
            District, unlike the five schools built by the previous New Labour 
            administration.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1191</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Joint 
            Marine Programme - The Tangle of the Clyde Report</strong>-That the 
            Parliament welcomes the report by the Joint Marine Programme, <em>The 
            Tangle of the Clyde</em>, revealing the historic mismanagement of 
            the Firth of Clyde and highlighting the tangled web of conflicting 
            and confusing legislation that affects all of Scotland's seas and 
            coasts; notes the unacceptable free-for-all, rather than coherent 
            legal basis, by which the seas are managed; notes the importance of 
            the seas to the Scottish economy; supports the call for a Marine Act 
            for Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take on board 
            the results of this new report in its current consultation on the 
            marine environment in the interests of protecting and restoring both 
            marine life and the livelihoods of coastal communities.</P>

            Harvie, Ms Sandra White, Eleanor Scott, Mark Ballard, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>S2M-1190</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Borders 
            Adult Learner and Students Association</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes Adult Learners' Week as a recognition of the value of learning 
            opportunities across all age groups for individuals and society; applauds 
            those who overcome personal challenges in accessing learning opportunities 
            in adulthood; is aware that there are many reasons why such opportunities 
            are accessed, for example personal or career development; recognises 
            that there are significant barriers to such access, for example transport, 
            accessing childcare and cost; congratulates Borders Adult Learner 
            and Students Association (BALSA) on raising the profile of adult learning 
            in the Borders, and is pleased to acknowledge BALSA's conference on 
            Saturday 8 May 2004 as the start of the process of breaking down the 
            barriers to accessing adult learning opportunities.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1189</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Dunfermline Athletic Football Club</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates Dunfermline Athletic Football Club on reaching the 2004 
            Tennent's Scottish Cup Final; acknowledges that this will be the Pars' 
            first such final since last winning the cup in 1968; notes that the 
            club has qualified for European football for the first time since 
            1970, and wishes all four of Scotland's representatives in next season's 
            European football competitions every success.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Brian Adam, Tommy Sheridan</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1188</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Future 
            of Clyde Boat Building and Marine Facilities</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the historic boat and ship building tradition on the Clyde and 
            the need for comprehensive development of the waterfront that will 
            fully respect and cater for the river's marine heritage and regrets 
            the loss of any existing boat and marine businesses to residential 
            development, such as through the proposals being pursued by Clydeport 
            to develop the area surrounding the Renfrew Ferry including the Clyde 
            River Boat Yard and the &quot;Old Garvel Yard&quot;.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1187#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Promoting 
            Timber Buildings</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Caithness 
            area of Highland Council for promoting the successful seminar &quot;Tomorrow's 
            Houses Today&quot; that explored the possibilities for creating energy-efficient, 
            eco-friendly housing using local materials; notes the participants' 
            conclusions that local timber should be a key component in construction 
            as it offers Scotland the use of a plentiful, renewable resource; 
            further notes the opportunities to create new house styles fit for 
            localised climatic and landscape characteristics, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should quickly respond by reforming planning 
            laws and building regulations to encourage diverse architectural expression 
            through the medium of timber construction for affordable and sustainable 
            homes and public buildings.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1186</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Death 
            of Ronnie Simpson</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its sadness 
            at the sudden passing of Ronnie Simpson; recognises his contribution 
            to national and international football and to goalkeeping from the 
            beginning of his career at Queen's Park Football Club at the age of 
            14, as well as periods at Third Lanark Football Club, Hibernian Football 
            Club and Newcastle United Football Club where he won two FA cup winners' 
            medals, his caps for Scotland and, in particular, his role as the 
            last line of defence in Celtic Football Club's greatest-ever victory 
            when they won the European Cup in 1967, and extends its condolences 
            to his family and friends, including his fellow Lisbon Lions.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1183#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of Queen Mother's Hospital</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            dismay the decision by Greater Glasgow NHS Board to close the Queen 
            Mother's Hospital; further notes that the pioneering work undertaken 
            at this hospital is world-renowned; agrees with many top specialists 
            in this field that the closure of this facility will lead to the lives 
            of new-born babies from Glasgow and around Scotland being placed in 
            jeopardy; believes that it is the duty of the Minister for Health 
            and Community Care to act in the public interest at all times, and 
            considers that the best way to do this would be to reverse this devastating 
            and unwelcome decision.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1182</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> 
            <strong>Successful Completion of A1 Expressway</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the opening of the A1 expressway between Haddington and Dunbar 
            by the First Minister on 14 April 2004; welcomes the fact that this 
            new dual carriageway will improve road safety and reduce travelling 
            times for local and long-distance journeys; congratulates the staff 
            of the Scottish Executive, Balfour Beatty, Carl Bro and all the designers 
            and contractors on the quality of the new road and associated environmental 
            works, and urges the Executive to work up plans to dual the remaining 
            single carriageway sections of the A1 in Scotland and to complete 
            this essential part of the trunk road network of the United Kingdom.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1179</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses' Just Pay Claim</strong>-That the Parliament demands the immediate 
            settlement of the nursery nurses' dispute in light of the news that 
            the UK's richest people have seen their wealth increase by nearly 
            30%; recognises that Scotland's nursery nurses have been denied a 
            national settlement to their just demand for a decent living wage 
            at the same time as the 100 richest Scots are now worth over £11 billion, 
            and regards it as a disgrace that our nursery nurses are having to 
            battle for a decent living wage while the excessively rich sit back 
            and watch their bank balances increase daily.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1178</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Fife Constabulary</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Fife 
            Constabulary for the successful pilot scheme of housing satellite 
            police stations in rural post offices; notes how this programme has 
            benefited communities in Fife by providing a police presence in remote 
            areas as well as maintaining postal services at a time when many rural 
            post offices are being closed, and hopes that this scheme will be 
            rolled out to other rural areas throughout Scotland.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1177</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>National 
            Gallery of Modern Art</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 
            National Gallery of Modern Art for its exhibition of the first ever 
            museum showing of Lucian Freud's complete etchings; recognises that 
            this exhibition provides the public with the opportunity to view a 
            unique collection of works of an outstanding artist, and applauds 
            the gallery for bringing forward exhibitions of this calibre that 
            can only enhance the reputation of Scotland in the field of visual 
            arts.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1176#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Abolish 
            Prescription Charges</strong>-That the Parliament believes that charging 
            patients for their medicines breaches the principle of universally 
            free health care that underpins the NHS; notes that <em>Unhealthy 
            Charges</em>, published by the National Association of Citizens Advice 
            Bureaux in July 2001, indicates that as many as 70,000 Scots per year 
            may have gone without vital medicines because they could not afford 
            the £6.30 charge for each item; believes that the logic behind the 
            charging criteria, with one patient exempt and another with a very 
            similar condition paying in full, cannot be sustained, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should follow the example of the National 
            Assembly for Wales which voted recently to abolish prescription charges.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1145#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>Threat 
            to Jobs at TransBus International</strong>-That the Parliament is 
            gravely concerned about the fact that the Mayflower Corporation has 
            entered administration with a resultant threat to 1,000 jobs at TransBus 
            International in Falkirk and Larbert and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should contact the employees' trade union representatives, 
            the administrator and any prospective buyers to offer assistance and 
            advice so that everything possible is done to try to save the jobs 
            of the TransBus workers who make a very important contribution to 
            the Scottish economy.</P>

            chiropody and foot care in keeping Scotland's elderly population mobile, 
            pain free and independent; considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            specify who is eligible for NHS chiropody and podiatry care, noting 
            that local access policies differ throughout Scotland and promote 
            variances in the provision of foot care, and further considers that 
            NHS boards should ensure that access to foot health services are maintained
