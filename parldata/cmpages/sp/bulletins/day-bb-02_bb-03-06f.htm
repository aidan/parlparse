          <p> <strong>*S1M-2839</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Community Care</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the unequal funding support between local authority 
            and independently run care homes; regrets the exceptionally high levels 
            of delayed discharge within Scotland&#146;s hospitals; believes that 
            the action plan to tackle delayed discharge will not solve the problem 
            until health and social work budgets are unified, and urges the Scottish 
            Executive to implement the recommendation of the Royal Commission 
            chaired by Sir Stewart Sutherland to unify these budgets within a 
            single organisation and put in place systems to ensure that funds 
            allocated for community care are actually spent on such services.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2838</strong> <strong>Iain Gray: Final Report of the

            homelessness in Scotland and endorses the Executive&#146;s pledge 
            to implement the wide-ranging recommendations contained in the final

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2837</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Support for Max 
            Jimmy</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges Max Jimmy as 
            a former journalist for <em>Unity Now</em> from Sierra Leone who is 
            claiming asylum in the UK; recognises his need for National Asylum 
            Support Service (NASS) support whilst he awaits a decision on his 
            asylum claim; is concerned that without vital subsistence support 
            from the NASS he is threatened with destitution and is only managing 
            at present owing to the goodwill of Sierra Leonean friends and small 
            donations from press freedom organisations, and urges the Home Office 
            to reconsider its decision not to provide Max Jimmy with the essential, 
            basic support he needs, while awaiting a decision on his asylum claim.

          <p><strong>*S1M-2836</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Programme for Upgrading

            notes with concern the number of fatal accidents on the A9 trunk road 
            between Inverness and Perth; believes that the configuration of the 
            road, with a mixture of single and dual carriageway, contributes to 
            the accident rate, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to publish 
            a programme for upgrading the A9 to dual carriageway status for its 
            entirety between Perth and Inverness.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2835</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Attention Deficit 
            Hyperactivity Disorder</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the rise in the number of children being prescribed methylphenidates, 
            in particular Ritalin, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; 
            further notes the lack of impartial research into both the use of 
            such drugs in controlling children and the diagnosis and treatment 
            of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and supports the immediate 
            setting up of an independent research project into attention deficit 
            hyperactivity disorder as a diagnosis and the use of methylphenidates 
            in treatment. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2834</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon: Tunes of Glory Piping

            Power and VisitScotland, of the Tunes of Glory Piping Parade being 
            organised by Epic Concepts in aid of Marie Curie Cancer Care and Gilda&#146;s 
            Club Worldwide; notes that pipe bands from all over Scotland will 
            participate in the parade, to be held in New York on Tartan Day, 6 
            April 2002, and further notes that the parade will provide an excellent 
            opportunity to celebrate the historical and present day links that 
            Scots and Americans share and will also provide a valuable opportunity 
            to demonstrate our solidarity with the people of New York following 
            the atrocities of 11 September 2001.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2833</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie: Scotch Whisky

            &quot;support Scottish manufacturers where EU and UK policies have 
            an effect on the competitiveness of Scottish Industry&quot; and &quot;take 
            steps to ensure that the regulatory burden is kept to a sensible minimum&quot;; 
            further notes that Her Majesty&#146;s Government is considering applying 
            tax stamps throughout the UK, a measure described by the Scotch Whisky 
            Association as being &quot;by far the greatest threat that the industry 
            currently faces&quot;, and calls upon the Executive to demonstrate 
            its stated commitment to the industry, to implement its stated pledge 
            and, accordingly, to make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s against 
            the introduction of tax stamps. </a></p>
