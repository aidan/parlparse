          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1625</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Ae Fond Kiss</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates director, Ken Loach, and screenwriter, Paul Laverty, on the production of their thought-provoking film &quot;Ae Fond Kiss&quot; which received its UK premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 22 August 2004; applauds the performances of the cast, particularly the members of the local community in Glasgow who took part in the film, and recognises the economic benefits of a thriving Scottish film industry and the funding provided by the Scottish Executive through Scottish Screen and the Scottish Arts Council which has supported the work of Ken Loach on this film and his previous productions, &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; and &quot;My Name is Joe.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1624</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Glasgow Gaelic Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the principal teacher, staff, pupils and parents of Glasgow Gaelic Primary School (GGPS) on the first class report achieved from HM Inspectorate of Education for the school year 2003-04; notes that on indicators of quality the GGPS achieved over two-thirds of indicators in the very good category and none in the unsatisfactory category, and wishes the GGPS continued success in delivering high quality education in its new premises, commencing in the school year 2004-05.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1623</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Fire (Scotland) Bill - Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Fire (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1622</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Landslip at Glen Ogle</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the bravery, speed and professionalism of the emergency services, RAF and Royal Navy, who took part in the rescue operation following the recent landslip on the A85 at Glen Ogle, rescuing 57 people; also praises the people of Lochearnhead and Killin for the community spirit that saw local people rush to offer assistance to all those involved in the incident; recognises that the risk of such landslips, and flash floods as seen in Boscastle, is likely to increase due to the effects of climate change, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with Stirling Council and other relevant agencies to minimise the risks of such landslips and also ensure that Scotland delivers on its obligations to reduce greenhouse gases in order to tackle the causes of climate change.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1621</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Agenda for Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Agenda for Change, the biggest ever modernisation of pay and conditions in the NHS, is due to be rolled out from 1 December this year; believes that, as part of NHS pay modernisation, Agenda for Change is integral to service modernisation in the NHS; further believes that the recent agreement to defer changes to unsocial hours payments is a welcome pragmatic step and that it is important to acknowledge the need for ongoing testing and work on some areas of the package, but also accepts that there is no &quot;plan B&quot; and that everyone involved with its implementation must continue to work together in true partnership to make it a success, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that it provides the resources needed to implement Agenda for Change in Scotland successfully and that NHS boards deliver it locally.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1620</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>World Suicide Prevention Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises World Suicide Prevention Day on 10 September 2004 and notes that this represents a call for action and involvement by all governments and organisations worldwide to contribute to suicide awareness and prevention through activities, events, conferences and campaigns in each country.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1619</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s BBC Restoration Representatives</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the efforts of all those involved with the campaigns of Hall of Clestrain, Knockando Wool Mill and Portencross Castle, the three Scottish entries on the BBC&rsquo;s <em>Restoration</em> programme; recognises the importance of each building to the architectural heritage of both their local area and Scotland in general, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that all three buildings, and all other historically or architecturally significant buildings in Scotland, are given the support required to ensure a sustainable future.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1618</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Shameless Behaviour of Liberal Democrats on Perth and Kinross Council</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the decision of the Liberal Democrat councillors in Perth and Kinross Council to unilaterally end their coalition with the Conservative and Labour councillors and form a new coalition with the SNP is shameless; believes that this action insults the voters of Perth and Kinross who endorsed the Independent/Conservative/Liberal Democrat/Labour administration at the polls in May 2003; believes that the new coalition is bad news for the people of Perth and Kinross as council tax payers will inevitably see their bills rise under the new administration, and further believes that this behaviour exposes the Liberal Democrats as opportunists who are, at every level, prepared to coalesce with whichever party offers them the best deal with no thought for principle or integrity.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1617</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Swiss-based IMD International of the <em>IMD &ndash; World Competitiveness Yearbook 2004</em>, which includes Scotland as one of its regional cases for the first time; notes that the study ranks Scotland as the 36th most competitive economy out of a total of 60 cases and also places Scotland in 38th place out of 60, nine places behind the United Kingdom as a whole, for the category measuring macro-economic domestic economy; notes that the study concludes that the extent to which government policies are conducive to the competitiveness of the economy places Scotland 39th in the study, Scotland&rsquo;s lowest placing in the league tables behind countries such as Columbia, India, the Slovak Republic and communist China and underlining the damage that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policies are doing to Scotland&rsquo;s competitive position, and believes that, if this Executive is serious about growing the economy as the top priority, then it must take heed of this apolitical third-party report and change its policies to create conditions where business can flourish, which should include lowering business rates, reducing bureaucracy, privatising Scottish Water and investing in a transport infrastructure that can get Scottish goods to market.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1616</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Bus Services to New Parliament Building</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in the absence of any bus service connecting Princes Street or Waverley Station to the new parliament building, any prospect of one or of an improved walking route, calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body urgently to arrange for a shuttle bus service, using an appropriate small or medium size of bus, to run between Waverley Station and the Parliament to facilitate the use of train and bus services by MSPs, staff and visitors to the Parliament, using one of the available routes, such as Waverley Bridge, Market Street, New Street, Calton Road, Canongate and back via New Street and Market Street or via North Bridge and Princes Street.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1615</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Award Won by Caldervale High School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils and staff of Caldervale High School in Airdrie on their recent success in winning the Scottish Creative Spaces competition, which is organised by CITB-ConstructionSkills and which encourages pupils to redesign an area of their school, and recognises the benefits of engaging young people at an early stage in the design and construction industries.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1614</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Loss of Scottish Teletext Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament strongly disapproves of the actions of Teletext in ceasing the broadcast of a separate Scottish national news service with the incumbent loss of nine of the 14 jobs at present in their Glasgow office; recognises that this means a diminution of quality of service for Scotland, and urges Teletext to reconsider this move and to keep at least one Scottish editor in Glasgow to ensure that the Scottish Teletext service remains monitored and edited within Scotland and not from London, as will be the outcome of this proposal.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1613</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Low Frequency Sonar Systems Threat to Whales and Dolphins</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep concern over the use of low frequency sonar systems by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) which could cause death and distress to whales and dolphins around Scotland&rsquo;s coasts; notes the legal move by the United States of America which has seen the US Navy banned from deploying low frequency sonar systems; considers that the certain impact of deployment of low frequency sonar on Scotland&rsquo;s inshore environment is an issue that is devolved to the Scottish Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Executive to seek legal advice with a view to instituting legal proceedings against the MoD over its plan to deploy the &pound;340 million sonar system.</p>
