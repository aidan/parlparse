          <p>The clerk has been advised of the topic for the following Scottish National Party Business</p>
          <p>9.30 am&#9;Scottish National Party Debate on the European Constitution-</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-1218</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>European Constitution</strong>-That the Parliament calls on Her Majesty's Government to negotiate out of the draft EU Constitution the clause stipulating that the European Union shall have exclusive competence over the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy, and ensure that the final draft of the Constitution is not detrimental to Scottish interests. 
            <em><strong> </strong></em> </p>
<p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p><strong>S2M-1218.4</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: European Constitution</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1218) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;negotiate&quot; to end and insert &quot;agree a Treaty that, in the context of an enlarging Union, is clearer and simpler than the existing treaties, to bring the European Union closer to the citizens of Europe; notes that the current draft Treaty simply makes explicit the European Community's exclusive competence over marine conservation as set out in the United Kingdom's Treaty of Accession, as part of the Common Fisheries Policy, which both Her Majesty's Government and the Scottish Executive are committed to reform to deliver effective regional management of, and a sustainable future for, Scotland's fishing industry; notes that the text makes reference for the first time to the role of sub-national parliaments and offers enhanced scope for collaboration to tackle international crime and the threat of terrorism, and welcomes the benefits to Scotland of EU membership, including economic prosperity, trade, environmental and consumer protection and citizens' and workers' rights.&quot;</p>
              <p><strong>S2M-1218.1</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: European Constitution</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1218) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that the only way to ensure a sustainable future for the Scottish fishing industry is to restore national and local control of Scottish waters by negotiating withdrawal from the Common Fisheries Policy and calls on Her Majesty's Government to hold the referendum on the EU Constitution following final agreement of its terms to give our people the opportunity to reject this centralising constitution and help to shape a new, flexible Europe of nation states working in partnership.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1218.3</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: European Constitution</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1218) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that management of fisheries, as a shared resource in the seas around Europe, transcends national boundaries; condemns the long history of Common Fisheries Policy management driven by political rather than scientific considerations; recognises that such political management has led to the current plight of fish stocks and fishing communities; agrees that the newly-reformed Common Fisheries Policy offers a brighter future given the proposals for conservation of stocks based on scientific analysis combined with fishermen's expertise to agree sustainable managements on a regional basis, and calls on the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government not to abandon the goal of sustainable management of fisheries and to engage actively in negotiations to ensure that the final draft of the Constitution is not detrimental to Scottish interests on fisheries, renewable energy and other matters.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-1218.2</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: European Constitution</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1218) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from &quot;negotiate&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognise that the European Constitution makes fundamental changes to the structures of the European Union that will further erode local and national democracy, strengthen the grip of the largest and wealthiest nation states of Europe at the expense of the smaller nations and stateless nations, undermine public services in Scotland by opening the door to wholesale privatisation, jeopardise the existence of our fishing industry by engraving in stone the disastrous Common Fisheries Policy, transfer powers over energy to the EU which in turn can be used to block any future moves to bring our oil, gas, and electricity industries into public ownership, lead to a further militarisation of the European continent and give carte blanche to large multi-national states such as Spain and the United Kingdom to deny minority nations within these states the right to genuine self-determination, and, in the light of the damage that this constitution will do to Scotland's present and future interests and given that opposition to the proposed constitution is even stronger in Scotland than the rest of the UK, calls on Her Majesty's Government to call a separate referendum for Scotland.&quot; </p>
