the Parliament commends the Royal Fine Arts Commission of Scotland (RFACS) in 
its efforts to communicate to the widest possible audience an account of its activity 
and financial affairs on a year-to-year basis at minimum cost in both financial 
and environmental terms and considers that other publicly funded bodies should 
examine the RFACS methods with a view to establishing similar good practice.</P><P>Supported

<STRONG>S1M-3969#</STRONG> <STRONG>Angus MacKay: 20th Anniversary of the Recognition 
of HIV/AIDS</STRONG>-That the Parliament notes that 2003 marks the 20th anniversary 
of the discovery of HIV as being the virus that leads to AIDS; further notes that 
at the end of 2002 the United Nations estimated that over 40 million people had 
been infected with the virus and many millions more affected by it; acknowledges 
that Scotland, and Edinburgh in particular, were seen as being at the forefront 
of the epidemic in the early 1980s; recognises the achievements of voluntary and 
statutory organisations involved in limiting the impact of HIV/AIDS in Scotland; 
further recognises that the current epidemic is particularly virulent in sub-Saharan 
Africa where over 25 million people are infected with the virus, and encourages 
Scottish organisations and institutions working on HIV/AIDS to develop partnerships 
with similar organisations in southern Africa to share expertise and encourage 
mutual understanding of how best to care for people with HIV and to maximise our 
efforts at preventing further transmissions of HIV.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3968#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Shona Robison: Broughty Ferry Beach</STRONG>-That the Parliament notes 
that Broughty Ferry beach has not been recognised as a designated bathing beach 
by the Scottish Executive; recognises that the lack of such a designation has 
resulted in the beach being omitted from the European Commission's bathing waters 
website; notes that this has a detrimental impact on tourism as well as on the 
environment, and congratulates the local community for its hard work in organising 
beach clean-ups.</P><P>Supported by: Ms Sandra White<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>S1M-3967</STRONG> <STRONG>Richard Lochhead: The Sea Fishing (Restriction

<STRONG>Michael Russell: Death of Fred MacAulay/Fred MhicAmhlaidh</STRONG>-That 
the Parliament records with sadness the death of Fred MacAulay who as a broadcaster 
and broadcasting manager fought to maintain and expand the position of the Gaelic 
language in the Scottish media and in Scottish life, whose efforts over many years 
resulted in a huge expansion of Gaelic radio and television compared to the service 
as it was when he first became involved and whose wit, scholarship, enthusiasm 
and dedication to his own people, his language and his culture have acted; and 
will act, as a spur to many others and commends his example of courage and determination 
to all those who presently work for the language and its future.</P><P><EM> The

<STRONG>S1M-3965#</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: War Pensioners' Accommodation 
at Erskine Hospital</STRONG>-That the Parliament condemns the withdrawal of rent-free 
status for those war pensioners living in the grounds of Erskine Hospital and 
considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate the financial circumstances 
that have led to the withdrawal of their rent-free accommodation with a view to 
reinstating this concession in recognition of the heroism and sacrifice of these 
former soldiers.</P><P>Supported by: Robin Harper, Dorothy-Grace Elder<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>S1M-3964#</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: No Smoking Day 2003</STRONG>-That 
the Parliament notes that No Smoking Day will take place on 12 March 2003; recognises 
that tobacco is responsible for more than one in every five deaths and is the 
single biggest preventable cause of death in Scotland; further notes the evidence 
that people consistently underestimate the health impacts of both smoking and 
passive smoking; recognises that the introduction of restrictions on smoking in 
the workplace is effective in motivating smokers to quit; acknowledges that cutting 
smoking rates in Scotland will reduce the high incidence of cancer and heart disease 
caused by smoking and passive smoking; supports the work done by agencies who 
campaign against tobacco in Scotland and the UK; applauds the work of health professionals 
in helping smokers to give up, and congratulates the 120,000 Scots who are expected 
to make a quit attempt on No Smoking Day 2003.</P><P>Supported by: Robin Harper,

<STRONG>S1M-3962</STRONG> <STRONG>Rhoda Grant: Arjo Wiggins Development of Heat 
and Power Generator</STRONG>-That the Parliament welcomes the safeguarding of 
the jobs of 175 employees at Arjo Wiggins, Lochaber, with the allocation of a 
£5 million grant from the Department of Trade and Industry and the New Opportunities 
Fund under the Bio-Energy Capital Grant Scheme to build a combined heat and power 
generator; congratulates the company on its visionary plans to build such a generator 
that will make its plant energy self-sufficient; notes that the generator will 
require 106,000 tonnes of wood fuel each year, and further notes the positive 
knock-on impact that this development will have on the forestry industry in Scotland.</P><P>Supported 
by: Robin Harper, Sarah Boyack, Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3961#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Jackie Baillie: Reform of Charity Law</STRONG>-That the Parliament shares 
the Scottish Executive's commitment to progressing the reform of charity law; 
recognises that this will assist in developing the contribution of charities to 
their communities; notes the voluntary sector's call for a charities bill, and 
welcomes the Executive's commitment to keep the need for such legislation under 
review.</P><P>Supported by: Scott Barrie, Cathie Craigie, Brian Fitzpatrick, Margaret

<STRONG>S1M-3960</STRONG> <STRONG>Michael Russell: 700th Anniversary of the Battle 
of Roslin</STRONG>-That the Parliament remembers, on the 700th anniversary of 
their sacrifice, those who died on both sides at the Battle of Roslin on 24 February 
1303; notes that what has been called Scotland's forgotten battle was of enormous 
significance in the process of defending and then firmly establishing the independence 
of Scotland at a crucial time in its history, and commends the efforts of those 
who are endeavouring to ensure that the significance of the Battle of Roslin is 
at last understood and that the event is properly commemorated.</P><P>Supported

<STRONG>Janis Hughes: Reorganisation of Post Offices</STRONG>-That the Parliament 
notes the value of sub-post offices to local communities, particularly in deprived 
areas; welcomes Her Majesty's Government's decision to provide funding to compensate 
local sub-postmasters for the cost of closures and to improve remaining post offices; 
acknowledges that, whilst there is not enough business to sustain the current 
number of post office branches, cognisance must be taken of local need and a growing 
elderly population, and urges the Post Office to ensure that full consultation 
takes place, taking into account the needs of local communities and involving 
local residents and elected representatives, over changes to local provision.</P><P>Supported

Trish Godman, Robin Harper, Margaret Jamieson, Sarah Boyack, Scott Barrie</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3954</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Murdo Fraser: Effective Deer Management</STRONG>-That the Parliament welcomes 
the introduction of a new working agreement between the Association of Deer Management 
Groups, the Deer Commission for Scotland, the Forestry Commission and Scottish 
Natural Heritage that will enable all four bodies to work together to provide 
a framework for good communication and mutual understanding in the interests of 
effective deer management; notes the necessity of bringing Scotland's deer populations 
into sustainable balance with their environment, and believes that the new arrangements 
represent a major contribution towards that end.</P><P>Supported by: Robin Harper</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3953#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Dr Richard Simpson: New Forth Road Bridge Crossing Near Kincardine</STRONG>-That 
the Parliament welcomes the completion of the A907; notes the current intention 
of the Scottish Executive to reopen the Stirling to Alloa and Kincardine rail 
link by 2005 and construct a new Forth road bridge crossing by 2007; further notes 
the benefits to the economy of Clackmannanshire that will result from these infrastructure 
improvements; notes, however, that the recent decision for the favoured site of 
a new acute hospital for Forth Valley to be at the Royal Scottish National Hospital, 
Larbert, will have significant implications for the road networks to the south 
of the Forth road crossing, and considers that the Executive should ensure that 
the design of this network and its date of completion are expedited in order to 
ensure the safety of patients in Ochil and Stirling constituencies as well as 
those from the west of Fife.</P><P>Supported by: Scott Barrie, Mr Brian Monteith</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3945</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) 
Bill - Consultation</STRONG>-That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive 
has published the draft Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) 
Bill with the express purpose of modernising the framework that provides pupils 
that need additional support for learning with that support and that the bill 
has been put out to consultation with parents, professionals and other stakeholders 
for a ten-week period ending on 28 March 2003; further notes that the draft bill 
proposes that the Record of Needs be discontinued and replaced by a new Co-ordinated 
Support Plan &quot;for children with complex or multiple barriers to learning 
who require additional support from outwith the education authority&quot;; believes 
that this bill represents significant and fundamental changes to the existing 
service built up over the last 20 years and that for it to be successful it must 
enjoy the support of those parents whose children already have a Record of Needs; 
notes that the Executive's main method of communicating the bill's proposals to 
such parents is to send a copy of the document to all schools, asking them to 
pass it on to these parents and, in addition, is holding a number of seminars 
that parents can attend; further notes that many parents are expressing ignorance 
of the draft bill, its contents and the consultation process and that attendance 
by parents at these seminars is worryingly low and often in single figures, compared 
to the large number of well-informed professionals, and therefore supports the 
extension of the consultation period until after the summer recess of the next 
parliamentary session so that all parents have ample opportunity to consider the 
merits and demerits of these radical changes and communicate their views to the 
new Executive which, in turn, will be able to assess its consultation in a more 
considered manner and with an accurate response from parents.</P><P>Supported 
by: Phil Gallie, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh, Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3942</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Brian Adam: Chewing Gum Disposal</STRONG>-That the Parliament applauds 
Councillor Kevin Stewart and Aberdeen City Council in their endeavours to try 
and get the Chancellor of the Exchequer's agreement to introduce a levy on chewing 
gum manufacturers, the proceeds of which would be allocated to local authorities 
to clean up the mess created by those who discard their gum on our streets and 
pavements; notes that other local authorities are backing Councillor Stewart's 
original motion because cleaning up chewing gum costs millions of pounds each 
year, and furthermore believes that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should introduce 
this sensible proposal in his forthcoming budget.</P><P>Supported by: Michael 
Matheson, Kay Ullrich, Robin Harper, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Mr Adam Ingram, Colin 
Campbell, Fiona Hyslop, Richard Lochhead, Stewart Stevenson, Christine Grahame, 
Ms Sandra White, Tommy Sheridan</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3941#</STRONG> <STRONG>Christine 
Grahame: Children of Iraq - Collateral Damage</STRONG>-That the Parliament notes 
the concerns of Save the Children regarding the humanitarian consequences of military 
action against Iraq, that half the Iraqi population is comprised of children under 
the age of 14, that 70% of the population lives in towns and cities, that 60% 
are poor and dependent on food rations, that 11.4% of Iraqi children in North 
Iraq and 23.1% in Central and South Iraq are still chronically malnourished, that 
under-five child mortality in Central and South Iraq has deteriorated by 160% 
due to sanctions, that a cut in the food ration provided under the Oil-for-Food 
programme would trigger even greater poverty, that Iraqi children are forced to 
drink water that often contains up to ten times the acceptable level of contamination 
and that the number of internally-displaced persons is already estimated to be 
between 700,000 and one million; further notes that, against this background, 
Save the Children is "deeply concerned" at the possibility of renewed conflict 
as military action would have serious humanitarian consequences for Iraq's vulnerable 
children, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make all possible representations 
to prevent this war by addressing the likely impact on the vulnerable and innocent 
children of Iraq.</P><P>Supported by: Brian Adam, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Michael

on the Upper and Lower Clyde</STRONG>-That the Parliament, in the light of recent 
and forthcoming Ministry of Defence contracts, is confident that the shipyards 
on the upper and lower Clyde have a sound future with the welcome retention, and 
expansion in the range of the superb skills that characterise the industry at 
its best and believes, however, that these yards, from Port Glasgow to Scotstoun 
and Govan, require from time to time appropriate and judicious support from the 
Scottish Executive in order to strengthen this now small but vitally important 
industry and that this can be best achieved by strengthening the existing close 
working relationship with management and the trade unions.</P><P>Supported by:

notes that millions of people use food supplements and herbal remedies in the

food supplements that will firstly reduce the numbers of supplements offered and 
secondly reduce the potency of those which remain, and, whilst noting Her Majesty's 
Government's assurances that such supplements will be treated as favourably as 
possible under UK law, considers that the Scottish Executive should do everything
