          <p>9.30 am&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate on Reform 
            of Public Services-</P>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><strong>S2M-718</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Reform 
              of Public Services</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the 
              increased levels of spending on our public services, but notes that 
              this has not been reflected in improved standards of service; recognises 
              that fundamental reform is needed of public services in Scotland 
              to achieve the standards of many other European countries and provide 
              value for money for our taxpayers; calls, therefore, on the Scottish 
              Executive to give patients genuine choice over the treatment they 
              receive, establish foundation hospitals within the NHS in Scotland 
              and promote the development of, and partnership with, the independent 
              sector; calls on the Executive to expand choice and diversity in 
              education by enabling taxpayers' money to follow children to the 
              schools of their parents' choice and develop a network of state-funded 
              but independently managed schools, and further calls on the Executive 
              to enhance local accountability in respect of the provision of police 
              services by the direct election of conveners of police boards. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><strong>S2M-718.3</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock: Reform of Public 
              Services</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-718) in the name 
              of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end 
              and insert &quot;supports the radical, demanding and relevant agenda 
              set out in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> including 
              the delivery of excellent public services that put patients, pupils 
              and victims first, ensure equality of access across urban and rural 
              Scotland, devolve decision-making to front-line staff, establish 
              national standards on which local excellence can be built, backed 
              by inspection, and share best practice and action to tackle and 
              turn around poor performance.&quot; </p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-718.1</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Reform of Public 
              Services</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-718) in the name 
              of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end 
              and insert &quot;rejects the proposals by the Conservative Party 
              to privatise our public services and deplores the continued use 
              of PPP/PFI to fund our public services by the current Labour/Liberal 
              Democrat Scottish Executive; believes that the developing crisis 
              in the NHS will only be addressed by increasing the capacity of 
              the NHS to treat more patients and reduce waiting times through 
              effective policies to recruit and retain staff within the NHS in 
              Scotland, and calls for a national debate on the way forward for 
              the health service in Scotland.&quot; </p>
            <p> <strong>S2M-718.2</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Reform of Public 
              Services</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-718) in the name 
              of David McLetchie, leave out from second &quot;the&quot; to end 
              and insert &quot;the crucial role played by low-paid public sector 
              workers in delivering high quality services in often stressful situations; 
              notes however, that they are poorly rewarded for their efforts; 
              recognises that the time has come for radical reform of public services 
              so that they can play a fuller role in eradicating poverty and social 
              exclusion; believes, therefore, that the Scottish Executive should 
              reverse the privatisation of public services involved in PFI and 
              PPP and ensure that all public services are directing their main 
              efforts into reducing the inequalities caused by poverty and discrimination, 
              and further believes that the Executive should introduce a £7.50 
              an hour minimum pay level for all public sector workers in Scotland, 
              call a moratorium on the centralisation of hospital services which 
              reduces access to maternity, accident and emergency and other health 
              services for those living in our most deprived and isolated communities 
              and instigate a full, democratic and inclusive public debate to 
              establish the real health needs of communities and the resources 
              and measures required to meet those needs.&quot; </p>
