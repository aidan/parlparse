          <p><em>&#9;</em>Debate on the subject of-</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-728</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>General 
            Medical Services Contracts</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            that the provisions made for contracting-out out-of-hours care from 
            GPs to local NHS boards may be insufficiently funded to meet the unique 
            challenges encountered in rural practices; believes that rural practices 
            thus unable to opt out will have serious difficulty in recruiting 
            new doctors, and considers that the Scottish Executive should re-examine 
            the level of funding allocated to NHS boards providing these services 
            in rural areas. </p>
