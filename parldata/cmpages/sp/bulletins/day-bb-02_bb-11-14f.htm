          <p><strong>*S1M-3580#</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken: Glasgow Acute Health 
            Services Review</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continued and 
            growing concern of Glasgow residents regarding the Scottish Executive's 
            proposals following the recent Acute Health Services Review in Glasgow.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3579</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Centre of Excellence 
            in Genealogy</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the long-established 
            position of Scotland as a country with a history of genealogical research, 
            development and expertise; notes recent technological developments 
            in the study of genealogy which will allow greater access to Scotland's 
            excellent records; congratulates the General Register Office for Scotland 
            on its digitising programme, and urges the Scottish Executive to facilitate 
            the emergence of Scotland as a leading centre in Europe for the academic 
            study of family history research and genealogy by building partnerships 
            with all organisations that hold records of interest in Scotland to 
            maximise public access.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3578#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Bah Humbug</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that the advertising, promotion and sale of Christmas 
            as a commercial calendar event is now encroaching earlier and earlier 
            in the year and that such activities put unacceptable pressures particularly 
            on parents with young children, leading some understandably into financial 
            difficulties; further notes that retail staff and shoppers are subjected 
            to endless jingles before even Halloween masks have been reduced to 
            half price and pumpkins are buy one get six free, and therefore urges 
            the Scottish Executive to take such steps as are required to consign 
            Christmas to where it belongs, no earlier than the month of December.</p>

            leave out from &quot;deplores&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises 
            that poverty and vulnerability are still too widespread in 21st century 
            Scotland, despite the fact that much material poverty has been alleviated, 
            and believes that tackling modern forms of vulnerability requires 
            policies that create wealth and provide economic opportunity and security 
            for all, which can only happen within a framework of public order 
            in which people have the security of strong families, communities

            the Scottish Executive's plans to tackle poverty as set out in <em>Closing 
            the Opportunity Gap: Scottish Budget 2003-2006</em>; agrees that the 
            definition of poverty extends beyond low income to include lack of 
            opportunity in aspects of people's lives such as jobs, health, education, 
            transport and housing, and welcomes the progress that the Executive 
            is making in tackling poverty in the broadest sense, in order to close 
            the opportunity gap for the most disadvantaged people and communities, 
            both urban and rural, across Scotland.&quot; </p>

            Crime</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3569) in the name of 
            Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from &quot;and calls on&quot; to end 
            and insert &quot;regrets that the Scottish Executive has presided 
            over rising crime and rising fear of crime; regrets that the Executive 
            is only committed to &quot;maintaining the capacity of the police&quot; 
            and not increasing the number of police officers on our streets; regrets 
            that the Executive has chosen to focus on politically correct issues 
            such as smacking, and calls on the Executive to address the real issues 
            of concern to the Scottish public by increasing the number of police 
            officers and procurators fiscal, overhauling the youth justice system 
            and dealing adequately with the drugs problem that blights our communities.&quot;</p>

            leave out from &quot;and calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes 
            the commitment of the Scottish Executive to systematic reappraisal 
            of the way in which justice is delivered, building on the system's 
            strengths but also addressing the need for improvement; supports the 
            major programme of modernisation, investment and review being undertaken 
            by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service; awaits with interest 
            the outcome of the major reviews of the criminal justice system currently 
            being conducted by Lord Bonomy and Sheriff Principal McInnes and the 
            work on integration of the system's objectives being undertaken by 
            the Crown Agent, Andrew Normand, and agrees that these reviews should 
            inform proposals for the further improvement and modernisation of 
            the criminal justice system to ensure that justice in Scotland is 
            delivered in a fair, effective and appropriate manner.&quot;</p>
