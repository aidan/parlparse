<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00256 Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Establishment of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament shall establish a committee of the Parliament as follows:</p>
<p>Name of Committee: Scotland Bill Committee</p>
<p>Remit: To consider the Scotland Bill, proposed amendments to the Bill, responses to the report of the Session 3 Scotland Bill Committee and to report to the Parliament.</p>
<p>Duration: Until the Scotland Bill has received Royal Assent, falls or is withdrawn</p>
<p>Number of members: 11</p>
<p>Convenership: The Convener will be a member of the Scottish National Party and the Deputy Convener will be a member of the Scottish Labour Party.</p>
<p>Membership: Richard Baker, Nigel Don, Linda Fabiani, Adam Ingram, Alison Johnstone, James Kelly, John Mason, Stewart Maxwell, Joan McAlpine, David McLetchie, Willie Rennie</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00254 Hanzala Malik: Promoting Small and Local Businesses in the Procurement Process</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the &pound;9 billion that the public sector spends on goods and services annually could be a powerful force in developing local economies; believes that all buying bodies should strive to increase their percentage spend with Scottish small businesses and recognises that the aggregation of contracts poses a threat to this objective, and encourages the development of nationwide business support to ensure that Scottish small businesses can compete with large multinationals.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00253 Marco Biagi: Preservation of Former Clerk Street Odeon</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision of Edinburgh City Council to reject planning applications with regard to the former Odeon Cinema on Clerk Street; recognises the importance of the building&rsquo;s famous art deco design and historic auditorium to the local community and praises the efforts of local campaigners who worked hard to save the building; acknowledges that such efforts, and their subsequent success, are a testament to the significance of Edinburgh&rsquo;s architectural history in the local and national community; believes that the continued presence of the building will play a part of this legacy, and looks forward to the Odeon&rsquo;s restoration at the soonest possible opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00252 George Adam: Former Paisley-Mill Worker&rsquo;s Son Raises Awareness of People with Dementia and their Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the efforts of Tommy Whitelaw in raising awareness of the varying forms of dementia and the condition&rsquo;s effects on families and carers; notes that Tommy is on a 150-mile trek across Scotland, visiting some of the nation&rsquo;s landmarks to highlight the roles played by those caring for someone with the condition, including Tommy&rsquo;s mother, a former mill worker from Paisley; further notes the wide support that Tommy is receiving from organisations including Alzheimer Scotland, Carers Scotland, local groups, employers, football clubs and schools, and acknowledges the innovative step of collecting letters from carers during the hike, detailing their experiences.</p>
