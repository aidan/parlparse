<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5284</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Establishment of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to establish a committee of the Parliament as follows&mdash;</p>
<p>Name of Committee: Ure Elder Fund Transfer and Dissolution Bill Committee;</p>
<p>Remit: To consider and report to the Parliament on the Ure Elder Fund Transfer and Dissolution Bill; </p>
<p>Duration: Until the Bill has received Royal Assent, falls or is withdrawn; </p>
<p>Convenership: The Convener will be a member of the Scottish Labour Party and the Deputy Convener will be a member of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Membership: Nanette Milne, Shirley-Anne Somerville, David Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5283</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Credit Card Theft</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament urges retailers to review existing security screening and warning notices around checkout areas where chip and pin devices are used and to focus on the need for increased security for customers who are older, have young children or are disabled in order that the festive season does not provide opportunities for criminals actively targeting these groups by means of credit card theft and fraud.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5282</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Parliament&rsquo;s Mole Hunters</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the work of Skin Care Campaign Scotland in organising the Mole Hunters event at which more than 10% of the people on the Parliament campus had their moles checked for malignancy; considers that there is a need to change patient referral times to urgent in all cases of suspected melanomas, recognising that swift diagnosis is essential; congratulates clinicians in the NHS Lanarkshire phototriage, where there is high-quality digital imaging with medical photographers that has improved the early diagnosis and treatment of malignant melanomas, and hopes that the Scottish Government will agree to the call of Skin Care Campaign Scotland that urgent action be taken to co-ordinate a major awareness-raising campaign for recognition of moles that may have changed appearance and may be malignant, knowing of the high mortality rates for such cancerous tumours.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5281</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Alloa Community Enterprises</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Alloa Community Enterprises (ACE) on its recent success on being named Large Best Scottish Social Enterprise in the Social Enterprise Coalition Awards in recognition of its continuing hard work in the community and success in recycling; considers that the success of ACE has been built on a strong partnership with local authorities and businesses and has provided jobs for the local community in Clackmannanshire; believes that ACE&rsquo;s activities have, in large part, led to Clackmannanshire Council remaining at the top of the table for best recycling rates in Scotland; wishes the company well for the future and hopes that its achievements will be recognised in the UK final of the Social Enterprise Coalition Awards, to be held in London on 3 December 2009, and further hopes that the company will continue to lead the way in environmental awareness and supporting the social needs of the local community as a business that other companies can aspire to.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5280</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Dear Mister Burns, Irvine Burns Club Exhibition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Irvine Burns Club on its Dear Mister Burns exhibition, the first ever public display of handwritten letters to the club; notes that among the collection, dating from 1828 to the present day, are letters from honorary members such as Charles Dickens, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Theodore Roosevelt, Sir Sean Connery, John Galt, JM Barrie, Sir Alexander Fleming and the first four First Ministers of the Scottish Parliament; welcomes the decision by the Irvine Burns Club to make this collection available to be viewed by the public; further notes that the exhibition forms part of a four-day celebration in Irvine to mark the end of the Year of Homecoming and to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns and will include a range of events for both local people and visitors, including music and drama, ceilidhs and concerts; agrees that this event will raise awareness of the work and influence of Burns both in Scotland and elsewhere, and therefore recognises the global legacy of the work of Robert Burns.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5279</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>The Big Issue, Real Lives, Real Achievements</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Big Issue Real Lives, Real Achievements Awards Ceremony was held in Glasgow on Tuesday 24 November 2009; congratulates Barry Greenan, Scott Lawrie, Joan Anderson and Peter Corstorphine on winning Vendor awards; notes that <em>The Big Issue Scotland</em> is the best-selling news and arts weekly magazine in Scotland, that it has over 500 vendors working across the country and has helped change hundreds of lives for the better in the last 15 years, and looks forward to the Big Issue Foundation Scotland being able to secure the finances required to expand its work and provide additional services in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5278</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Coalfields Regeneration Trust in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the evaluation by EKOS of the work of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust (CRT) in Scotland over the last 10 years; welcomes the channelling of more than &pound;15 million over that period into coalfield areas by the CRT in Scotland; notes that for every &pound;1 of CRT investment in project activity since 2005, an additional &pound;1.37 of funding from other sources has been secured; is concerned that despite the excellent work of the CRT the study found that deprivation in Scotland is still disproportionately concentrated in coalfield communities, with particular inequalities evident in relation to income, employment and skills, and considers that further investment is needed in Scotland&rsquo;s former coalfield communities if the economic and social challenges in these areas are to be fully addressed.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5277</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid Census</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid census day statistics, collected over a 24-hour period on 24 September 2009; notes that, on this day, Women&rsquo;s Aid groups across Scotland supported 642 women and 307 children and young people, that 412 women and 391 children and young people needed the safety of women&rsquo;s aid refuge, that 31 of the 47 women who requested refuge on this day could not be accommodated and that 12 had to be turned away due to a lack of space; notes that 101 women contacted Women&rsquo;s Aid for the first time on this day; reaffirms the importance of Women&rsquo;s Aid&rsquo;s specialist support for women; expresses concern about the removal of ring-fenced funding and the increased funding pressures that local authorities face, and calls for a stronger commitment, matched by funding, to ensure that women, children and young people can live their lives safe in the knowledge that they will be supported by specialist domestic abuse services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5276</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Twechar Language and Communication Resource</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Twechar Language and Communication Resource in East Dunbartonshire for receiving a fantastic HM Inspectorate of Education report; notes that the resource received seven very good ratings and one good rating; further notes that the resource received praise for its contribution of speech and language therapists and leadership of improvement by the manager and principal teacher, and acknowledges the hard work of all those involved in the resource and hopes that it goes from strength to strength.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-5274&diams; </strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Leaked Documents Raise Serious Questions about Iraq Conflict</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with serious concern the publication of leaked documents and post-operational reports regarding the conflict in Iraq; further notes that these documents appear to suggest that planning for UK&nbsp;military activity in Iraq had been taking place since February 2002, while UK Government ministers denied that such planning was taking place; notes the widespread opposition to the war in the&nbsp;south of Scotland region and across the country as a whole,<font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;</font>and&nbsp;would welcome&nbsp;the examination of these documents,&nbsp;along with any and all other evidence about the build-up to the conflict, the conflict itself and its aftermath and that, should evidence emerge of wrongdoing and illegality in decision making, those responsible be held to account.</p>
