          <p>The Presiding Officer wishes to announce that subject to the Parliament's 
            approval of Business Motion S1M-2890 set out below, today's Business 
            will be as follows:</p>
          <p>9.30 am&#9;Debate on Nuclear Power Stations- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2883</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Nuclear 
            Power Stations</strong>-That the Parliament notes that consent for 
            nuclear and other electricity power stations over 50 megawatts, under 
            section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, is a responsibility devolved 
            to Scottish Executive Ministers and believes that the final decision 
            over consent for nuclear power stations, now and in the future, must 
            remain with Scottish Executive Ministers accountable to the Parliament. 
          </p>

              consent for nuclear and other electricity power stations over 50 
              megawatts under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, is a responsibility 
              devolved to Scottish Executive Ministers, but further notes that 
              responsibility for UK energy policy is a matter for Westminster 
              to decide and calls on Her Majesty's Government and the Scottish 
              Executive to clarify unresolved issues in relation to the division 
              of responsibilities in pursuit of a balanced sustainable energy 
              policy.&quot; </p>

          <p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Debate on the National Health Service- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2882</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>National 
            Health Service</strong>-That the Parliament notes that there are fewer 
            nurses and fewer acute beds in the NHS now than in 1999, that the 
            NHS is treating fewer out-patients, in-patients and day case patients 
            now than in 1999, that fewer patients are being seen within the Scottish 
            Executive's target times than was the case in 1999, that there are 
            16,000 more people on NHS waiting lists now than in 1999 and that 
            median waiting times are 10 days longer than in 1999; is concerned 
            that the NHS is shrinking, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to 
            pursue policies that will reverse this reduction in capacity and deliver 
            an NHS of the standard that patients in Scotland are entitled to expect. 
          </p>
