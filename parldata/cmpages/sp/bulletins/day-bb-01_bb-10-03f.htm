          <p><strong>*S1M-2285</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson: Sports Promotion 
            in Scotland's Schools</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the 
            contribution sport makes to both the physical and mental health of 
            young people as well as providing a positive and attractive alternative 
            to anti-social and offending behaviour; endorses the various initiatives, 
            such as the School Sports Co-ordinator and Active Primary School Programmes 
            put in place by the Scottish Executive through <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
            and the increasing opportunities for young people to participate in 
            sports in schools, and calls on local authorities, and others, to 
            engage fully with these initiatives.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2284#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Recognition 
            of Parkinson's Disease</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that 
            Parkinson&#146;s Disease is a progressive neurological condition affecting 
            13,500 people across Scotland and that one in seven people diagnosed 
            will be under the age of 50; notes that every element of normal movement, 
            speech and swallowing is affected by the disease, which often has 
            a devastating impact on both immediate and extended family; believes 
            it is important to establish models of good clinical and social care; 
            further recognises and commends the excellent work being done by the 
            Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society in helping people and their carers 
            with problems arising from the disease, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should as a matter of urgency establish a national network 
            of Parkinson&#146;s Disease specialist nurses to provide a national 
            service framework for neurological conditions including Parkinson&#146;s 
            Disease and should eliminate any inequities in health and social care 
            access in areas such as Glasgow, Ayrshire, Lanarkshire and the Highlands 
            and Islands where the shortage of specialist nurses is most acute.</p>
