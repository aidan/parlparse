<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2139</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Linda MacDonald on Winning the William Y Darling Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh Midwife, Linda MacDonald from charity Malawi Underprivileged Mothers (MUMS), on winning the William Y Darling award for Edinburgh Citizen of the Year through her work for underprivileged mothers and babies in Malawi; recognises her achievement in raising over &pound;125,000 for the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV and the construction of a new maternity wing at Bwaili Hospital, Lilongwe; acknowledges the importance of aid projects of this kind to Malawi and other developing countries, and wishes Mrs MacDonald all the best in her continued work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2138</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Sense or Census</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the possible consequences of the 2011 Census contract being awarded to the US defence group, Lockheed Martin; notes that under the terms of the US Patriot Act which allows US law enforcement bodies to demand public information from private sector companies, detailed personal information on UK citizens could be handed over to US authorities and used for covert intelligence and surveillance work, and believes that assurances from the UK Government that provisions will be made to ensure that this does not happen, which have been dismissed by the Treasury Select Committee, could lead to many citizens boycotting the census or giving false evidence which in turn would render the census useless in terms of its objectives.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2137</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon:</strong> <strong>Living and Dying with Advanced Heart Failure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Living and dying with advanced heart failure: a palliative care approach</em>, by the Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care with the support of British Heart Foundation Scotland and the Scottish Government; notes that people with heart failure have a worse prognosis and poorer quality of life than many cancer patients and that 50% of advanced heart failure patients die within a year of diagnosis, many of them suddenly and unexpectedly; believes that uncertainty around prognosis should not be a barrier to people with advanced heart failure, or those with any other condition, receiving appropriate palliative care; is concerned that, despite the recommendations of the CHD and Stroke Task Force in 2001 that provision needed to be made for palliative care for advanced heart failure, too many of these vulnerable patients are still not getting the care they need at the time that they need it most, and urges the Scottish Government to ensure that its forthcoming palliative care strategy and the refreshed CHD and Stroke Strategy explicitly address the needs of patients with conditions other than cancer, like advanced heart failure, and take account of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2136</strong> <strong>Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell:</strong> <strong>Modern Studies Competition Winners - Brannock High School, Motherwell</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Martyn Nicol and Christopher Harrold, S4 students from Brannock High School in Motherwell, prize winners in a Modern Studies Educational Trust national competition that attracted entries from schools across Scotland, with their PowerPoint presentation on How Supporters Can Help Candidates in Election Campaigns; commends them for their combination of knowledge of their subject with sophisticated ITC skills, and congratulates the trust on this imaginative and user-friendly way of fostering an interest in politics among young people.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2135</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Poverty Challenge</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the failure of the UK Government&rsquo;s flagship policy of halving child poverty by 2010 and eliminating it by 2020 as figures released by the Office for National Statistics show that almost 4,000,000 children and 2,500,000 pensioners are living in poverty and that the numbers have risen for the second year in a row; notes that one of the reasons identified as being a contributory factor to the rise is the burden of council tax on pensioners which would be removed under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals to replace the council tax with a fairer form of local taxation, and believes that, given the huge scale of the problem, the inability of the UK Government to tackle this problem, and the pledge by all political parties in the Parliament to do everything that they can to end poverty, support for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policies aimed at tackling poverty should be given mature consideration, including the policy for an independent Scotland empowered to tackle these problems head on.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2134</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Unacceptable Levels of Poverty in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Office for National Statistics publication, <em>Scottish Households Below Average Income 2006-07</em>, which shows some 17% of households in Scotland and 21% of children are living in relative poverty, with 12% of children living in absolute poverty; believes that these figures are morally unacceptable and represent a failure of successive UK governments to take poverty in Scotland seriously, and further believes that the Parliament and Scottish Government need the normal powers of independence, including powers over the welfare and taxation system, in order to tackle poverty in Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2133</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Impact of Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the provisions of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 have resulted in increased costs of licences for small social and leisure clubs and organisations; recognises that a number of these small clubs and organisations are under threat due to the increases and may have to close their doors; is concerned about the detrimental impact that this will have on local community activity and life, and considers that this legislation is therefore having a negative impact in terms of encouraging positive pursuits and health lifestyles and should be reviewed at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2127</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>Welcome Scottish and Southern Energy to Cumbernauld</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Scottish and Southern Energy&rsquo;s agreement with Barclaycard to take over the Goldfish call centre in Cumbernauld; believes that the offer of 800 jobs following retraining is a excellent solution for Goldfish staff facing redundancy; hopes that any employees not offered positions will be given every assistance by the local authority and the Scottish Executive to find work; notes that the Goldfish call centre has been a major employer in Cumbernauld since Morgan Stanley originally opened in 1999 with 600 staff, and hopes members of the workforce in Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and surrounding area will enjoy a successful partnership with Scottish and Southern Energy.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2125</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>GM Crops Do Not Prevent World Hunger</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), the agricultural equivalent of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, for concluding that data on a range of genetically modified crops indicate highly variable yields, greater in some places and less in others; notes the reluctance of the IAASTD to rule out GM crops in future, but that it rightly concludes that if the multi-million pound investment by corporations in transgenic research and development had been applied to improving conventional methods of local food production and distribution then the current world food crisis would have been more successfully addressed; applauds the overwhelming conclusion of IAASTD that small-scale farming and ecological methods provide the way forward to avert the current world food crisis, and therefore welcomes the UK Government&rsquo;s approval of the IAASTD reports without reservation as confirmed in a written Commons statement by Douglas Alexander MP and encourages the Scottish and UK governments to mainstream the thrust of the IAASTD report in agricultural policy development.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2124</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Children&rsquo;s Climate Change Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the successful launch of the groundbreaking Children&rsquo;s Climate Change Project brought together by Children in Scotland, WWF Scotland and the Children&rsquo;s Parliament, with support from the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland and the Scottish Government; applauds all the children from across Scotland who have already been enthusiastic participants in the project residential session as they go back to their communities in the Western Isles, North Edinburgh, Fife and South Ayrshire to discuss their views on climate change with other children and adults, and looks forward to hearing their opinions on what Scotland should do about climate change when they present them at the Festival of Politics on Saturday 23 August 2008 and to their further contributions to the debate on the Scottish Climate Change Bill as it goes through Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2121.1.1</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Bus Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-2121.1) in the name of Alex Johnstone, insert at end &quot;notes that increasing fuel costs presents a significant opportunity for bus transport to demonstrate that it is an efficient and effective alternative for many car journeys, and condemns the failure of the Westminster government to respond to the sudden increases in the price of crude oil which are bringing uncertainty to a wide range of businesses and domestic users of oil and putting at risk the positive developments in the bus industry in recent years.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2121.3</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Bus Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2121) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;recognises that, in rural areas, buses are often the only alternative to car use and that rural areas therefore suffer disproportionately from bus fare increases or reduced bus services; considers that the review of the National Concessionary Travel Scheme should extend eligibility to older and disabled people using community transport in rural areas, and believes that the provision of efficient and affordable bus services must be supported with the necessary infrastructure on both local and trunk roads, including expanded park-and-ride schemes, bus passenger priority measures and accurate and accessible timetable information.&quot;</p>
