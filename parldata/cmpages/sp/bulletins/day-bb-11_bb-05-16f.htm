<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the end of this section the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">current motions</a> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A <a href="../../motionsandamendments/index.htm">search facility</a> is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any questions in relation to this section should be directed to the Chamber Desk, for which contact details are provided at the end of the Bulletin.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00018 Margaret Mitchell: Central FM</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Central FM on being named UK Local Radio Station of the Year at the Sony Radio Academy Awards 2011; acknowledges that Central FM received gold in the category for stations broadcasting to fewer than 300,000 adult listeners; notes that the judges described the radio station as vibrant and comprehensive and as having a real energy, and further notes that Central FM was commended for its relationship with its local community and that the station&rsquo;s presenters were praised for their ability to engage with listeners.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00017 Murdo Fraser: World Disabled Golf</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 2011 Scottish Pan-Disability Open Golf Championship, scheduled to take place at Dullatur and Westerwood golf courses from 11 to 18 July; thanks the organiser, Scottish Disability Golf Partnership (SDGP) for all its work in putting on the event, which will welcome over 50 golfers from across Scotland and abroad who will compete in the inaugural four-day, four-team Ryder Cup of disabled golf, with the four teams being Scotland, England, Celtic Nations and a World Squad; notes that this is Scotland&rsquo;s largest golf event ever arranged for disabled people and some of the top disabled golfers in the world will participate; recognises the important work of the SDGP, which is governed and operated by disabled people and actively encourages and involves anyone of any age with a disability, serious health problem or mobility issue and their coaches who wish to play golf; notes that SDGP membership includes amputees, blind people, deaf people, people with learning difficulties, people with Down&rsquo;s syndrome, people who have had a stroke or heart attack, wheelchair users and people with other similar issues who wish to learn or play the sport, and hopes that the open will be a great success.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00016&#9830; Mark McDonald: North Sea Taxation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of the UK Government to increase supplementary tax on North Sea oil production from 20% to 32%; notes that this decision was made without consultation with the industry and has led to uncertainty in the oil and gas sector; notes the decision by Statoil, immediately after the budget, to put on hold a $10 billion plan to develop the Mariner and Bressay fields and that other companies also have said that they are likely to reduce investment; further notes the report from Professor Alex Kemp of the University of Aberdeen, which shows that the tax rise could reduce UK oil and gas expenditure by up to &pound;50 billion, investment by up to &pound;30 billion and production by up to a quarter over the next three decades and the report from Oil and Gas UK that there has been a dramatic drop in confidence throughout the UK upstream oil and gas industry in the first quarter of 2011 in marked contrast to the highly positive business outlook recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010; believes that if the tax rise is fully implemented it will have a severe impact for future jobs and the economic prosperity of Aberdeen and the north east of Scotland, and welcomes the clear commitment by the First Minister to raise this matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00014 James Dornan: Concessionary Rents Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the decision by Glasgow City Council to cease its concessionary rents scheme and charge local charities full commercial rents for their properties; understands that the ending of the scheme will adversely affect many charities across Glasgow, including Glasgow the Caring City, based in the Castlemilk area of the Glasgow Cathcart constituency, which, it understands, helps thousands of children who live in Glasgow and also helps hundreds of thousands of children across the world deal with the effects of natural disasters and poverty; considers this proposal to be diametrically opposed to Glasgow&rsquo;s history and tradition of helping those most in need around the world, and calls on Glasgow City Council to reconsider its decision to scrap this policy and to allow Glasgow&rsquo;s charities to flourish, not flounder.</p>
<p><strong>S4M-00013 John Lamont: Borders Common Ridings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the cultural and historical importance of the various common ridings and festivals across the Scottish Borders, including those at Hawick, Jedburgh, Selkirk, Yetholm, Kelso, Duns and Coldstream; notes both the rich traditions of these events, dating back to the 16th century, and also their modern-day value in bringing communities together; congratulates this year&rsquo;s principals on their appointment, and wishes organisers and participants every success and enjoyment during the festivities of 2011.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00011 Bill Kidd: Unpaid Carers in Scotland Save &pound;10 Billion a Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report by Carers UK and the University of Leeds, <em>Valuing Carers 2011: Calculating the value of carers&rsquo; support</em>, and the finding that care provided by unpaid carers in Scotland is now worth a staggering &pound;10.3 billion each year and that one in eight people in Scotland care for ill or disabled loved ones, which would otherwise cost the state &pound;18 an hour, meaning that, for example, a carer caring for 35 hours a week saves on average more than &pound;32,000 a year; acknowledges the contribution that carers make, and considers that carers, and those for whom they care, should be more fully supported.</p>
