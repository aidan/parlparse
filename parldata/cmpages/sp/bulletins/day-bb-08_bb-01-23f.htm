<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1204</strong> <strong>Michael Russell:</strong> <strong>Scottish Biodiversity Strategy Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the collaborative work being undertaken by a wide variety of partners across the public, private and voluntary sectors to take forward implementation of the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy from 2004 to 2007, as set out in <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Biodiversity: It&rsquo;s In Your Hands &ndash; A Progress Report 2005-07</em>; commends the enthusiasm and commitment of all those involved in that work, and acknowledges that continued effort by all the partners engaged in conserving biodiversity in Scotland is required in order to address the challenges identified in the progress report such as climate change, invasive non-native species, river basin management, sustainable management of the natural world, the development of the ecosystems approach, wildlife crime and the need for the broader engagement of all citizens so that Scotland can play its part in delivering our national and international commitments to the cause of halting biodiversity loss.</p>
<p>Supported by: Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1203</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Reid Kerr</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the contribution that Reid Kerr College makes to education in Scotland, in particular to vocational training and lifelong learning; further notes the excellent facilities at Reid Kerr; congratulates the college on its exceptional HMIE report where it received a 100% clean sweep of the highest &quot;very good&quot; grade in the College Review section of the report &ndash; a first for any Scottish college; acknowledges the comments made by the Chairman of the Reid Kerr Board of Management who stated that &quot;Reid Kerr leads the sector in providing quality learning opportunities for all&quot;, and agrees with Principal Joe Mooney that &quot;The dedication, enthusiasm, team working and motivation of staff is reflected throughout the Report and the grades we achieved displays our commitment to continue to pursue excellence in everything we do&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1202&diams; </strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Alternative and Augmentative Communication</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern following the findings by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, Capability Scotland and Augmentative Communication in Practice whose recent survey of alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) equipment and speech and language therapy support provision in Scotland revealed that eight out of 15 NHS boards, including NHS Grampian, are providing a poor service; notes that only 16% of potential beneficiaries are accessing specialist AAC services in Scotland and that AAC provision is a postcode, age, advocacy and impairment lottery, and considers that an AAC strategy for Scotland should be developed and implemented to provide for a national standard of specialist speech and language therapy provision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1201</strong> <strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, reintroduced in the House of Commons on 7 November 2007, relating to investigation of bribery and corruption by foreign officers, violent offender orders and repatriation of prisoners, so far as these matters fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1200</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the principle of clauses in the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill, introduced in the House of Lords on 7 November 2007, providing for the collection and distribution of sums released from dormant bank and building society accounts for social and environmental purposes, and agrees that the provisions in the Bill that relate to the distribution of such sums in Scotland should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
<p>Supported by: John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1199</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005 (Modification) Order 2008 be approved.</p>
