          <p><strong>*S1M-3594</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Impact on Human 
            Rights Organisations of Proposed Israeli Legislation</strong>-That 
            the Parliament condemns the Bill tabled in the Israeli Parliament, 
            the Knesset, on 29 October 2002 by the chair of the Israeli Government 
            coalition, MK Zeev Boim, to secure impunity for war criminals, outlaw 
            human rights activities, imprison human rights activists for up to 
            ten years and destroy evidence of war crimes; notes that such a law, 
            if passed, would forbid "the holding of investigations and writing 
            down of results" and that any association engaging in any such activity 
            would be liable to be disbanded, effectively closing down any action 
            by human rights organisations to collect and then disseminate testimonies 
            of human rights violations; expresses grave concern that such proposals 
            would sabotage the work of Israeli human rights activists assisting 
            international war crimes tribunals at the Hague and make illegal the 
            courageous and conscientious actions of individual citizens of Israel, 
            and calls on MSPs to protest in the strongest terms to members of 
            the Knesset against these proposed violations of human rights.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3593#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: St Andrew's Day</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that the Scottish Executive and other appropriate 
            bodies should consider making St Andrew's Day a national holiday, 
            either by replacing one of the existing holidays in May or by making 
            it an additional holiday.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3592</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Comments by 
            Scottish Executive Chief Architect on Enric Miralles</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is indebted to the Scottish Executive Chief Architect 
            for revealing, as attributed to him in <em>The Herald</em> magazine 
            on 16 November 2002, that, in respect of Enric Miralles, &quot;We 
            did not employ an architect who was able to describe what he was doing 
            and show in traditional ways what he was building&quot; and &quot;He 
            quite deliberately didn't give you all the info&quot;; expresses regret 
            that the Chief Architect should have kept hidden until the day of 
            the decisive debate in the Parliament on the Holyrood Project the 
            true nature of Enric Miralles' illness which &quot;threatened the 
            future of the whole Parliament&quot;, and further regrets deeply that, 
            deprived of full information on Enric Miralles and an independent 
            medical assessment and prognosis, the Parliament was misled as to 
            his fitness to perform in accordance with his contractual obligations.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3591</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Comments by 
            Holyrood Project Director on the Parliament Building</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the opinion attributed in <em>The Herald</em> magazine 
            on 16 November 2002 to the Holyrood Project Director that &quot;negotiating&quot; 
            with the MSPs elected in May 1999 over a parliament building designed 
            to meet their requirements would have been likely to result in the 
            site for the new parliament still being undetermined in November 2002; 
            records its confidence in its ability to reach democratic decisions 
            on projects or policies which, constitutionally, are executed by officials 
            of either the Scottish Executive or the Parliament and which, in the 
            course of such a process, may be the subject of private, professional 
            exchanges between elected ministers and MSPs but should never be the 
            subject of public pronouncement on the part of officials whether in 
            relation to the credibility or value of the project or policy or the 
            abilities of those elected MSPs responsible for it, and questions 
            whether the Holyrood Project Director is a fit person to execute Parliament's 
            directives given her publicly expressed lack of trust in the collective 
            judgement of MSPs.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3590#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Delivery of Family 
            Planning Services in Dundee</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            with concern the changes being proposed to the delivery of family 
            planning services in Dundee; recognises the important work of well 
            woman clinics like the one in Whitfield which provides a range of 
            family planning and health screening services to women; is further 
            concerned that any closure of that clinic will require women to travel 
            by two buses to the other side of the city in order to access an alternative 
            clinic, and believes that such services are best provided within local 
            communities and that Tayside NHS board should urgently reconsider 
            these proposals. </a></p>
