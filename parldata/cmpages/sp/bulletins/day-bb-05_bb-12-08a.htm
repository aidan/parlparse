<blockquote>
  <p>The  Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3684.2 Shona Robison: Future Arrangements for Health Services in the Argyll and Clyde Area&mdash;</strong>As  an amendment to motion (S2M-3684) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from  first &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;regrets the failure of the Scottish  Executive to direct effectively the management of Argyll and Clyde NHS Board  prior to its reorganisation of December 2002 and the continuing lack of  direction and support that resulted in the Executive&rsquo;s decision to dissolve the  board two years and five months later in May 2005 and to redraw the boundaries  of the neighbouring boards to take over its responsibilities from April 2006; applauds  the continued successful efforts of staff in NHS Argyll and Clyde during these  difficult times to maintain comprehensive healthcare services for the people of  the area; demands clear evidence that input from the public consultation on the  boundary option to be adopted has been fully and objectively considered; supports  NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow in their task of returning services to  financial balance while maintaining high standards of quality and access, and  demands that the Executive provides these boards with adequate support and more  effective leadership and direction that will assist them to address credibly  the structural and financial problems in NHS Argyll and Clyde.&rdquo; </p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3684.4 Miss Annabel Goldie: Future Arrangements for Health Services in  the Argyll and Clyde Area&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3684)  in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from first &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to end and insert  &ldquo;applauds the efforts of all clinicians and staff in NHS Argyll and Clyde, at  this unsettling time, to maintain the delivery of services; expresses profound  concern about the inadequate nature of the consultation process concerning the  future of NHS Argyll and Clyde; believes that the consultation paper lacked  both a clear analysis of the structural and financial problems facing the  existing NHS board and any robust information about the implications of revised  NHS board areas for acute hospital services, which the public needs to make  informed choices about the options presented, and therefore calls for the  necessary analysis and information to be provided for the public as a matter of  urgency and for the consultation to be reopened, in order that informed  decisions can be made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3684.3 Frances Curran: Future Arrangements for Health Services in the Argyll and Clyde Area&mdash;</strong>As  an amendment to motion (S2M-3684) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from  first &ldquo;supports&rdquo; to end and insert &ldquo;believes that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s  decision to dissolve Argyll and Clyde NHS board was hasty and the subsequent  consultation document issued concerning the new boundary options for the services  provided by NHS Argyll and Clyde was completely inadequate, lacking both  financial information and possible impact assessment on service provision from  a reallocation of resources to NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow; further  believes that no-one responding to the consultation could reach an informed  view on these issues; therefore calls for this information to be placed in the  public domain before any decision, which could have a major impact on jobs and  services within the existing Argyll and Clyde NHS board area, is taken by the  Executive, and applauds the work of the existing staff to continue to provide  health care services within NHS Argyll and Clyde despite the enormous  uncertainty that they feel about their own employment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed  by</em> Parliamentary  Bureau Motions</p>
<p> <strong>S2M-3677 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Rule 9.5.3A&mdash;</strong>That the  Parliament agrees, for the purposes of consideration of the Joint Inspection of  Children&rsquo;s Services and Inspection of Social Work Services (Scotland) Bill at Stage 2, that  Rule 9.5.3A be suspended.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3678 Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: Business Motion&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament agrees that  consideration of the Joint Inspection of Children&rsquo;s Services and Inspection of  Social Work Services (Scotland)  Bill at Stage 2 be completed by 22 December 2005.</p>

<p> Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
<p> <strong>S2M-3243 Helen Eadie: Supporters  Hope that SFA will Admit John Thomson to Hall of Fame&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes  that football supporters across Scotland continue to honour the memory of John  Thomson, the young Celtic football player who so tragically lost his life in  1931; further notes that the people of Cardenden, in particular, and Scotland,  generally, have continued annually since his death to honour and pay tribute to  this legendary international football player who continues to serve as a role  model for Scotland&rsquo;s children as a person who was so decent, so upstanding and  so honoured for setting standards for behaviour in football of all that is  best, and hopes that the Scottish Football Association will admit John Thomson  to Scotland&rsquo;s Hall of Fame.</p>
