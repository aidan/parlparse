                                          <p><strong>S3M-6140 Jeremy Purvis: Supporting Business</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the crippling increases in non-domestic rates bills in Scotland, particularly in hospitality, tourism, auction mart and petrol station businesses; further notes the increases in the Scottish Budget resulting from the 2010 UK Budget, and calls on the Scottish Government to cap 2010-11 business rates increases at 12.5%, or 5% for small businesses, while allowing those who gain under the revaluation to see the benefits immediately. </p>
                                          <blockquote>
                                            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
                                            <p><strong>S3M-6140.1 John Swinney: Supporting Business</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6140) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from &quot;crippling&quot; to end and insert &quot;measuresthat the Scottish Government has put in place to support Scottish businesses as part of its economic recovery plan, including setting the lowest business rate poundage ever, saving businesses well over &pound;200 million in 2010-11 alone,and putting in place a package of relief measures worth around an additional &pound;2.4 billion over the nextfive years, including a new renewable relief scheme and extending the small business bonus scheme, which means that half of all businesses will receive a discounted bill this year and well over a quarter of businesses properties will pay no rates at all; recognises that the merits of a transitional relief scheme are outweighed by the disadvantages, and recognises that the measures that have been put in place, taken together, represent the most generous package of business rates support available in the United Kingdom.&quot; </p>
                                            <p> <strong>S3M-6140.2 Derek Brownlee: Supporting Business</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6140) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that some businesses have seen significant increases in their pre-appeal valuations as a result of revaluation and encourages those businesses to appeal their valuation where appropriate; welcomes the fact that the policy of the previous Scottish administration to levy a higher rate poundage than in England has been abandoned; welcomes the reductions in small business rates from 2008, delivered despite the opposition of some in the Parliament; does not believe that small businesses should see their rates bill increase to cross-subsidise the public sector or very large commercial organisations such as the major supermarkets; believes that any further reductions in business rate liabilities should be targeted by extending the small business rates relief and the rural rate relief scheme, and calls on the Scottish Government to assess the scope within the projected business rate income for this and future financial years to finance such an extension and to report to the Parliament the results of that assessment.&quot;</p>
