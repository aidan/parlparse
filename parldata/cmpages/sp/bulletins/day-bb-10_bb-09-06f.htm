<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6910 Cathy Jamieson: Land O&rsquo; Burns Brass Band Competition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Dalmellington Band on the continued success of its annual Land O&rsquo; Burns Brass Band competition; welcomes the competition&rsquo;s continued support from South Ayrshire Council, and congratulates Newmilns and Galston Band on winning the Co-op Trophy for the highest placed Ayrshire band.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6909 Robert Brown: Holyrood Secondary School Fair Trade Group</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Holyrood Secondary School in Glasgow on attaining the status of a fair trade school; notes that fair trade issues have been integrated into the curriculum throughout the school; believes that this has raised awareness of fair trade amongst staff, parents and pupils, with fair trade activities taking place throughout the year and culminating in the Fair Trade Week in September 2010; welcomes the work of the Holyrood Fair Trade Group, which began the Holyrood Malawi project in 2006, sending over 2,000 much needed school backpacks to children in Malawi, and has since funded several trips to the country to build and refurbish classrooms, and applauds all the pupils and teachers involved, particularly teacher Claire Wilson, on their achievements, and wishes them and the group the very best and continued success for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6908 Rob Gibson: Scotland&rsquo;s First Housing Expo</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament praises the delivery of Scotland&rsquo;s first Housing Expo, which attracted well over 30,000 visitors in August 2010 at Balvonie Braes, on the southern outskirts of Inverness; also applauds the organisers from Highland Council who it considers showed tenacity in the face of the economic recession and achieved a highly successful outcome with full backing from the Scottish Government; notes that 52 cutting-edge houses designed with the future in mind were seen to stimulate house buyers, architects and builders who now know that this climate change age demands house designs with as low carbon impact as possible; welcomes the support of experts from Finland for the achievements of the Scottish Housing Expo and notes that the inspiration from that Baltic Sea country has raised the standards of house design there in over 40 years of such events; calls on other local authority areas, architects and builders to join in planning the next Scottish Housing Expo to display the gold standard of house designs that needs to be available for affordable housing and private housing in future; is encouraged by the considerable number of enquiries by potential buyers of the private houses built on the site, and wishes all who live at Balvonie Braes including those allocated one of the 20 houses built by Albyn and Cairn Housing Associations for affordable rent and low cost ownership a comfortable, low carbon future.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6906# Bill Butler: Glas-goals Aiming High</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the <em>Evening Times&rsquo;</em> Glas-goals campaign and its three targets of encouraging Glaswegians to walk or run a million miles, stub out a million cigarettes and shed half a million pounds in weight between them over the next year; notes that the paper will work with partners including NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Glasgow Life, Glasgow City Council, Glasgow 2014 and Glasgow Housing Association to deliver a year-long series of events aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles; is alarmed that Glasgow, as it heads towards the 2014 Commonwealth Games, has one of the worst public health records in Europe with men in Glasgow having the lowest life expectancy in the United Kingdom, and with nearly a third of the city&rsquo;s population suffering from obesity and over 190,000 of its citizens still smoking; believes Glas-goals has the potential to make a significant contribution in addressing these deep-seated problems; encourages Glaswegians to join the campaign by participating in the Glas-goals events, which so far have included fun runs, cycle races, bunny hops and the World&rsquo;s largest tea dance, and encourages other local authorities and health bodies to consider using Glas-goals as a blueprint for campaigns across Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6897 Patrick Harvie: Buchanan Galleries Expansion Plans</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Buchanan Partnership Ltd not to pursue plans to construct a multistorey car park on top of Buchanan Bus Station; considers that such a development would have diminished the attractiveness of the space for bus users and limited future flexibility and development of bus services; agrees that, regarding the related plan to demolish the popular Glasgow Royal Concert Hall steps and replace them with a new commercial entranceway, there is an intrinsic value to public spaces in our towns and cities that are non-commercialised, where people can be citizens, not consumers, and in this spirit urges Buchanan Partnership Ltd to also reconsider its plan to scrap the steps.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6891 Liam McArthur: Ferry Duplicity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is of the view that, while the Scottish Government has been consulting on what is considered to be its damaging cost savings proposals for the lifeline ferry service to the Northern Isles, the government must have been planning the recently announced proposal to extend by one year its pilot of Road Equivalent Tariff fares on the ferries to the Western Isles, a pilot which has exclusively channelled funds to cut fares on the Western Isles routes while the users of the ferries to the Northern Isles, the Argyll islands and on the Clyde have enjoyed no such cuts; believes that to be simultaneously planning to extend this special treatment for the Western Isles while proposing to downgrade the services to the Northern Isles is at best duplicitous, and calls on the Scottish Government to end the threat to the Northern Isles by withdrawing its cost cutting proposals, proposals that would leave Orkney and Shetland with an inadequate service on what are vital lifeline routes.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-6888 John Farquhar Munro: Attack on Gugu Hunters of Ness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is of the view that the traditional harvest of gugas on Sula Sgeir by the men of Ness is under attack by the SSPCA; notes that the harvest is licensed by Scottish Natural Heritage, undertaken for human consumption and, it is considered, carried out at a level that does not threaten the gannet colony; believes that those calling for it to end are making an unwarranted attack on an old Hebridean tradition and should instead campaign against real threats to animal welfare of which there are, regrettably, a great number, and looks forward to the continued success of this age-old tradition that provides a delicacy that will continue to delight the palate of islanders at home and abroad for generations to come.</p>
