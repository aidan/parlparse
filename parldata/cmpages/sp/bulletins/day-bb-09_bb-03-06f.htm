<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3630</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Walk to the Rock</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the plans of the Dumbarton Football Club&rsquo;s Sons Supporters Trust to do a sponsored walk for charity on Saturday 25 April 2009; notes that the trust plans to walk from Loch Lomond shores to the Strathclyde Homes Stadium on the day of the home game against Forfar Athletic Football Club; welcomes the initiative shown by the trust in organising a family-friendly fundraising event that not only raises money for charity but promotes an active and healthy alternative to travelling to the game by car; further notes that the Sons Youth Development Initiative and St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospice, Renfrewshire, will benefit from the proceeds; congratulates everyone involved in the organisation of the event, and wishes them every success in their fund-raising on the day.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3629</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in paragraph 3(b)(iii) of Rule 9.12 of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3628</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Cost of Parliamentary Questions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, mindful of the answer to question S3W-17445 by the Minister for Parliamentary Business on 10 November 2008 that the cost of answering a parliamentary question is &pound;98.51, notes that at least one member has asked over 1,000 questions in this parliamentary session, costing a total of over &pound;100,000, and that if all members followed this example that the cost to the taxpayer would be nearly &pound;13 million, or &pound;26 million in a full session, and therefore requests all members to consider whether their question is really necessary before incurring yet more public expense.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3627</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Essential Scottish Opera</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Opera on its successful annual tour of opera morsels, Essential Scottish Opera; welcomes these efforts to bring live opera to venues across the country, including Bathgate, Girvan, Broughton, Lochgelly, Banchory, Birnam, Ballachulish, Isle of Mull, Ardfern, Isle of Skye, Gairloch, Calshmore, Sanday (Orkney), Strathpeffer and Boat of Garten; believes that this initiative provides an excellent opportunity for local communities across Scotland to enjoy opera in a relaxed and informal setting, while also ensuring that up-and-coming singers and musicians benefit from the chance to perform live in very intimate venues; notes that the performance in Sanday Community School has drawn favourable comparisons with the legendary school production of Oklahoma in 1981, and wishes Essential Scottish Opera success with future tours of this type.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3626&diams; </strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Credit Unions, Pioneering Roles in the Community</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the important role of credit unions within the Glasgow Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout Scotland; in particular, congratulates Pollok Credit Union on its unique and pioneering decision to set up an enterprise trust to take over the running of Pollok Post Office, manage a daycare nursery and offer a budgeting service to those with multiple debt problems, thereby securing jobs and services in the local community and beyond; recognises the real opportunity that these partnerships can provide in offering financial services and money advice to communities feeling the impact of economic recession, and considers that all possible ways by which further such enterprises can be encouraged should be explored.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3621</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Culture Minister Must Apologise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution to retract his derogatory remarks about parts of Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Stirling and Lanarkshire, made in his book,<em> In Waiting: Travels in the Shadow of Edwin Muir</em>, of October 1998; in particular calls on the minister to retract the comments that imply that Glasgow is too dangerous to get out of a car and that tenement closes are covered with the bodies of unconscious drug addicts, that describe the flag on Edinburgh Castle as &quot;an awful mutant tablecloth&quot;, that suggest that Dumfries is full of &quot;skinny, ill-dressed women&quot;, that Aberdeen is inhospitable and that Stirling is undesirable, and believes that it is against the interests of Scotland to have a minister who is responsible for promoting Scotland and its culture to be seen to continue to hold these views.</p>
