<STRONG>Mr Keith Harding: Breast Cancer Awareness</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
congratulates all the voluntary and research agencies involved for their efforts 
in highlighting Breast Cancer Awareness Month; recognises the importance of continuing 
research into the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, building upon major 
advances achieved over past decades; records its thanks to all the medical and 
ancillary staff involved for their unstinting kindness and support to patients 
and their families, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that 
funding is made available for increasing awareness, research, providing treatment 
and support and all other aspects of breast cancer care.</P><P>Supported by: Mrs 
Margaret Ewing<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Tommy Sheridan<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Margaret Smith<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3484</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Andrew Welsh: Angus Youth Congress</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates the Angus Youth Congress for its role in encouraging 
young people to become active citizens and, in so doing, play an active and constructive 
role in the democratic decision-making process; notes that a conference will take 
place on 11-13 October 2002 in which 70 delegates from Angus will meet in Dunoon 
to discuss the way forward for their organisation; looks forward to the outcome 
of the conference, and wishes the delegates every success in continuing to promote 
the voice of young people throughout the Angus Council area.</P><P>Supported by: 
Brian Adam<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3483</STRONG> <STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: 
Homeless Persons Unit, Glasgow City Council</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
supports the strike by 70 members of staff in the Homeless Persons Unit in the 
housing department of Glasgow City Council; appeals to the council to meet the 
union's demands; notes that the workers are taking indefinite strike action not 
on pay and conditions but in defence of the specialist service that they provide 
to the city's growing homeless population; is concerned by the council's policy 
of introducing generic workers in a whole series of departments, rather than using 
the specialist skills that staff have to the benefit of the public; recognises 
that the very specific skills required for working with homeless single persons, 
as distinct with homeless families, cannot be sustained under the council's restructuring, 
which indiscriminately groups all staff together in an unworkable fashion, and 
condemns the council's high-handed approach in advertising the workers' jobs in 
the press on the eve of the legally organised strike.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3482</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Elaine Smith: In-House Provision of Public Services</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament congratulates Lanarkshire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust on its decision 
to transfer the catering, portering and domestic staff at Monklands Hospital, 
formerly employed under Medirest&#146;s facilities management contract, back into 
the employment of the NHS Trust on 6 October 2002, a decision which was taken 
with a view to achieving improved patient care and best value; further congratulates 
UNISON on its &#145;Positively Public&#146; campaign, which includes support for 
the principle of having public services of the highest quality provided by an 
in-house team, and believes that the in-house model of public service provision 
should be extended right across Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3481#</STRONG> <STRONG>Bill 
Butler: Timetable for the Glasgow Airport Rail Link</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
<A NAME="MotionText">welcomes the response made by the Minister for Enterprise, 
Transport and Lifelong Learning in the debate on the future of air transport in 
Scotland to a question regarding the much-needed Glasgow Airport rail link; recognises 
that his reply, which talked of being able to come forward with &quot;the preferred 
option&#133;in the next few weeks&quot; and a &quot;starting date for design and 
construction&quot; of &quot;2005&quot; [<em>Official Report </em>c 14500], marks 
real progress on this matter; notes that the Minister&#146;s statement relates 
directly to an earlier members&#146; motion, S1M-3412, which urged the Minister 
to come forward &quot;as a matter of urgency&quot; with his &quot;favoured option 
for this development and a clear timetable for its speedy implementation&quot;, 
and stresses the absolute support of Glasgow&#146;s MSPs, Glasgow City Council, 
Strathclyde Passenger Transport and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce for the successful 
implementation of the &quot;ambitious timetable&quot; [<em>Official Report </em>c 
14500] announced on 9 October 2002 by the minister.</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3478
