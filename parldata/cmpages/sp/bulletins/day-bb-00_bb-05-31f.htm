    </font><font face="Arial"><p ALIGN="left"><strong><a name="922"></a>*S1M-922 Alex Johnstone on
    behalf of the Rural Affairs Committee: Borders Rail</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    recognises and endorses the case for the establishment of a railway linking the Scottish
    Borders to the national network at Edinburgh and Carlisle and urges the Scottish Executive
    to consult with the Strategic Rail Authority and others to facilitate its establishment. </p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><a name="921"></a><strong>*S1M-921</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: Tackling Rough
    Sleeping in Glasgow and Across Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the
    commitment of the Scottish Executive to achieving its aim that no one in Scotland should
    have to sleep rough by the end of this session of the Parliament; recognises the
    allocation of funds through the Rough Sleepers Initiative to projects which address the
    complex needs of rough sleepers including health needs, and notes the progress of the high
    level review team in carrying out a strategic review of current measures to tackle the
    problems of street homelessness in Glasgow and across Scotland.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-920</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: GM Crops</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    condemns the decision by Nick Brown, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to
    withhold vital information from the Scottish Parliament in relation to the importing of GM
    seeds; recognises that had the information been passed to the Scottish Executive
    immediately then farmers would have been able to avoid the sowing of GM contaminated
    crops, and calls upon Her Majesty&#146;s Government to finance an appropriate compensation
    package for Scotland&#146;s farmers and assume responsibility for any legal action against
    the seed-supplier Advanta Seeds.</p>

    McGugan<strong>*</strong></p><p ALIGN="left">
    <strong>*S1M-919#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing: Scottish Raptor Working Group</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament believes that the report of the Department of the Environment, Transport
    and the Regions&#146; Raptor Working Group does not reflect the particular circumstances
    and problems in Scotland; believes that there should be a Scottish Raptor Working Group
    established and that this should include within its membership representatives from all
    relevant organisations and bodies especially those whose livelihood depends upon the rural
    economy including representatives of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, the Scottish
    Landowners Federation, the Scottish Association for Country Sports, the British
    Association for Shooting and Conservation, the Scottish Homing Union and Scottish Natural
    Heritage; furthermore expresses its concern that growth in the population of certain
    raptors may have been at the expense of the population of pigeons, songbirds, grouse and
    other ground nesting birds and that certain groups espousing conservationist causes appear
    unwilling to accept that the protection of one bird species may result in the predation of
    others, and believes that the membership of any Scottish Raptor Working Group should not
    be dominated by such bodies professing a conservation objective. </p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-918</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Scottish Six O'clock News</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes with dissatisfaction the outcome of the review by the Governors of
    the BBC with regard to appropriate services to serve the devolved nations; expresses
    disquiet that once again the issue of the &quot;Scottish Six&quot; has not been adequately
    addressed despite support for such a programme from the Broadcasting Council for Scotland,
    the broadcasting trade unions, broadcasting staff and the majority of the Scottish
    broadcasting audience; deplores the establishment of yet another review to consider the
    matter, and calls upon the Board of Governors to respond to Scottish demand by authorising
    immediate editorial and technological preparations for the broadcast of a six o&#146;clock
    national and international television news programme to be in operation by the autumn of
    2000. <strong><i>R</i></strong></p><p ALIGN="left">
