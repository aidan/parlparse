<STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran: Closing the Opportunity Gap</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament welcomes the document <em>Closing the Opportunity Gap: Scottish Budget 
for 2003-06</em>, which shows how the Executive&#146;s spending plans, as set out 
in <em>Building a Better Scotland &#150; spending Proposals 2003-06: What the money 
buys</em>, will deliver a better life for the most disadvantaged people and communities 
in Scotland and agrees that the Executive&#146;s social justice spending plans

through investing in their homes and neighbourhoods.</P><P>Supported by: Hugh

<STRONG>*S1M-3474</STRONG> <STRONG>Fiona McLeod: European Health and Safety at 
Work Week, 14-20 October 2002</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the focus 
of this year&#146;s European Health and Safety at Work Week on the prevention 
of psychosocial risks and the stress that they cause, given that nearly one in 
three of Europe&#146;s workers report that they are affected by stress at work 
and that one in five workers in Scotland, an estimated half a million people, 
are exposed to work-related stress.</P><P>Supported by: Robin Harper<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3473#</STRONG> <STRONG>Fiona McLeod: Report by the United Nations 
Committee on the Rights of the Child</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
concluding observations by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on the 
UK&#146;s implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child published 
on 4 October 2002 and considers that the Scottish Executive should bring forward 
measures to address the criticism within its devolved areas of competence and 
use its influence with Her Majesty&#146;s Government in support of measures to 
alleviate distress to children in Scotland arising from reserved matters.</P><P>Supported 
by: Robin Harper<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3472</STRONG> <STRONG>Dorothy-Grace 
Elder: Use of the Holyrood Building as a Full Public Facility</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament believes that the new Parliament building should be a full public 
as well as parliamentary facility, giving priority to events held by diverse community 
groups, especially those unable to afford conference premises; considers that, 
as the building will have been custom-built for disabled access, it should be 
the premier meeting place in Scotland for those with disabilities as well as for 
community groups, including schools and theatre and performing arts clubs; further 
believes that it would be unacceptable for the building to be used only as the 
Parliament, especially in the light of cost rises, and that it should provide 
public facilities on every non-meeting day, including recesses, weekends and at 
night, and further considers that the cost of doing so would be minimal, given 
that security staff are present 365 days a year.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3471</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Malcolm Chisholm: The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic 
Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.12) (Scotland) Order 2002</STRONG>&#151;That

(Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.12) (Scotland) 
Order, recommends that the Order be approved.</P><P>Supported by: Mr Frank McAveety<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Mrs Mary Mulligan<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3470#</STRONG> <STRONG>Alex 
Neil: Census 2001: Depopulation</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">notes 
the latest Census 2001 figures which show that Scotland&#146;s population continues 
to fall; recognises that, unless depopulation is addressed now, there will be 
severe economic consequences, and believes that a Generation Taskforce should 
be established to assess what can be done now to solve this problem.</A></P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3469.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Future of Air Transport in Scotland</STRONG>&#151;As 
an amendment to motion (S1M-3469) in the name of Iain Gray, <A NAME="AmendmentText">leave 
out from &quot;consultation&quot; to end and insert &quot;urgent need, in relation 
to tourism and the economy in Scotland, to increase the limited number of direct 
international connections and to expand the number of routes operated by low-cost 
carriers; further notes that Inverness Airport is operated by Highlands and Islands 
Airport Limited, which is wholly owned by Scottish Ministers; is concerned at 
studies indicating that Inverness Airport has the highest landing charges in Europe, 
and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to set up a route development fund 
to promote direct international connections from Scotland and to take immediate 
action to reduce the landing charges imposed at Inverness Airport.&quot;</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3467
