<blockquote>
  <p>The  Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3585.1 Richard Lochhead: Waste Strategy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3585)  in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end &ldquo;notes that the key to a sustainable  waste strategy is a greater emphasis on reducing the level of waste produced;  recognises that to maintain public support and participation, waste collected  for recycling should not go to landfill; notes that municipal waste accounts  for only 25% of waste and that the other 75% comes from business and industry  and accurate information on the amount of such waste recycled is required;  notes concerns over the lack of accessible recycling infrastructure; calls for  waste management support for the small business sector, and recognises that,  for any waste strategy to be truly effective, Scottish ministers require the  necessary political powers to ensure they have all options available to them,  including measures relating to manufacturing, design and taxation.&rdquo; </p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3585.2 Alex Johnstone: Waste Strategy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3585)  in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from first &ldquo;welcomes&rdquo; to end and insert  &ldquo;believes that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policy on waste is failing and that the  amount of waste being sent to landfill is increasing, so that local authorities  will have to double their recycling performance in one year to meet the 2006  targets, and further believes that after six years the Executive needs to take  immediate steps to free up local authorities to enable them to deliver  innovative and appropriate solutions to suit their local circumstances.&rdquo; </p>
  <p><strong>S2M-3585.3 Shiona Baird: Waste Strategy&mdash;</strong>As an amendment to motion (S2M-3585)  in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from &ldquo;implementing&rdquo; to end and insert  &ldquo;improving Scottish recycling and composting rates but acknowledges that, in  spite of these improvements, Scotland still lags behind many of our European  partners and that the overall volume of waste being created continues to rise;  notes that there is a wide variation in recycling rates across Scottish local  authorities and strongly believes that access to comprehensive recycling  facilities should not be a postcode lottery; commends the efforts of the public  in rising to the challenge of recycling an increasing proportion of their waste  in spite of often poor facilities and lack of clear information; expresses  concern that many Scottish businesses and community groups engaged in recycling  have found their efforts thwarted by inappropriate levels of regulation and  heavy financial costs, and believes that a policy of zero waste, bringing  environmental, economic and social benefits, is the only truly sustainable way  to tackle Scotland&rsquo;s throwaway culture.&rdquo; </p>
