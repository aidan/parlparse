<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5473 Colin Fox: Welsh Assembly Abolishes Prescription Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the National Assembly for Wales for taking the decision this week to abolish completely NHS prescription charges for every patient in Wales from April 2007; agrees with the Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services, Dr Brian Gibbons AM, that the measure will reduce patient inequality and particularly benefit those patients with chronic illnesses or on low incomes and &quot;enable those people who need medication to get it to improve their health and ultimately their quality of life&quot;, and believes that Scotland should follow the terrific example set in Wales and also abolish the charges.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5472 Colin Fox: Prescription Charges Review</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that it is now exactly one year since the Stage 1 debate on the Abolition of NHS Prescription Charges (Scotland) Bill and since when the Scottish Executive promised to come forward with proposals to increase the list of long-term conditions exempt from payment; further notes that Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care, Lewis Macdonald MSP, has stated that he acknowledged that &quot;the current charge and exemption arrangements are no longer fit for purpose and that changes are necessary&quot; and that &quot;we will review the exemption arrangements for people with chronic conditions&quot; but that no changes have been brought forward by the Executive in a year despite giving repeated assurances in parliamentary answers that a decision was imminent; believes that no promised proposal has emerged because all medical experts have warned the Executive not to try to list the many different chronic conditions in an order of those that are more &quot;deserving&quot; or &quot;painful&quot;; considers that this is precisely what would be needed in order to distinguish between those conditions which are to be exempt from charges and which are not; notes that in 40 years medical opinion has veered away from such an approach because it was simply not possible on medical grounds to make such a judgement; believes that the Executive has failed to keep a promise it made to the Parliament and has dashed the hopes of thousands of chronically ill patients, and reiterates its belief that the fairest and most sensible way forward is to follow the example of the Welsh Assembly and abolish the &pound;6.75 prescription charge for every patient.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5471 Maureen Macmillan: Congratulations to Ross-shire Women&rsquo;s Aid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ross-shire Women&rsquo;s Aid on attaining 25 years&rsquo; service to women and children; notes that two Members of the Scottish Parliament, Maureen Macmillan and Rhona Brankin, were founder members of Ross-shire Women&rsquo;s Aid; welcomes the support that hundreds of women and children in Ross and Cromarty and the wider Highlands have received over those 25 years; wishes Ross-shire Women&rsquo;s Aid well in providing their services in the future, and welcomes the progress made in policy terms in respect of women&rsquo;s aid since the advent of the Parliament, allowing more women and children across Scotland to receive the help they need and deserve.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5470 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Recognise and Support One Plus</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of early years childcare and education; recognises the vital role played by One Plus in providing training, employment and care services across the west of Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to live up to its commitment to childcare and support to parents by providing the &pound;2 million funding required to retain the service to communities and save the jobs of over 600 people.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5469 Carolyn Leckie: Victory to the PCS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the resounding and determined vote of Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) members for strike action; considers that they have been dignified in the face of immense provocation by a government that is systematically dismantling public services, jobs, terms and conditions and decimating communities through the withdrawal of vital services to the most vulnerable groups in society; believes that PCS members should not be forced to resort to such action and that even at this late hour the government and employers should enter into meaningful negotiations concerning all of the many issues at the heart of this dispute and seek to reach agreement with the PCS on securing the future of jobs, public services and the communities that rely on them, and calls on all elected members to exert the strongest pressure on the Westminster Government and the Scottish Executive to deliver that end and stands in solidarity shoulder to shoulder with PCS members in their struggle.</p>
<p>Supported by: Rosie Kane*, Frances Curran*, Campbell Martin*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*</p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5468 Frances Curran: Free School Meals Work Wonders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the research from the University of Hull which praises the pioneering initiative of Hull City Council three years ago when it introduced free healthy school meals to all primary schools and notes that the research confirms that children are better behaved in class and are eating a higher quality of food at home as a result, the researchers say it has &quot;worked wonders&quot; and the city has the highest uptake of school meals in England yet, incredibly, the new Liberal Democrat council administration is considering scrapping the scheme which has the backing of the Westminster education secretary, Alan Johnson MP, who said, &quot;For the council to be considering scrapping the free school meals just as its success is being proved by this study is perverse&quot;.</p>
<p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Carolyn Leckie*, Robin Harper*, Colin Fox*</p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5467 Mr Tom McCabe: Statistics and Registration Service Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the provisions of the Statistics and Registration Service Bill, introduced in the House of Commons on 21 November 2006, which relate to statistics in Scotland and which are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or which confer functions on the Scottish Ministers, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
