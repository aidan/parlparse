          <p><strong>*S1M-4025</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: Glasgow Centre 
            for the Child and Society</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
            the establishment of the new Glasgow Centre for the Child and Society, 
            based at the University of Glasgow, which will work alongside government, 
            policy makers and non-governmental organisations to bring about significant 
            improvements in children&#146;s lives through work on children&#146;s 
            policy and services; commends the work to be done there on research, 
            teaching, consultancy and policy advice in the areas of child welfare 
            and child protection, children&#146;s rights and young people and 
            crime and welcomes the contribution the centre will make to effecting 
            positive changes in the lives of children and young people in Scotland, 
            including the improvement of the lives of our most vulnerable children 
            and young people, and to making sure that children&#146;s experiences 
            and perspectives are properly included in decision-making.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4024</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: Mental Health 
            (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That the Parliament

            the principle of introducing alcohol and drug testing for mariners 
            as set out in the Railways and Transport Safety Bill and agrees that 
            the relevant provisions in the bill on these issues that relate to 
            devolved matters should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4022</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Sexual Offences 
            Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&#151;That the Parliament endorses the 
            principle of protecting society from persons who pose a risk of causing 
            sexual harm and agrees that the provisions within the Sexual Offences 
            Bill that relate to devolved matters and which re-enact the Sex Offenders 
            Act 1997, extend the categories of offenders required to register, 
            increase restrictions on sex offenders and strengthen the notification 
            requirements and operation of the Sex Offenders&#146; Register should 
            be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4021#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Relocation of 
            European Maritime Safety Agency to Glasgow</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament notes that the European Maritime Safety Agency is due to 
            relocate from Brussels to elsewhere in the European Union; notes the 
            long-standing and rich sea-going heritage and ongoing business interests 
            of both Glasgow and Scotland in the maritime sector, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive and all relevant bodies should take all 
            possible steps to have the agency located in Glasgow.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4020</strong> <strong>Elaine Thomson: Great Northern 
            Partnership and Social Inclusion Partnerships</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament commends the work done by the Great Northern Partnership 
            (GNP) in Aberdeen; notes that the GNP plays an important role in improving 
            quality of life and extending opportunities for those living there, 
            especially the community of Middlefield, and further commends social 
            inclusion partnerships across Scotland for empowering local communities.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4018</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: National Galleries 
            of Scotland Bill - Final Stage</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees 
            that the National Galleries of Scotland Bill be passed.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4017#</strong> <strong>Iain Smith: Proposed Closure of 
            Civic Amenity Sites in Fife</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the proposed closure of community civic amenity sites 
            in Fife; further notes that these closures are caused by requirements 
            being imposed by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) 
            which require that all such sites should be permanently staffed; believes 
            that this will result in the loss of valuable community facilities 
            across Scotland, particularly at weekends and evenings, which will 
            result in increased fly-tipping and greater risks to the environment, 
            and further believes that SEPA should cease imposing these requirements 
            with immediate effect.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4016#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler: Announcement of Glasgow 
            Airport Rail Link Project</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes 
            the announcement made on 12 March 2003 by the Minister for Enterprise, 
            Transport and Lifelong Learning committing the Scottish Executive 
            to invest in the construction of the vital Glasgow Airport rail link 
            to Central Station; applauds the timetable for implementation of the 
            project which could begin as early as 2005 with a completion date 
            of 2008 and recognises that this will result in Glasgow being the 
            first city in Scotland to have a completed direct airport rail link; 
            notes that the new airport rail link will provide Glasgow with a direct 
            connection to three international airports and believes that this 
            will contribute in a positive fashion to the economic development 
            of Glasgow and west central Scotland; accepts that this announcement 
            does not preclude the Glasgow crossrail project from being developed 
            in due course, and praises the commitment of Glasgow&#146;s MSPs, 
            Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Passenger Transport, Glasgow Chamber 
            of Commerce and <em>The Evening Times</em> in campaigning, and arguing, 
            for this much-needed transport project.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Janis Hughes</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4016.1</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Announcement 
            of Glasgow Airport Rail Link Project</strong>&#151;As an amendment 
            to motion (S1M-4016) in the name of Bill Butler, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;, whilst welcoming at long last a commitment 
            to building the long-awaited Glasgow Airport direct rail link announced 
            by the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning on 
            12 March 2003, regrets that the minister has chosen the cheapest option 
            for the rail link and that there is no commitment to the Glasgow CrossRail 
            scheme, which would connect Glasgow Airport to the entire country 
            and has long been identified as a key component to the success of 
            the Glasgow Airport rail link and crucial to the transport infrastructure, 
            economic development and regeneration of Glasgow and the west of Scotland; 
            notes that travellers from the north and east heading to Glasgow Airport 
            will still have to make their way from Glasgow Queen Street to Glasgow 
            Central Station to connect; believes that the lack of commitment to 
            CrossRail demonstrates a lack of understanding of the needs of passengers, 
            and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should make, at 
            the earliest possible time, a commitment to the development of the 
            Glasgow CrossRail scheme.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4015#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Welcome Overhaul 
            of Credit Laws</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the decision 
            of the Department of Trade and Industry to introduce legislation that 
            will, at long last, give greater protection against those avaricious 
            companies that inflict extortionate interest charges upon vulnerable 
            borrowers; believes that the Scottish Executive, Scottish banks, credit 
            unions and local authorities have an important role to play in the 
            proposed safeguards to be given to decent, ordinary people who are 
            hoodwinked by such disreputable companies, and further believes that 
            ways and means must be found to eliminate the predatory activities 
            of loan sharks who continue to ply their evil trade in communities 
            throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Janis Hughes</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4013</strong> <strong>Mr John McAllion: Emergency Debate 
            on Outbreak of War with Iraq</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes 
            that the outbreak of any war with Iraq, which seems imminent, requires 
            an emergency debate in the Parliament and calls on the Presiding Officer 
            to schedule such a debate as soon as any war breaks out, up to and 
            including Monday 31 March 2003.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan, Dorothy-Grace Elder, Donald Gorrie, 
            Margo MacDonald, Robin Harper, Brian Adam, Dennis Canavan, Mr Adam 
            Ingram, Mr Lloyd Quinan, Mr Gil Paterson, Elaine Smith, Michael Russell</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-4006</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: South Lanarkshire 
            Secondary Schools PPP Proposal</strong>&#151;That the Parliament shares 
            the concerns of parents and pupils in East Kilbride with regard to 
            South Lanarkshire Council&#146;s public private partnership proposal 
            for secondary schools which, if implemented, will lead to 75% of resultant 
            school closures being in East Kilbride, where 50% of secondary schools 
            will be lost resulting in school rolls amongst the highest in Scotland 
            and to considerably longer school journey times for pupils owing to 
            the locations of the proposed schools; notes that the council&#146;s 
            financial proposal is underpinned by the closure of St Bride&#146;s 
            High School, academically the highest-performing school in South Lanarkshire, 
            in order that its site can be sold for development; recognises the 
            further concern of parents in East Kilbride that the consultation 
            process by South Lanarkshire Council is inadequate, and calls on the 
            council and the Minister for Finance and Public Services, in consideration 
            of the local community&#146;s deep-felt anxiety on this issue, to 
            reconsider this deeply flawed proposal.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-4005</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: William Symington 
            and the Charlotte Dundas</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            that 28 March 2003 marks the bicentenary of the birth of steam transport; 
            further recognises that this is the anniversary of an event that took 
            place in Scotland; notes that, on 28 March 1803, the voyage of William 
            Symington&#146;s steam tug <em>Charlotte Dundas</em>, towing the sloops 
            <em>Active</em> and <em>Euphemia</em> on the Forth and Clyde Canal 
            from Castlecary to Port Dundas in Glasgow, was an event of immense 
            significance for the world; is aware that the anniversary of the birth 
            of steam transport in the United States of America, which took place 
            more than four years later, is already being prepared for and will 
            be celebrated in major style; considers that the completion of the 
            three-quarters model of the <em>Charlotte Dundas</em>, parts of which 
            are in Falkirk museum, would be a useful and positive start to commemorating 
            both William Symington and the bicentenary, greatly complement the 
            modern engineering achievement that is the Millennium Wheel at Falkirk 
            and enhance and promote Scotland as a place of engineering excellence 
            and the cradle of the industrial revolution, and, therefore, given 
            the Scottish Executive's support for publicly commemorating other 
            historic anniversaries, calls on the First Minister to respond speedily 
            and positively to the letter on this matter that was sent to him by, 
            amongst others, Professor Christopher Smout, Professor Tom Devine,

            from &quot;the greatest&quot; to end and insert "whose literary contribution 
            to world culture was immense; further notes the immense contribution 
            of other great writers from these islands who are almost too numerous 
            to mention but who, in terms of international significance, must include 
            Robert Burns, Walter Scott, Oscar Wilde, Seamus Heaney, W B Yeats, 
            Dylan Thomas, Thomas Hardy, Charles Dickens and a vast number of others 
            living and dead; celebrates all those who wrote, and continue to write, 
            in the different languages of these islands and in many different 
            genres; particularly remembers Sorley MacLean, one of the great European 
            poets of the 20th century, who wrote in Gaelic, and Hugh MacDairmid, 
            who wrote in Scots as well as in English; welcomes the contribution 
            that World Book Day makes to an understanding of the importance of 
            literature to our cultures and the way in which it can foster an appreciation 
            of other perspectives on our world and thereby develop an international 
            outlook in children as well as in adults; congratulates those modern 
            Scottish, English, Welsh and Irish writers who were mentioned in the 
            various shortlists compiled for World Book Day and, in particular, 
            Matthew Fitt, whose ground-breaking novel in Scots featured on the 
            BBC Radio 4 shortlist and Des Dillon, whose novel <em>Me and Ma Gal</em> 
            was voted the book that said most about Scotland in the actual World 
            Book Day poll, and encourages all those involved in politics, education 
            and culture in Scotland to maintain and develop a generous and wide-ranging 
            view of literature and resist any narrow, ill-informed and ideological

            creativity.&quot; </a> </p>

            Law</strong>&#151;That the Parliament shares the Scottish Executive's 
            commitment to progressing the reform of charity law; recognises that 
            this will assist in developing the contribution of charities to their 
            communities; notes the voluntary sector's call for a charities bill, 
            and welcomes the Executive's commitment to keep the need for such 
            legislation under review.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3897#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Suicide Emergency 
            Telephone Hotline</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern 
            that in 2000 there were 880 reported suicides in Scotland, 676 males 
            and 204 females, although the true figure could be higher; is conscious 
            that many thousands of other people attempt to take their own lives 
            each year; regrets that only a minority of the population know the 
            telephone number of the Samaritans or any other organisation they 
            could contact for help when feeling suicidal; believes that, to assist 
            in achieving the goal of a 20% reduction in the incidence of suicide 
            by 2013 set by the Scottish Executive in its <em>National Strategy 
            and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide in Scotland</em>, everyone should 
            be made aware of an all-Scotland telephone number to call for help; 
            acknowledges that in the United States anyone can call a nationwide 
            toll free number from anywhere in the country, 1-800-SUICIDE or 911, 
            to ask for help which is provided swiftly if they say they are in 
            &#145;suicidal danger&#146;; believes that the Scottish Executive 
            should set up a suicide prevention crisis hotline, whereby calls from 
            suicidal individuals are treated as an emergency, through using the 
            existing 999 emergency number from which they can be referred directly 
            to a dedicated suicide prevention 24 hour hotline, and further acknowledges 
            that the purpose of this line would be to save lives through dissuading 
            suicidal people from killing themselves and that the Executive should, 
            once such a line was established, take steps to let the public know 
            about it.</p>
