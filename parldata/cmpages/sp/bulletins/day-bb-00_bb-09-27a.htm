                        further growth in this sector; notes the Executive’s wish 
                        to ensure that the creative and business skills on which 
                        these industries depend are fully and properly nurtured 
                        in Scotland’s people; welcomes Scottish Enterprise’s £25 
                        million development strategy to support this sector of 
                        the economy and promote its continuing expansion; and 
                        therefore endorses the determination of the Executive 
                        to ensure the conditions in which Scotland’s creative 
                        industries will continue to flourish in rapidly growing 
                        world markets. </font></p>
