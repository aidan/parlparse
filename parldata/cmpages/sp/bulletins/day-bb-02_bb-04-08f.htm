          <p><strong>*S1M-2968</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Aggregates Tax Sustainability 
            Fund</strong>-That the Parliament recommends that the Scottish Executive 
            establish a sustainability fund in order to distribute revenues from 
            the aggregates tax similar to that planned by Her Majesty's Government 
            in England and Wales and that the Scottish Landfill Tax Credit Forum 
            is consulted on the details of the administration of the fund. </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2967</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Fire Safety at 
            Glasgow Royal Infirmary</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 
            £250,000 installation of hi-tech fire alarms at Glasgow Royal Infirmary 
            as the final stage of an overall upgrade to increase safety for staff, 
            patients and the public in every ward and building.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="2966"></a>*S1M-2966#</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith: 
            World Asthma Day, 7 May 2002</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 
            World Asthma Day is on Tuesday 7 May 2002 when, in the United Kingdom, 
            the National Asthma Campaign will highlight childhood asthma; is aware 
            that over 113,000 (around 1 in 6) children in Scotland have been diagnosed 
            with asthma and that the incidence is highest amongst children; commends 
            the National Asthma Campaign Scotland for its work on childhood asthma, 
            including its publication of the first childhood asthma audit and 
            its programme of asthma information sessions for adults working in 
            the early years sector; further notes the soon to be published Scottish 
            Intercollegiate Guidelines Network/British Thoracic Society guidelines 
            for asthma and invites the Scottish Executive to devise a national 
            asthma strategy to ensure that these guidelines are implemented across 
            the country and matched by any necessary resources.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2965</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: River Kelvin 
            Walkway</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the £750,000 upgrade 
            to the three-mile River Kelvin walkway planned by Glasgow City Council; 
            notes that this walkway is very popular with walkers, cyclists, joggers 
            and families and provides a quiet and safe route for many people who 
            wish to avoid busy city roads; further notes that it is also home 
            to a wide variety of wildlife and native plants and believes that 
            the beauty of the river walk will only be enhanced by the resurfacing 
            of the path.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2964</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Refurbishment 
            of Glasgow City Halls</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow 
            City Council on its £950,000 allocation from the Scottish Arts Council 
            towards a major refurbishment of the City Halls; notes that the refurbishment 
            of this major venue in the city centre will improve the already outstanding 
            acoustics in the 1,000 seater Grand Hall Auditorium thereby making 
            the venue fully equipped for digital radio and television broadcasting, 
            webcasting and interactive teaching and learning, as well as creating 
            enhanced facilities for performers and audiences, and supports the 
            creation of a home at the City Halls for the BBC Scottish Symphony 
            Orchestra and the Scottish Music Information Centre.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2963#</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield: In-patient 
            Paediatric Services at Monklands District Hospital</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes with concern the decision by Lanarkshire Primary 
            Care NHS Trust to renege on its commitment to re-establish in-patient 
            paediatric services within Monklands District Hospital; believes that 
            the Trust should fulfil this commitment and return these services 
            to the hospital as soon as possible and invites the Scottish Executive 
            to make urgent representations to the Trust to ensure that the views 
            of the people of Monklands are fully considered before any final decision 
            is made regarding the future of these services.</p>
