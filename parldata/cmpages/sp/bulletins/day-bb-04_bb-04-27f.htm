          <p><strong>*S2M-1207</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to the Solway Sharks</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Dumfries 
            and Galloway's ice hockey team, the Solway Sharks, on its victory 
            in winning the 2004 Scottish Ice Hockey Association's Scottish Cup 
            final.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1206#</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Harestanes 
            Wind Farm Planning Application</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern Scottish Power's planning application to erect 94 wind 
            turbines, each 411 feet high, in the Forest of Ae in Dumfries and 
            Galloway; further notes that this is one of several industrial-scale 
            wind farm planning applications in the region, and believes that a 
            public inquiry should be held in advance of the determination of this 
            application by Scottish Ministers.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1205</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Identity 
            Cards</strong>-That the Parliament is opposed to the introduction 
            of identity cards as a clear attack on the civil liberties of our 
            citizens; pledges that MSPs will not use identity cards in the event 
            of them becoming compulsory, and calls on the people of Scotland to 
            join in a campaign of defiance by refusing to use identity cards.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1204</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Newton 
            Dee Village Community</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the 
            huge investment in, and the excellent and unique work accomplished 
            at, the Newton Dee Village Community since 1940 and also at the 11 
            other centres of the Camphill Village Trust through the provision 
            of fulfilling work opportunities and homes for adults with learning 
            disabilities; commends the pioneering health care provision available 
            to residents and the local community; recognises the impact this has 
            on the development of wide-ranging interests and participation in 
            cultural and social activities, and believes that everything possible 
            should be done to allow the community to continue undisturbed and 
            to develop over future years.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1203</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Foster 
            Care Fortnight</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the annual Foster 
            Care Fortnight organised by the Fostering Network that is to take 
            place between 10 and 24 May 2004; further welcomes the excellent work 
            undertaken by the Fostering Network in supporting fostering within 
            Scotland; notes with concern the shortfall of 650 foster carers across 
            Scotland and the report <em>Progress with Complexity </em>by Angus 
            Skinner, Chief Social Work Inspector, which gives a headline figure 
            of 367 children and young people still awaiting a placement; notes 
            also the figure of 20 to 50% of all children in foster care being 
            required to move three or more times in inappropriate placements to 
            the detriment of their educational and emotional well-being; further 
            notes the calls for a uniform minimum allowance scheme across Scotland 
            to provide significant help in boosting the recruitment and retention 
            of foster carers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that 
            local authorities are in a position to pay the Fostering Network's 
            minimum recommended allowances, recognised by the Inland Revenue as 
            the basis for new tax exemptions introduced in 2003, as the first 
            step in introducing a nationwide &quot;Payment for Skills&quot; scheme.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1202</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Civil 
            Partnership Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament endorses 
            the principle of giving same sex couples in Scotland the opportunity 
            to form a civil partnership and agrees that the provisions in the 
            Civil Partnership Bill that relate to devolved matters should be based 
            on Scots law and considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1201#</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Television</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Thistle Television, 
            the only local television station in Scotland, on commencing local 
            television broadcasting throughout Lanarkshire with a potential audience 
            of 400,000 local people; welcomes Thistle Television as a valuable 
            addition to local media networks and creative employment, and looks 
            forward to its contribution to local business, culture, education, 
            and community involvement.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1200</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>10th 
            Anniversary of Democracy in South Africa</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates the South African people and government on the 10th 
            anniversary of a democratic South Africa; notes that, despite the 
            threats and predictions of some, South Africa's transition from apartheid 
            to democracy was achieved with a minimum of bloodshed; believes that 
            this owes much to the political maturity and leadership of the liberation 
            movement and the strength, understanding and patience of the people; 
            further believes that the rainbow nation has become a beacon against 
            racism for the world; specifically congratulates the South African 
            people and government on considerable achievements since the overthrow 
            of apartheid, including (a) water - during 2004 the 10 millionth connection 
            to clean water over the past decade will be made, (b) sanitation - 
            in 1994 some 22 million people had no access to clean water, today 
            it is down to 18 million, (c) housing - 1.6 million new houses built 
            since 1994, (d) electricity - in 1994 some 60% of South Africa's population 
            had no access to electricity, now more than 70% have access and (e) 
            education - in 1994 a divisive education system provided secondary 
            education for 70%, now an integrated system covers 85%; acknowledges 
            the terrible legacy of colonialism and apartheid which remains a huge 
            challenge; shares the grave concern over the HIV/AIDs pandemic and 
            the huge cost in suffering to the people of South Africa; pledges 
            continuing solidarity in the struggle to overcome the legacy of colonialism 
            and apartheid, especially given Britain's responsibilities; congratulates 
            ACTSA Scotland (Action for Southern Africa, the successor to the Anti-Apartheid 
            Movement) for the part it played in the South African people's liberation 
            from apartheid and its continuing role to develop links and facilitate 
            solidarity with the people of South Africa; welcomes the joint activity 
            by Scottish and South African organisations, including local authorities, 
            trade unions, students and churches, to build mutually beneficial 
            contacts and activities in various spheres, including those of economic, 
            cultural, educational and sporting activity, and considers that MSPs, 
            the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Ministers should assist in the 
            facilitation of these links with the people and government of South 
            Africa.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1199</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of the Queen Mother's Hospital</strong>-That the Parliament regrets 
            Greater Glasgow NHS Board's decision of 20 April 2004 to close the 
            Queen Mother's Hospital in Glasgow; notes that the Queen Mother's 
            Hospital is an integral part of the Yorkhill campus model of care, 
            deliberately co-locating specialist maternity and paediatric care 
            and attracting world class medical and surgical expertise; further 
            notes the proven record of excellence at Yorkhill in the development 
            of ultrasound, innovative foetal therapy and developing a breast milk 
            bank; believes that this service model has benefited women with difficulties 
            in their pregnancies, sick babies and families throughout Scotland 
            as well as providing an important general maternity service for the 
            north west Glasgow corridor and that the hospital has been the hospital 
            of choice for many more women in the west of Scotland for over 40 
            years; believes that the quality of specialist baby and maternal care 
            services is threatened by this decision as reconfiguration may prove 
            costly and difficult to implement; is concerned that the board has 
            taken this decision in the face of overwhelming clinical, political 
            and public opposition; believes that the decision was reached unfairly 
            using inaccurate assumptions and that no other option was seriously 
            considered, and considers that the Minister for Health and Community 
            Care must (a) take steps to restore public confidence in consultation 
            and decision-making processes in the NHS, (b) thoroughly review all 
            of the factors that led to the Greater Glasgow NHS Board's decision 
            on maternity services, (c) reject the decision to close the Queen 
            Mother's hospital and (d) ensure that the integrated specialist care 
            model is protected to continue to serve Scotland with the same quality 
            of service and innovation that has been achieved over the last 40 
            years.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1198</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Queen 
            Anne High School and Fife Miners' Banner</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates the students and staff on the Art and Design department 
            of Queen Anne High School, Dunfermline, for their winning design for 
            a new banner to commemorate the Fife Miners' Gala in recognition of 
            Anne Picking MP's former role as the National President of UNISON 
            in 1999-2000.<strong><em> R</em></strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1197#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>1911 
            and 1921 Census Records</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that 
            the Census records for 1841 to 1891 were released after less than 
            82 years of closure and commends this practice; regrets the introduction 
            of a 100-year rule in 1974, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
            should review the position for the 1911 and 1921 Census records to 
            allow greater access for those who wish to pursue their family history.</P>
