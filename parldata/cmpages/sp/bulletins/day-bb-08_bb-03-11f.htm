<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1535&diams; </strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Medtech</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the contribution of the medical technology (medtech) sector to Scotland which is worth around &pound;8.7 million and accounts for around 7,000 jobs; notes that the medical devices sector has been identified as one of the six key technology areas for the following five years by the Council for Science and Technology and that the market is worth $200 billion globally; welcomes the work of Lanarkshire-based Medical Devices in Scotland (MDIS) in providing advice and support for medtech businesses with issues such as regulation, procurement, trade shows and product development, as well as facilitating research and development projects worth over &pound;8 million; further welcomes the fact that MDIS has generated an approximate nine-fold return on an investment of &pound;949,064 provided by Scottish Enterprise since 2001; is therefore concerned that Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s funding for MDIS is due to cease as of 31 March 2008; considers that this may lead to a weakening of the sector&rsquo;s position in Scotland at a time when other UK regions and the Republic of Ireland are aggressively targeting the sector, and therefore considers that all interested parties should work together to provide a solution guaranteeing the long-term financial support that the sector requires.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1534</strong> <strong>Joe FitzPatrick:</strong> <strong>Contribution of Pharma-Related Business Activity to the Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent report for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Scotland by economics consultancy, EPA, which shows that pharma-related businesses contribute &pound;860 million each year to the Scottish economy, are responsible for nearly &pound;490 million in spending on goods and services, directly employ 8,000 people in Scotland and support 12,800 jobs; recognises that the sector plays a key role in the nation&rsquo;s economy; commends the efforts of those who seek to win new investment for  the sector in Scotland; recognises the need to attract talented individuals from home and abroad to pharma-related businesses, and considers that the Scottish Government should provide appropriate support for pharma-related businesses, their people and products.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1533</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Sanday Community School Wins Best Animation Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Sanday Community School on its success in winning the prize for Best Animation at the First Light Movies Awards 2008, with their production &quot;Lights Out!&quot;, a short animated film following a group of seals&rsquo; quest to switch off the light of Start Point Lighthouse in Sanday; notes that the film was chosen by a panel of expert judges, including actors Kevin Spacey, Orlando Bloom, Alan Rickman and Stephen Fry, producer Nira Park and directors Sam Mendes, Gurinder Chadha and Michael Winterbottom, and believes that the school&rsquo;s success is the result of the hard work of the school&rsquo;s talented pupils and of the excellent leadership of its staff.</p>
<p>Supported by: Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong>, Jamie McGrigor<strong>*</strong>, Alasdair Allan<strong>*</strong>, Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Joe FitzPatrick<strong>*</strong>, Patricia Ferguson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1532</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Glencraft Aberdeen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the continued financial difficulties of Aberdeen&rsquo;s Glencraft and other Scottish workplaces specifically for blind and other disabled employees; calls on these five companies to consider amalgamation to form one viable, national company, as seen in a model English group called PLUSS; recognises the need for places of sheltered employment, and calls on the UK and Scottish governments and local authorities to work with the sheltered employment groups to find a viable solution.</p>
