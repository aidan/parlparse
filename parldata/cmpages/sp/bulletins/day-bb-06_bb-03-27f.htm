<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4177</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Health and Safety at Work</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concerns of Aberdeen City Council that there is a need for greater engagement by the Parliament in issues relating to health and safety in Scotland; notes that, while health and safety legislation and its enforcement are reserved to Westminster, the Scottish Executive has a role in the promotion of health and safety, and urges the Parliament and Executive to explore ways in which a forum can be established for the discussion of ongoing issues relating to health and safety in the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4176</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Fairtrade NUS</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the National Union of Students Services Limited (NUSSL), the buying consortium for NUS-affiliated students&rsquo; unions, on its decision to become 100% Fairtrade for hot beverages, subject to approval at the forthcoming NUSSL Annual General Meeting; supports moves by the NUS to encourage its entire membership to opt in to Fairtrade status; recognises that Edinburgh University Students&rsquo; Association, along with others, has submitted a motion to NUS Annual Conference supporting this move; notes that the motion will allow the NUS to encourage all student unions to embrace Fairtrade and ensure that the millions of students across the United Kingdom will drink Fairtrade as default in their unions; further recognises the importance of Fairtrade products for securing a fair deal for farmers in developing countries, and calls on the UK Government to continue to do all it can to support the continued growth of the fair trade market in the United Kingdom.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4175</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Anti-Trades Union Practices at Asda Wal-Mart</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the anti-trades union practices of Asda Wal-Mart which has been fined &pound;850,000 for offering employees a pay rise to give up union rights at a distribution depot; congratulates GMB Scotland on the success of its campaign on the legal right to maintain union recognition which is fundamental to our society; expresses concern over the attempt of Asda Wal-Mart&rsquo;s public relations company to discredit the GMB, and reiterates that modern, growing trades unions are an important, indeed vital, part of both Scottish society and the viability and future success of Scotland&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4174</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The Draft Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (Commencement No. 2 and Consequential Provisions) (Scotland) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Communities Committee recommends that the draft Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (Commencement No. 2 and Consequential Provisions) (Scotland) Order 2006 be approved.</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S2M-4173</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Whisky Duty on Ice</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the Budget announcement by Gordon Brown MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer, that duty on whisky and other spirits will be frozen yet again; considers this to be a progressive move which helps support the industry&rsquo;s competitiveness and productivity; notes that a fairer alcohol duty regime helps support a key British industry in its home market and sends a message of tax fairness overseas, as distillers look to develop new opportunities in emerging markets such as China, and congratulates the Labour Government on maintaining this freeze on duty on whisky since 1997.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4172</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>An Energy Institute for the Energy Capital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement in the Budget of the creation of a new &pound;1 billion energy and environment research institute; considers that Aberdeen, as Europe&rsquo;s energy capital, would be the prime site for any such institute, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make the appropriate representations to the UK Government in order to push for this institute to be sited in Aberdeen.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4171</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Ensuring the Independence of Scottish National Statistics</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in light of the proposals from HM Treasury for the establishment of an independent UK Office for National Statistics, notes that no proposals were made for Scotland; further notes that such proposals for Scotland are the responsibility of the Scottish Executive, and considers that, in light of previous statistical issues such as the loss of Objective 1 funding for the Highlands and Islands through statistical error, the Executive should take similar measures to place the production of Scottish statistics on a statutory basis, incorporating the National Statistics Code of Practice, and establish an independent Office of Scottish Statistics with independent governance answerable directly to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4170</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Redundancies at James Watt College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the behaviour of senior management at James Watt College, Greenock and Kilwinning, in announcing on 15 March 2006 their intention to make 70 full-time equivalent academic posts redundant with the intention of filling these places with staff under new terms and conditions; congratulates the academic staff for their 97% &quot;yes&quot; vote in favour of industrial action in opposition to the management proposals to reduce staff and diminish terms and conditions of employment, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure the future viability of the college by sending a clear message that this type of behaviour by college management is unacceptable and detrimental to the education of students in both campuses.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4169</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Scotland&rsquo;s Paralympic Curling Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the UK Paralympic curling team which picked up the silver medal on 18 March 2006 in Turin, the members of which all come from Scotland; notes that Angie Malone, Tom Killin, Mick McCreadie, Frank Duffy and Ken Dickson achieved the silver in a heroic match against Canada, which came down to the last stone in the last end; is pleased to further note that the team will bring home Britain&rsquo;s first Paralympic winter games medal since 1994 and Britain&rsquo;s first winter games silver medal since 1992, and, finally, recognises that Tom Killin and Mick McCreadie are the first Olympians to win medals in games for both winter and summer games in both disabled and able-bodied competitors.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4168</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Taiwan&rsquo;s Exclusion from the WHO: Avian Flu</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses regret that Taiwan is currently excluded from the World Health Organisation (WHO) given current concerns over the spread of avian flu; recognises that Taiwan is geographically located in the hot-spot area of avian flu presence and plays host to many species of migratory birds, and urges the Scottish Executive to express a view to relevant bodies that it is essential that the WHO takes regard of the situation in Taiwan whilst, in broader terms, pointing out that, if the WHO is to succeed in co-ordinating and controlling actions in potential global pandemics, there should be no exclusion areas.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4167</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Public Information Broadcasts in the South of Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision by the Scottish government to stop public information broadcasts to the south of Scotland (Border TV) region, covering towns as far apart as Portpatrick in the west and Eyemouth in the east, and residents throughout the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway; further notes that over 5% of the Scottish population live in this TV region and are not now receiving public information broadcasts on issues such as anti-social behaviour, anti-racism, domestic abuse, the new legislation banning smoking in public places, fire safety and many other important notifications, and believes that the decision to halt broadcasts in 2004 has had a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of the people in the south of Scotland and that this decision is yet further evidence of the neglect of this region of Scotland by coalition ministers.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4148</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>In the Footsteps of Robert the Bruce</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes and commends the efforts to establish a heritage trail in memory of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, whose remarkable and historic victory over a superior English force at Bannockburn reinstated Scottish national independence; notes that Bruce&rsquo;s struggle against the &quot;chains and slavery&quot; of English domination was a defining mark in the history of Scotland; notes that 700 years after he came to power the desire of Scots to be once again free remains unabated amongst those of us who appreciate the real value of liberty and freedom; notes that the Ayrshire-born Bruce had many challenges and obstacles on the road to delivering independence for Scotland but that his commitment to our nation and his leadership of the Scots lie in stark contrast to the pinstriped political leadership Scotland has today, and calls on the Scottish Executive to back the proposed heritage trail and remember the man whose vision, charisma and military prowess led our nation to independence.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4147</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Decentralising UK Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Decentralising UK Energy</em>&nbsp;by the World Alliance for Decentralised Energy (WADE); notes that the report, which compares models of two possible future scenarios: centralised generation using nuclear power and a decentralised system in which energy is predominantly produced close to its point of use using renewables and combined heat and power, concludes that the United Kingdom can meet its targets for cuts in CO2 emissions without resorting to nuclear power and that overall the decentralised solution is far superior, being cleaner as CO2 emissions are 17% lower than in the nuclear scenario and cheaper as overall costs are over &pound;1 billion lower than in the nuclear scenario, even before the cost of managing nuclear waste is factored in, and believes that the Scottish Executive should give urgent consideration to how best to support and encourage the development of a sustainable energy policy based on renewable and micro-renewable technologies.</p>
