              to the general principles of the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) 
              Bill for the reasons set out in the stage 1 report of the Rural 
              Development Committee; and because it considers that, as an alternative, 
              the Executive should examine the issues identified in the report, 
              in particular paragraph 72 thereof, in order to address whether 
              the existing law against fox baiting provides adequate protection 
              against cruelty to wild mammals.&quot; </p>
            <p> <strong>S1M-2078.1</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Protection of Wild Mammals 
              (Scotland) Bill</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2078) in the

              adequately addresses the issues presented in evidence to the Rural 
              Development Committee and considers that the Scottish Executive, 
              as an alternative, should examine the existing law in relation to 
              wild mammals, in particular the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996, 
              in order to take action against any unnecessary suffering caused 
              through the provisions of this Act and to bring the legislation

              animals.&quot; </p>

          <p>debate on the subject of- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2088</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan:</strong> <strong>Waste Incinerators</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern that at least five large new incinerators 
            are being planned for siting around Scotland, despite the growing 
            evidence that they may frequently emit a cocktail of toxic chemicals 
            which breach legal pollution limits and raise health concerns; further 
            notes that the defect ridden Baldovie incinerator in Dundee reported 
            18 separate breaches of safety limits within a five week period earlier 
            this year, which more than justifies the concerns of communities in 
            Aberdeen about the planned Altens incinerator; is concerned that although 
            60% of the waste produced in Scotland is biodegradable, only 6.6% 
            of it was recycled last year, thereby placing Scotland at the bottom 
            of the European recycling league; commends the first area waste plan 
            in Scotland which opts for the recycling of waste rather than the 
            burning of it, and believes that the Scottish Executive should implement 
            policies which promote a resource efficient, recycling society. </p>
