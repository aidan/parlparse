            <p>followed<EM> by</EM> Executive Debate: Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland&mdash;</p>
            <p><STRONG>S2M-2155</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that continuing action is needed to turn round the poor health of many people in Scotland; supports the emphasis that the Scottish Executive has placed, across portfolios, on health promotion; agrees that the Executive is right in tackling the&nbsp;three big killers of coronary heart disease, cancer, and stroke and recognises the progress made to date in reducing mortality rates from these diseases; believes in putting patients first so that they are at the heart of NHS service developments and priorities, and supports the Executive&rsquo;s determination to target additional investment and increase capacity so that the next steps are focused on reducing waiting for out-patient appointments and hospital admissions, on speeding diagnostic tests and on extending patient choice.</p>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
              <p> <STRONG>S2M-2155.3</strong> <STRONG>Shona Robison: Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from first "supports" to end and insert "recognises the progress made in reducing mortality rates from coronary heart disease, cancer and stroke; believes in putting patients first by expanding capacity in the NHS to tackle unacceptably high waiting times for out-patient appointments and hospital admissions, and is concerned that any expansion of the private sector in Scotland can only be achieved at the expense of the NHS." </p>
              <p> <STRONG>S2M-2155.1</strong> <STRONG>Mr David Davidson: Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from "continuing" to end and insert "there is an urgent need to reform the NHS in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to place patients&rsquo; needs at the centre of the service, to give patients the choice to move anywhere within the NHS, to ensure that NHS capacity is supplemented where necessary by better collaboration and partnership with the independent and voluntary health and care sectors and to move to a system where money follows the patients, and further calls on the Executive to free health professionals and local managers to respond to patient needs on a local basis and to transfer resources away from bureaucracy and into front-line care." </p>
              <p> <STRONG>S2M-2155.4</strong> <STRONG>Carolyn Leckie: Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from "continuing" to end and insert "radical continuing action is needed to turn around the poor health of many people in Scotland, most of it poverty-related; further notes that the Scottish Executive needs to do much more if mortality and morbidity are to be drastically reduced, life expectancy increased and health inequalities removed; recognises that the most effective health promotion measure would be the eradication of poverty; recognises that, while Scotland&rsquo;s people continue to suffer unacceptable levels of ill-health, the NHS needs to have the capacity to treat patients quickly, effectively and as close to their homes as possible; believes that the NHS in Scotland has suffered unprecedented and unsustainable reductions of capacity, particularly through bed cuts, hospital closures, PFI and budget deficits in the last 10 years and that there needs to be an immediate reversal of that trend by securing the NHS as a publicly-owned, publicly-delivered, universal, comprehensive service free at the point of need with the capacity to meet the needs of the population, and considers private health care to be a parasitic drain on NHS assets, resources and staff that merely converts public money into private profit whilst undermining the founding principles of the NHS and threatens its very existence as envisioned by Aneurin Bevan." </p>
              <p> <STRONG>S2M-2155.2</strong> <STRONG>Dr Jean Turner: Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from first "supports" to end and insert "welcomes the additional investment on health promotion, including its targeting of heart disease, cancer and stroke; however, urges the Scottish Executive as part of its next steps strategy and to fulfil its aim of returning all patients to the heart of the NHS, to include as part of the strategy a comprehensive review of services dedicated to palliative care and chronic conditions and, further, develop a national programme of diagnostic care, all of which continue to be under-resourced and under-funded, and believes that such a review will save the NHS money by identifying, treating and controlling such conditions in a more structured, preventative and cost-effective manner which will alleviate the consequent pressure on hospital beds and in-patient services." </p>
