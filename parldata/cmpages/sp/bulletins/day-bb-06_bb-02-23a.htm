<p><strong>2.55 pm</strong>&#9;Executive Debate: Fair to All, Personal to Each &ndash; the Progress on Waiting&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-3990</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Fair to All, Personal to Each - the Progress on Waiting</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the significant progress made by NHS Scotland to reduce waiting times; applauds the dedication and hard work of all NHS staff who have helped meet the targets for patients; acknowledges the contribution made by the Scottish Executive through additional investment in the NHS; notes that partnerships with the independent healthcare sector have also contributed to the capacity available to treat NHS patients; supports the continuing work by the NHS to modernise and redesign services to further improve access and accelerate diagnosis and treatment, and supports the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to achieve further improvements in waiting times while securing a modern sustainable health service for Scotland on the basis of <em>Delivering for Health</em>. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S2M-3990.3</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Fair to All, Personal to Each - the Progress on Waiting</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3990) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;congratulates NHS staff for their hard work in delivering progress in meeting targets for patients with waiting time guarantees; however recognises the recent concerns of Audit Scotland that the number of people without a waiting time guarantee has increased, that nearly 24,000 patients have been waiting more than six months for in-patient and day case treatment and that the total number of people waiting for in-patient and day case treatment has changed little in the last two years; further notes that Audit Scotland&rsquo;s report, <em>Tackling Waiting Times in the NHS in Scotland</em>, regards the increased use of the private sector as being &quot;relatively high-cost&quot; compared to the NHS; welcomes the report&rsquo;s recommendation that there should be greater involvement and choice for patients, and therefore commends the SNP&rsquo;s Patient Rights proposals to provide every patient with an individual waiting time guarantee appropriate to them within national waiting time targets.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S2M-3990.1</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne: Fair to All, Personal to Each - the Progress on Waiting</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3990) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the progress in eliminating the longest waits; is concerned, however, at the corresponding rise in patients with Availability Status Codes who are not guaranteed treatment within the waiting times target; notes that the extra money going into the health service has not been matched by corresponding increases in productivity; further notes that, despite the efforts and hard work of the NHS staff, patients are not receiving the level of service they demand and deserve because of insufficient capacity to meet demand; is concerned by the stark health inequalities existing between each end of the social deprivation scale, local health service facilities being closed against the wishes of local communities and a slow adoption of new drugs and technologies, and believes that Scotland needs to move to a system with greater responsiveness to the needs of individual patients and communities, put power back in the hands of professionals to prioritise treatment by clinical need and increase the capacity available to treat NHS patients by extending the use of the independent sector.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S2M-3990.2</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Fair to All, Personal to Each - the Progress on Waiting</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3990) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;applauds the dedication and hard work of all NHS staff who have helped meet the targets for patients; notes that the NHS has insufficient core capacity and insufficient core staffing of establishments resulting in increased overtime and locum costs; believes that resources that should be directly spent on patient care are being diverted to increasing the profits of private health providers; believes that NHS patients treated by the private sector have had their care standards compromised, for example patients treated by the Advanced Centre for Eye Care (ACE) and those in England with severe respiratory illnesses made reliant on oxygen supplied by the private sector; believes that all private healthcare providers in Scotland should be urgently audited by Audit Scotland to determine whether the standards of care provided are putting patients at risk or imposing additional care burdens on NHS staff; believes that the NHS is under threat as a public health care system and that urgent action is required to protect and improve it, including increased investment in training to provide more NHS doctors, dentists, clinicians, other professionals and support staff to increase the NHS&rsquo;s own capacity, and believes that Scotland&rsquo;s stark health inequalities will only be intensified by the increased involvement of the private sector.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em><em>followed  by</em></em>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-3995</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mr Andrew Welsh be appointed to replace Michael Matheson as the Scottish National Party substitute on the Education Committee.</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-4000</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Membership of Committee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Mr Jamie Stone be appointed to replace Mike Pringle on the Subordinate Legislation Committee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong>&#9;Decision Time</p>
<p><em><em>followed  by</em></em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<p><em>&#9;</em>Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-3877</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Air Ambulance Trials in Orkney</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposal of the Scottish Ambulance Service to replace the Kirkwall-based BN Islander aircraft, successfully used for many years to provide air ambulance cover for Orkney, with an Inverness-based EC 135 helicopter which also covers a much wider area of the Highlands and Islands and beyond; further notes that trials of the helicopter on service in Orkney, carried out since spring 2005, have done little to provide assurances that it can provide even an equal level of service to that provided by the Islander aircraft, with particular concerns relating to its ability to fly in Orkney&rsquo;s winter weather and also its ability to provide adequate cover for the wide area it will be required to serve, and believes that, if the Kirkwall-based Islander aircraft is not retained as a back-up facility beyond the end of March 2006, Orkney will be left with poorer quality and potentially unsafe air ambulance cover. </p>
