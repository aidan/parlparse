          <p><strong>*S2M-1560</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Future 
            of Chapelcross</strong>-That the Parliament regards the closure of 
            Chapelcross nuclear power station as a significant<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"> 
            </FONT>milestone along the road to developing nuclear-free sources 
            of energy and employment longer term in the south of Scotland; notes 
            that over the next few years there will be more jobs created in decommissioning 
            the plant than there would be in operating a replacement nuclear power 
            station, and encourages &nbsp;the Corridor Regeneration Strategy Steering 
            Group to convert the site into a centre for renewable energy as part 
            of Scotland's long-term renewable energy future.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1558</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>No 
            Tour Charges in the People's Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament 
            condemns any attempt to charge the people of Scotland to go on tours 
            of their own<strong><em> </em></strong>new Parliament building, the 
            people having previously paid for it with over £430 million of public 
            money; views any such proposal as being in direct contradiction to 
            the Parliament's founding principles of access and participation and 
            opposes any attempt to impose such a charge; believes that the Scottish 
            Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB), in agreeing to recommend the 
            imposition of such charges, has once again demonstrated its complete 
            inability to take into account the views of the ordinary people of 
            Scotland, and calls on the SPCB to be expanded to include elected 
            representatives from civic Scotland to ensure that such views are 
            at the heart of future decision-making on the governance of the people's 
            parliament.</P>

            Week - 5 to 9 July 2004</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the 
            Chartered Society of Physiotherapy's Physiotherapy Week from 5 to 
            9 July 2004; notes that 850,000 working days were lost due to musculoskeletal 
            disorders last year in Scotland; recognises the value of workplace 
            physiotherapy in the fight against work-related ill health, and agrees 
            with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy that prevention is better 
            than cure.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1555</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>New 
            York Introduces Self-Extinguishing Cigarettes</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates New York State on the ban of sales of non-self-extinguishing 
            cigarettes within New York State; appreciates that this measure will 
            help in saving the lives of some of the 900 Americans who die each 
            year by fires started by cigarettes left unattended, and, given that 
            smoking-related fires are the most common reason for preventable deaths 
            reported by the Fire Service in Scotland and that under the Scotland 
            Act 1998 this issue is reserved to Westminster, urges the Scottish 
            Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to introduce 
            similar legislation in Scotland.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1554</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Protection 
            of Scotland's Coasts</strong>-That the Parliament notes the first 
            anniversary of the sinking of the <em>MV Jambo</em> in the Minch; 
            regrets the failure to protect one of Scotland's most important and 
            fragile marine areas and regards the overall protection of Scotland's 
            coasts as inadequate; calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce 
            further measures to ensure the conservation and protection of Scotland's 
            marine environment and that all the recommendations of the Donaldson 
            report which followed the Braer disaster are fully implemented, and 
            calls on the Scottish Executive to give further consideration to the 
            appointment of a dedicated minister for the marine environment to 
            deliver coherent government action on the seas.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1553</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Iraq 
            Remains Occupied</strong>-That the Parliament regards the alleged 
            handover of sovereignty from coalition occupying forces in Iraq as 
            completely fictitious; views the new Iraqi government as an unelected 
            puppet of the US regime, its sovereignty guaranteed by an army of 
            160,000 foreign fighters and 3,000 US diplomats; notes that the Iraqi 
            Prime Minister is a former CIA agent; notes that the new US embassy 
            in Baghdad will be the largest in the world and bigger than the Iraqi 
            government headquarters; notes that the US State Department has taken 
            $184m earmarked for drinking water projects and moved it to the budget 
            for the embassy; notes that the United States will continue to control 
            all aspects of Iraqi life through &quot;inspectors&quot; appointed 
            by the US; is outraged that 80,000 Western private mercenaries operating 
            on behalf of Western companies in Iraq have been given immunity from 
            prosecution for any crimes that they may commit including murder; 
            notes that the US will continue to detain some 5,000 Iraqis without 
            trial, and reaffirms its call for the immediate withdrawal of all 
            coalition troops from Iraq and the ending of the privatisation of 
            Iraq's infrastructure.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-1552</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Condolences 
            to the Family of Gordon Gentle</strong>-That the Parliament expresses 
            its deepest condolences to the family of Gordon Gentle who was tragically 
            killed in Iraq on 28 June 2004 at the age of only 19, and conveys 
            our thoughts, love and solidarity to Rose and George, his mother and 
            father, and Pamela and Maxine, his two sisters.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1545</strong> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> <strong>Cessation 
            of Power Generation at Chapelcross - The World's Oldest Operational 
            Nuclear Power Station</strong>-That the Parliament notes with regret 
            the formal announcement that the Chapelcross Power Station, the longest-serving 
            nuclear power station in the world, has ceased power generation, having 
            provided a safe and reliable supply of electricity to the south of 
            Scotland since 1959; believes that the engineering and scientific 
            accomplishments of designing, building and operating Chapelcross and 
            Calder Hall in Cumbria were the 20th century equivalent of the Forth 
            Rail Bridge or the invention of the steam engine and congratulates 
            the management and workforce on their skill and dedication in operating 
            successfully the Calder Hall and Chapelcross power stations for a 
            combined total of more than 90 years; further notes the fudge and 
            delay inherent in Her Majesty's Government's energy policy; expresses 
            concern at the prospects of a looming &quot;energy gap&quot; in the 
            United Kingdom that cannot realistically be filled by renewable sources, 
            and believes that the success of Chapelcross would be best recognised 
            by the early commissioning of a replacement nuclear power facility 
            on the same site.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1544</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>International 
            Youth Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Matthew 
            Middler and Fiona Smith of Aberdeen on being selected to represent 
            Scotland at an international youth parliament event in Sydney organised 
            by Oxfam International; welcomes the fact that Fiona Smith's attendance 
            at the event is being supported by UNISON, and notes that the event 
            will discuss key international issues including poverty, social justice, 
            and the environment.</P>
