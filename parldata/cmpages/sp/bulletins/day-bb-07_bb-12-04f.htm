<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-965</strong> <strong>Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>National Fostering and Kinship Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the needs of a child are paramount and that families should be supported to stay together; agrees that, where the child needs to live away from his or her birth parents, care within the family circle by a kinship carer should be the first option unless it is not in the best interests of the child; believes that all placements for a child who must live away from his or her birth parents must provide a safe and nurturing home, whether for a planned short-term period or on a permanent basis, and affirms its commitment to the provision of equitable and appropriate support for all carers of looked-after children, with systems in place to ensure that carers can provide the best possible opportunities and chances to all looked-after children.</p>
<p>Supported by: Maureen Watt<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-964</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Maureen Watt<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-963</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>St Aloysius Primary School&rsquo;s 150th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the pupils and staff at St Aloysius Primary on the school&rsquo;s 150th anniversary; recognises the significant part that the school has played in enhancing the lives of the children of Chapelhall during that period; further recognises the important role played by the 20 head teachers that the school has had since its inception in providing leadership and guidance to the young people of Chapelhall, and wishes staff and pupils well during their celebrations.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-962</strong> <strong>Bashir Ahmad:</strong> <strong>National Deaf Children&rsquo;s Society: Supporting Black and Minority Ethnic Families of Deaf Children Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that childhood deafness should not be a barrier to participating fully in the life of a modern Scotland; notes that there are approximately 2,922 deaf children living in Scotland today; acknowledges that the diverse and dynamic nature of Scotland&rsquo;s demographic means that a proportion of these children will be from black and minority ethnic (BME) families; acknowledges research which suggests that there is a greater prevalence of deafness among certain BME communities, with one study indicating the incidence of deafness to be 3.5 times greater for Asian children compared with non-Asian children; accepts that, without the appropriate support, deafness can make it harder for children to communicate, especially if English is not their first language; is aware that language and cultural differences can often restrict parents from accessing vital information from health and education professionals, preventing them from making informed choices about important issues in their deaf children&rsquo;s development; recognises the National Deaf Children&rsquo;s Society (NDCS) Scotland as the only Scottish charity dedicated to the support of all deaf children and young people, their families and professionals working with them regardless of their ethnic backgrounds, culture, and religion, and therefore congratulates NDCS Scotland on its Supporting Black and Minority Ethnic Families of Deaf Children project, which has initially been focused on families in Glasgow due to the high density volume of BME families in the city, on successfully establishing close links with organisations within BME communities and professionals working with deaf children, recruiting and training volunteer representatives from within BME communities who can further support families with deaf children and on ensuring that Scottish BME families have access to comprehensive information in order that they can make informed choices and get support with issues associated with childhood deafness.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-961</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Sgoil Lionacleit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Sgoil Lionacleit from the Isle of Benbecula for its victory in the BT National Gaelic Debate, held in the Parliament on 29 November 2007; notes the achievement of the Nicolson Institute from Stornoway in getting to the semi-finals; congratulates schools from all over Scotland for the standard of their debate; welcomes the outstanding contribution of Innes MacSween from Ness in Lewis for winning the prize of Best Individual Speaker in the competition, and notes the contribution of competitions like this in encouraging young Gaels to use and keep alive their language.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-960</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Fife Pies are the Best Pies!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates WF Stark butchers in Buckhaven on winning the annual World Scotch Pie Championships; notes that, with last year&rsquo;s winners Stuart&rsquo;s of Buckhaven also based in Fife, the Kingdom now has two world champion pie makers; congratulates the organisers of the championships; notes that Fife&rsquo;s butchers and bakers obviously have a clear aptitude for making a tasty pie, and suggests that Members visit the Kingdom of Fife to sample a pie, as part of a balanced diet, at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-959</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Prisoners with Learning Difficulties and Learning Disabilities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the report, <em>No One Knows</em>, produced by the Prison Reform Trust, based on interviews with prison staff in Scotland regarding the identification and support of prisoners with learning difficulties; notes the suggestion that up to 2,250 prisoners out of approximately 7,000 are likely to have a technical learning disability or require some additional support with learning; notes further that all public services, including criminal justice organisations, have a duty under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to eliminate discrimination and promote opportunity for disabled people, including those with learning difficulties; is concerned that few systematic procedures appear to be in place in prisons to identify prisoners with learning difficulties or disabilities and that information about this does not accompany most prisoners when they enter prison; is aware that short-term prison sentences militate against effective working with such prisoners; calls on the Scottish Executive to act on the recommendations of the report, and believes that there would be considerable value in a review of the care and treatment of prisoners with learning difficulties and disabilities by HM Inspectorate of Prisons and by the Scottish Commissioner for Equality and Human Rights, as recommended in the report.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-958</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Neurosurgergy Needs Assessment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the public opposition to centralising neurosurgery services and expresses its support for keeping the existing four neurological specialist centres; congratulates the organisers of the 25,000 signature petition to the Parliament, and recognises the prime importance of patient care in this issue and the inadequacies in coverage that one centralised unit would bring, also noting the lack of particular financial benefit of such a scheme as confirmed in the draft report on the national needs assessment for neurosurgery services.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-957</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Big Screens for International Games</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament encourages local authorities, in collaboration with the Scottish Football Association and local organisations such as football clubs, to facilitate the broadcasting of Scotland&rsquo;s international football matches on large video screens in central locations when terrestrial broadcast is not available, using ready-made stadia as possible venues, thus enabling a broader range of people to have the chance to show their support for the national side.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-956#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Fifth Annual Scots Trad Music Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hands Up For Trad for organising the fifth annual Scots Trad Music Awards, Comharrachadh Duaisean Dual-che&ograve;l na h-Alba 2007, held in the Nevis Centre, Fort William from 29 November to 1 December 2007; notes the attendance of 900 celebrants and 130 musicians who produced such a spectacular and enjoyable programme drawn from all aspects of our traditional music; congratulates the award winners whose performances have raised the excellence, rude health and growing recognition of Scotland&rsquo;s contemporary indigenous music bringing it to wider public notice each year, which acts as a barometer of a confident and innovative musical culture in today&rsquo;s Scotland but regrets that broadcasters have yet to televise this enjoyable event to take the live performance and celebration of our rich musical traditions onto our television screens, and considers that future awards ceremonies should be televised, starting with the sixth awards due to be held in Glasgow in 2008.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-955</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Music - BBC Scotland Televises Contemporary Traditional Music</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates BBC Scotland for producing the six-part series, Scotland&rsquo;s Music, compiled and presented by Phil Cunningham; notes growing public acclaim for the Scotland&rsquo;s Music series as an inspiring exploration of Scotland&rsquo;s musical traditions and heritage as well as acting as a great advert for the hugely varied scenery of our country, and calls on the BBC to show much more urgency in ensuring that the programme is screened throughout the United Kingdom and on worldwide channels and to ensure that the series should be available in CD and DVD formats before Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-873</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Threatened Closure of the King&rsquo;s Theatre in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the King&rsquo;s Theatre in Edinburgh faces closure following a decision by the City of Edinburgh Council not to fund a refurbishment plan until at least 2010; notes the comments of the Chief Executive of the Festival City Theatres Trust which runs the venue on the council&rsquo;s behalf that such a delay threatens the King&rsquo;s Theatre with closure on health and safety grounds within two years; recognises the important contribution that the Tollcross venue has made in its 101-year history to the cultural life of Edinburgh, the Lothians and the east of Scotland and which continues today, including its role in Edinburgh&rsquo;s festivals; believes that funding for refurbishment should be prioritised accordingly, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to enter into funding negotiations with the Scottish Government and the Festival City Theatres Trust with a view to securing a viable future for the King&rsquo;s Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-873.2</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Threatened Closure of the King&rsquo;s Theatre in Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-873) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out from &quot;following a decision&quot; to end and insert &quot;despite a promise by City of Edinburgh Council Leader, Councillor Jenny Dawe, in May 2007 to give &quot;top priority&quot; to reviving plans for a refurbishment of the King&rsquo;s Theatre; notes the comments of the Chief Executive of the Festival City Theatres Trust which runs the venue on the council&rsquo;s behalf that a delay threatens the King&rsquo;s Theatre with closure on health and safety grounds within two years; recognises the important contribution that the Tollcross venue has made in its 101-year history to the cultural life of Edinburgh, the Lothians and the east of Scotland and which continues today, and calls on the current ruling Lib Dem/SNP council administration to honour the promise made to the people of Edinburgh only a matter of months ago.&quot;</p>
