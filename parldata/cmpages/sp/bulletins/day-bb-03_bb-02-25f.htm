wish to be considered for debate as members&#146; business in the Parliament are 
marked with a hash symbol (#)</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3944</STRONG> <STRONG>Mary 
Scanlon: Health</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges that funding for 
the NHS in Scotland has continued to increase since the Parliament was established; 
regrets, however, that this increase in funding has only come about as a result 
of an increase in the tax burden imposed on everyone in Scotland and that it has 
not led to an improvement in the service for patients, who have to wait longer 
for treatment and face the prospect of being forced to go abroad to get the treatment 
they need in a reasonable time; believes that the Scottish Executive&#146;s centralising 
approach is not working because, despite the best efforts of NHS staff, the current 
centralised, monopoly system of providing healthcare wastes too much money and 
therefore does not result in an improvement in front-line patient care, and calls 
on the Executive to match the extra investment with a sustained and coherent programme 
of reform that builds on the NHS&#146;s fundamental values of high-quality healthcare 
available to all, irrespective of their ability to pay, and seeks to realise these 
values by putting the needs and expectations of patients at the heart of the service 
by ensuring that money follows patients so that they have real choice over the 
treatment they receive, creating a partnership between the NHS and the independent 
sector so that all our facilities are used to cut waiting lists and times for 
NHS patients and devolving power to GPs and local hospitals so that NHS staff 
have far more say in how the health service is run so that it responds to the 
real needs of patients.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3943</STRONG> <STRONG>Cathy Jamieson: 
Educational Attainment for Looked After Children</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
recognises that young people looked after by local authorities require support 
to enable them to have the best possible educational opportunity; welcomes the 
use made of the £10 million allocated to local authorities to support educational 
attainment of looked after children, and notes that, while progress has been made 
on implementing the recommendations made in <EM>Learning With Care</EM>, continued 
effort must be made to ensure that every looked after child has an appropriate 
care plan, including a plan for education, and is in full time education provision 
appropriate to need and that staff in social work and education work together 
to support all looked after children to reach their full potential.</P><P>Supported 
by: Nicol Stephen<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3942</STRONG> <STRONG>Brian 
Adam: Chewing Gum Disposal</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament applauds Councillor 
Kevin Stewart and Aberdeen City Council in their endeavours to try and get the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s agreement to introduce a levy on chewing gum 
manufacturers, the proceeds of which would be allocated to local authorities to 
clean up the mess created by those who discard their gum on our streets and pavements; 
notes that other local authorities are backing Councillor Stewart's original motion 
because cleaning up chewing gum costs millions of pounds each year, and furthermore 
believes that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should introduce this sensible proposal 
in his forthcoming budget.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3941#</STRONG> <STRONG>Christine 
Grahame: Children of Iraq - Collateral Damage</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
notes the concerns of Save the Children regarding the humanitarian consequences 
of military action against Iraq, that half the Iraqi population is comprised of 
children under the age of 14, that 70% of the population lives in towns and cities, 
that 60% are poor and dependent on food rations, that 11.4% of Iraqi children 
in North Iraq and 23.1% in Central and South Iraq are still chronically malnourished, 
that under-five child mortality in Central and South Iraq has deteriorated by 
160% due to sanctions, that a cut in the food ration provided under the Oil-for-Food 
programme would trigger even greater poverty, that Iraqi children are forced to 
drink water that often contains up to ten times the acceptable level of contamination 
and that the number of internally-displaced persons is already estimated to be 
between 700,000 and one million; further notes that, against this background, 
Save the Children is "deeply concerned" at the possibility of renewed conflict 
as military action would have serious humanitarian consequences for Iraq's vulnerable 
children, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make all possible representations 
to prevent this war by addressing the likely impact on the vulnerable and innocent 
children of Iraq.</P><P>Supported by: Brian Adam<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3940#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Trish Godman: Shipbuilding on the Upper and Lower Clyde</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament, in the light of recent and forthcoming Ministry of Defence contracts, 
is confident that the shipyards on the upper and lower Clyde have a sound future 
with the welcome retention, and expansion in the range of the superb skills that 
characterise the industry at its best and believes, however, that these yards, 
from Port Glasgow to Scotstoun and Govan, require from time to time appropriate 
and judicious support from the Scottish Executive in order to strengthen this 
now small but vitally important industry and that this can be best achieved by 
strengthening the existing close working relationship with management and the 
trade unions.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3939</STRONG> <STRONG>Margo MacDonald: Prostitution 
Tolerance Zones (Scotland) Bill</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament agrees to the 
general principles of the Prostitution Tolerance Zones (Scotland) Bill.</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3937

Helen Eadie<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Murdo Fraser<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Margaret Jamieson<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Johann Lamont<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Fiona McLeod<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3932*#*</STRONG> 
<STRONG>David Mundell: Post Office Card Accounts</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
<A NAME="MotionText">believes that those post office customers in Scotland who 
wish to continue receiving their benefits, pensions payments and tax credits through 
the Post Office, following the introduction of automated credit transfer in April 
2003, should be allowed to do so through a post office card account opened at 
the counter of a post office or sub-post office; further believes that customers 
should be offered a genuine choice between the options available, including a 
post office card account; supports the National Federation of SubPostmasters&#146; 
call that there should be no administrative obstacles to customers opening a post 
office card account; notes the importance of post office card accounts to the 
future financial viability of sub-post offices, and *considers that Scottish ministers 
should* work with Her Majesty&#146;s Government to ensure that there is a level 
playing field in the marketing, promotion and advertising of the banking options 
from all departments of Her Majesty&#146;s Government, including the Department 
for Work and Pensions, the Inland Revenue and the Veterans Agency, the Scottish 
Executive and its agencies and local authorities. </A></P><P>Supported by: Christine
