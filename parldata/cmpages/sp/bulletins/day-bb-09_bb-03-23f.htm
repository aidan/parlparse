<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3765</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>North Sea Oil and Gas Tax Regime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the strategic economic importance of the oil and gas industry, which contributes over a third of UK corporation tax to HM Treasury and notes that up to 25 billion barrels of oil and gas still remain to be extracted; realises that to attract the investment required to develop these reserves the North Sea must remain competitive; further notes with concern that since 2004 costs have doubled and that the rate of tax charged on new developments has risen to 50% and that the oil and gas industry projects that 50,000 jobs are at risk if investment ceases; calls on the Westminster government urgently to review the tax regime, and also calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ensure that banks make credit lines available to the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3764</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund&rsquo;s 90th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 90th anniversary of the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund (RAFBF) on 31 March 2009, marked by the celebratory event in the Great Hall of Edinburgh Castle; further notes the significant contribution that the RAFBF has made to existing and ex-service personnel and their families across Scotland; in particular, praises the RAFBF on its recent announcement of a &pound;750,000 contribution to Erskine Hospital Ltd to build housing for ex-service personnel and their families; welcomes the RAFBF&rsquo;s support to promote concessionary rates for a number of council services for all veterans across Scotland as a mark of respect to those who have served their country; looks forward in anticipation to the celebrations, and wishes the RAFBF every success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3763</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>The Glasgow School of Art Launches International Competition</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Glasgow School of Art launching an international competition to design a new campus building opposite its iconic Mackintosh building in the heart of Garnethill; notes that the successful architect-led team will design and deliver the first phase of a two-phase project to create an urban campus, and believes that the project will result in a building that is as inspirational to current and future generations of staff and students as the renowned Mackintosh building, demonstrated by the many thousands of tourists who visit the Mackintosh building every year, will ensure world-class facilities for teaching and research and will enhance the school&rsquo;s international reputation.</p>
<p>Supported by: Patricia Ferguson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3762&diams;</strong> <strong>Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>St Bridget&rsquo;s Chapel and the Mary&rsquo;s Meals Backpack Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the work of the Mary&rsquo;s Meals international movement and in particular the group working from St Bridget&rsquo;s Chapel in Baillieston; commends the initiative, which is helping to feed over 350,000 children in poor areas of the globe on a daily basis, encouraging hungry children to attend school to be fed and, through education, gain a better future for themselves and their communities; expresses great pride in the fact that Mary&rsquo;s Meals is based in Glasgow and administers volunteers and feeding programmes in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and recognises the hard work of the volunteers at St Bridget&rsquo;s who participate in the Backpack Project, providing deprived children across five continents with school bags and school essentials donated by local community members.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3760</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Israeli War Crimes Confirmed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns in the strongest possible terms what has come to light from the admission by Israeli troops in testimonies made to Danny Zamir, head of the Rabin pre-military academy, that civilians were deliberately targeted during Israel&rsquo;s recent offensive in Gaza, including accounts of an unarmed old woman being shot, a woman and her two children being killed after Israeli soldiers ordered them from their house and into the line of fire of a sniper and soldiers clearing houses by shooting anyone whom they came across; expresses serious concern that many soldiers believed that they were fighting a religious war given the fact that booklets distributed by military rabbis had given the clear message that &quot;we are the Jewish people, we have come to the land by miraculous means, and now we have to fight to remove the Gentiles who are getting in our way and preventing us from occupying the Holy Land&quot;; believes that this amounts to the admission that the Israeli state is operating a programme of ethnic cleansing, and calls on the international community to initiate proceedings to bring those responsible for these atrocities to justice and for international sanctions to be placed on Israel.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3711</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Seizing the Assets of Economic Terrorists</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, while disapproving of the use of the fear of terrorism to erode civil liberties and human rights, urges the UK Government to be consistent in its application of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001; considers that the executive actions of those who ran Scottish and UK banks resulted in thousands of job losses and required the injection of billions of pounds of taxpayers&rsquo; money to prevent the collapse of the banking system; holds that these collective failures could be considered to be economic terrorism on an unprecedented scale and that the full weight of the law is, therefore, required to protect and recover taxpayers&rsquo; money, and, accordingly, urges the UK Government to use the powers that it has by virtue of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 to seize the assets of these individuals.</p>
