<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6383 Joe FitzPatrick: Eco-Schools Award for Ss Peter and Paul RC Primary School in Dundee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ss Peter and Paul RC Primary School in Dundee on achieving a bronze award in the Eco-Schools ratings; recognises the hard work carried out by the staff and pupils to make the school more environmentally friendly; notes that new initiatives such as the introduction of litter wardens and recycling and energy monitors contributed to winning the award; commends Ss Peter and Paul RC Primary School for achieving bronze status, and supports Eco-Schools awards as an important tool to raise the awareness of children about  environmental and conservation issues.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6382 Margaret Mitchell: The Lighthouse Foundation Kilmarnock</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Lighthouse Foundation, based in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, on its nomination in the Community Action category at the 2010 Scottish Charity Awards; acknowledges that this nomination highlights the work of the foundation&rsquo;s programme to raise drug awareness in schools and colleges and its continuing efforts to help the families of drug users; recognises that the charity has helped over 300 families in the past year, and considers that the Scottish Charity Awards represent an excellent way to thank Scotland&rsquo;s charities for their effort and dedication, highlighting the various good causes that these charities help and promote.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6381 Karen Gillon: Geppetto Nursery School Earns Second Green Flag Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff, pupils and parents of Geppetto Nursery School in Carluke on being awarded their second Eco-Schools Scotland Green Flag; notes the comments of the Eco-Schools assessment officer in praising the strong community spirit in the school and the wider community in Carluke; recognises the benefits that the Eco-Schools programme has brought to the school both through a better understanding of environmental issues and through the opportunities that it offers to develop early literacy and numeracy skills, and wishes the school well in taking this success forward in the coming years.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6329 Bob Doris: Redundancy Avoidance at University of Glasgow Faculty of Biomedical and Life Sciences</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern at the University of Glasgow&rsquo;s proposals to restructure the Faculty of Biomedical and Life Sciences with the loss of around 18 staff posts through redundancy; notes that the exact detail of these cuts will not be known until the end of July 2010, which is causing anxiety for staff and students, and that the effect on course offerings for academic year 2010-11 is yet unknown; recognises the constructive efforts of faculty staff to assist in financial savings that have already reached &pound;1 million, including accepting the possibility of a 5% wage cut and reduced hours of work; is concerned that the university&rsquo;s management of both student admissions and financial targets for universal teaching cost reductions have further impacted on the faculty&rsquo;s situation; notes that new criteria prevent struggling faculties from being supported by more profitable faculties, and calls on University of Glasgow Principal and Vice-Chancellor Professor Anton Muscatelli to meet with staff representatives once more to explore alternatives to redundancy within the faculty and to reassure both staff and students about the university&rsquo;s commitment to the faculty for the coming academic year.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-6328 Bill Wilson: VAT Hits the Poor</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the warning issued by Save the Children in Scotland that raising VAT to 20% could mean a &pound;31-a-week bill for the poorest families in Scotland and that the poorest 10% of the population currently spend 14% of their disposable income on VAT, compared with only 5% for the richest, and calls on the UK Government not to raise VAT but to adopt progressive rather than regressive taxation policies and do all in its power to eliminate tax evasion and tax avoidance by the wealthy.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-6327 Robert Brown: Legal Status of Strathclyde Police Taser Pilots</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the legal analysis commissioned by Amnesty International indicating that the Strathclyde Taser pilot is unlawful; notes that under this pilot 30 frontline police officers were supplied with Taser weapons following a three-day training course; further notes that this legal analysis concluded that Scottish ministers are required to give written authorisation before any new scheme to arm police officers can take place; understands that no such authorisation has been obtained for the Strathclyde pilot; further notes the legal advice given to Amnesty International that while firearms legislation is reserved to the UK Parliament, control over firearms policy and the delivery of existing legislation has been specifically devolved to the Scottish Ministers; recognises that this is at odds with the assertion by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, made during a debate on the Strathclyde pilot on 25 February 2010, that &quot;Since the matter is a reserved responsibility, this Parliament has no locus to intervene, and the decision about how best to apply the existing legislation is an operational matter for each police force&quot;; recognises that it was the Home Secretary who signed off on issuing Tasers to frontline police officers in England and Wales; believes that extending the use of Tasers beyond firearms officers represents a shift in policy, not an operational decision, which requires ministerial sanction and which has serious human rights implications; further believes that there is need for proper debate on the implications of further arming police officers, and, in light of the doubts about the legal position, calls for the Strathclyde pilot to be halted in order that these issues be resolved.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-6323# Margo MacDonald: The Status of Scottish Parliament Elections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that, in order to preserve the status of the Parliament in Edinburgh and the standards of operational accountability and transparency established by MSPs since 1999 and in view of the Parliament&rsquo;s acceptance of the findings of the Independent Review of the Scottish Parliamentary and Local Government Elections, there is a need for a<strong> </strong>method of holding any fixed-term Westminster elections that does not coincide with the dates set for the four-year, fixed-term Scottish Parliament elections.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-6299# Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell: Employment and Support Allowance, Unfit for Purpose</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the workings of the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA); notes evidence from the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) Service in Scotland that uncovers serious hardship experienced by ESA claimants across Scotland; considers that sickness benefits should support people in finding employment if they are able to work, but must also provide help for those who are not; considers that ESA is failing to find this balance and is putting pressure on sick and disabled people in Scotland; notes in particular claims that the work capability assessment of ESA is making unsuitable decisions on claimants&rsquo; fitness for work and that 70% of CAB appeals against these decisions are being upheld, and *would welcome a review of ESA aimed at making it* work in the interests of the genuinely sick and disabled people of Central Scotland and the rest of the country.</p>
