          <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an "R".</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

          <p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3135#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Wallace and Moray Commemoration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes BBC Radio Scotland&rsquo;s vibrant new series which interprets the history of William Wallace and Andrew de Moray when they raised the Scots banner to regain Scotland&rsquo;s independence; believes that the ideas and inspirations of medieval Scots, their allies and neighbours should form an essential part of every child&rsquo;s experience in Scottish schools, and considers that the Minister for Education and Young People should make a response in this 700th anniversary year of Wallace&rsquo;s execution to indicate how such key events in Scotland&rsquo;s history can be brought to life as part of a critically-tested, multi-cultural curriculum.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3134</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Asia-Pacific Climate Deal</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the signing by the United States of America (USA), Australia, Japan, India, China and South Korea of the Asia-Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate, a regional pact to combat greenhouse gas emissions; welcomes all international efforts to tackle climate change, but feels that the Kyoto Protocol, an existing agreement to tackle climate change based on binding emissions reductions, is the best first step on the long road towards building a sustainable future and that any alternative grouping risks undermining the progress that Kyoto has already made; wonders just how committed the USA and Australia are to genuine progress on climate change, given that neither country has seen fit to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, and strongly believes that effective action to curb greenhouse gas emissions need not place an intolerable burden on the economy of any nation and will in fact be far less expensive in the long term than inaction.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3133</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Concern About Racist Headlines Following on from London Bombings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament views the <em>Daily Express </em>headline from 27 July 2005, &quot;Bombers are all spongeing asylum seekers&quot;, with deep concern; believes that, as well as being factually incorrect, the headline is an incitement to racial hatred as defined in Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 and could result in attacks on both individuals and minority communities; notes that, according to the Muslim Safety Forum which works closely with the police, the number of faith-related attacks in London has increased by 500% compared with the same period last year; believes that everything possible should be done to rebuild good community relations and prevent a further escalation in race hatred, and, therefore, calls for a halt to such irresponsible journalism and for action to be taken against the editors and journalists concerned.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3132</strong> <strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle:</strong> <strong>Support Local Produce</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the development of locally produced food and drink across Scotland; further supports initiatives designed to increase publicity about local produce; agrees that our rural communities deserve the right to flourish and prosper and that local produce is good for local economies, businesses and for the community, and notes the efforts of the European LEADER+ initiative in creating community-led rural projects throughout the country and in producing the new Loch Lomond and rural Stirling &quot;Buy Local&quot; food and drink directory.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3131</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>National Parks and Poets Laureate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the competition being run by the Peak District National Park in England to run a literary competition with the intention of appointing its own poet laureate; recognises that there has long been an inspirational connection between the land and the literary arts and that the lands bounded by Scotland&rsquo;s national parks have already inspired some of our best-known poetry and song; believes that a post of poet laureate, makar, bard or writer-in-residence would be a positive development for Scotland&rsquo;s new national parks, and urges the boards of the Cairngorms National Park Authority and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority to actively consider such a move.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3130</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Well Done to Central Scotland Police</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament praises the excellent work of Central Scotland Police officers in playing such an important part in providing security for the G8 summit; supports the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland President, Peter Wilson&rsquo;s, comments that all the police involved had &quot;delivered a safe and secure environment for the G8 leaders to meet&quot;, &quot;allowed peaceful protest&quot; and had &quot;quickly responded to violent disorder&quot;, and utterly condemns those violent protestors and mindless thugs who caused so much disruption and damage in Bannockburn and areas of Stirling and only caused to deflect attention away from the serious issues that the thousands of peaceful protestors from across Scotland, the United Kingdom and Europe were trying to address.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3129</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Multiple Sclerosis Research</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the fact that Scotland has the highest rates of multiple sclerosis in the world, with over 10,500 people currently affected; recognises the pain and distress this disease causes to both those affected and their families; acknowledges and fully supports the hard work undertaken by the many charities in this field, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make a commitment to invest in research into multiple sclerosis and further to invest in support for those affected and their families as a matter of priority.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3128</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Banned for Being Poor</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of the UK Government to deny visas to five teams from Africa who had hoped to participate in the Homeless World Cup 2005 held in Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh, despite the fact that tournament organisers had been working with the Government for months arranging entry for the participating countries; notes that the teams who were excluded by the UK Government are from Burundi, Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria and Zambia; finds it ironic that the reason given for the rejection was that the teams did not have sufficient funds to support themselves, when only a couple of weeks earlier during Live 8 events the same Government was wringing its hands and promising to help the poor in Africa yet was not willing to allow some of the poorest people from the poorest countries, who have climbed huge personal mountains in terms of getting fit and being part of a team in order to participate in the games, to even enter the United Kingdom; is concerned that poorer people are discriminated against in this way; regrets the disappointment and rejection felt by the teams and their supporters, and sends greetings and solidarity to all concerned.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3127</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Unveiling of Plaque in Honour of John Miller CE FRSE</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling of a commemorative plaque at Haymarket station in tribute to Scottish railway pioneer, John Miller, on the occasion of the bicentenary of his birth on 26 July, presented by the Institution of Civil Engineers; notes that Miller engineered most of Scotland&rsquo;s early main lines, including the first cross-border line and the Edinburgh to Glasgow line for which Haymarket was the capital&rsquo;s terminus; congratulates Professor Roland Paxton of Heriot-Watt University on his efforts to secure the recognition Miller deserves as one of the outstanding British railway engineers, and calls on all stakeholders to honour his legacy by continuing improvements to make Haymarket a modern, accessible transport hub fit for the 21st century.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3126</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>UK Use of Depleted Uranium</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that the Secretary of State for Defence admits that approximately 1.9 tonnes of depleted uranium were used in munitions deployed by UK tanks during the 2003 Iraq conflict; recognises that depleted uranium presents a hazard to the personal health of Iraq&rsquo;s children and non-combatant adults; notes with alarm that this quantity was twice as much depleted uranium as was used during the 1990-91 Gulf War, and urges the UK Government to implement a policy of searching for, gathering and safely disposing of all remnants of depleted uranium in Iraq and Afghanistan and ceasing to use depleted uranium in munitions in the future.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3125</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Refugee Status and Leave to Remain in the UK</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned at the proposal in the UK Government&rsquo;s five-year strategy for asylum and immigration to end the practice of granting indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom to people who are given refugee status and to replace this with up to five years&rsquo; temporary leave to remain&nbsp;in the country; believes that, while this may not be legally incompatible with the provisions of the 1951 Geneva Convention, it is a retrograde step as it reverses the policy of granting indefinite leave introduced by the Government in 1998 without any evidence that problems have arisen as a result of the current policy or that other countries which grant only temporary leave benefit as a result; is further concerned that the uncertain position this will put refugees in is totally inconsistent with other Government policies to assist the integration of refugees in the UK; believes that this will inevitably lead to inhumane decisions when refugee families with children are threatened with removal after living in the UK for several years and establishing family life, leading in turn to further pressure on the immigration appeals system and the caseload of MSPs, and urges the Government to abandon this unnecessary change.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3124</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>GM Superweeds</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is shocked, but not surprised, at the news that cross-fertilisation between GM oilseed rape and a distantly related plant, charlock, has resulted in herbicide-resistant superweeds in a field used for GM crop trials; notes that the accidental development of such superweeds was dismissed as impossible by UK Government scientists and the biotechnology industry prior to the trials taking place; acknowledges the many concerns raised, also in advance of the GM crop trials, that such horizontal gene transfer and the resulting emergence of superweeds was inevitable and that conducting these trials in the open would lead to irreversible genetic contamination of the environment, and calls on the Scottish Executive, in light of this evidence, to rule out any future releases of GMOs into the environment.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3123</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>ChildLine Funding Crisis</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff and volunteers of ChildLine on providing a 24-hour helpline for children in need for almost 20 years; notes with concern the news that lack of donations may mean that the night service may have to be axed; further notes that children who access the night service are often in considerable distress; recognises ChildLine&rsquo;s key role in referring cases to the relevant emergency and social services; urges MSPs and members of the public to make a donation to the emergency appeal to maintain the night service in the short term, and calls on government bodies to review their current statutory funding arrangements with the charity with a view to safeguarding the future of the service in the longer term.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-3122</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Ghost Towns</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is alarmed by the devastating impacts of out-of-town retail parks, shopping malls and superstores on local retail businesses; is concerned by recent reports that the independent retail sector in Inverness is struggling to survive, with the loss of 22 small shops in the town centre so far this year, and believes that Inverness exemplifies a Scotland-wide problem; notes that the New Economics Foundation&rsquo;s report, <em>Ghost Town Britain</em>, states that &quot;the decline of both small shops and wholesalers is closely linked to the ever-tightening stranglehold exercised by a handful of supermarket chains over the country&rsquo;s food retailing&quot;; regrets the detrimental effect on local economies, producers and communities of the big four supermarkets&rsquo; control of 75% of food retail in the United Kingdom, and urges the Scottish Executive to take all or any steps within its powers to stop the loss of local butchers, bakers, grocers and other small-scale retailers vital to the life of our communities.</p>
