<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Care Home Costs&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-7422 Mary Scanlon: Care Home Costs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the changing demographics of Scotland and the increasing financial pressures on services providing care for older people; notes that independent and local authority-run care homes in Scotland are regulated in accordance with standards set by the Care Commission; further notes the wide disparities that exist between different service providers with regard to fees and costs and the disparities in the amounts paid by or on behalf of service users for the same service, and accordingly calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that its public engagement process, Reshaping Care for Older People, reviews existing models of funding and provision to ensure that value for money is coupled with continuing high standards of care. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-7422.1 Shona Robison: Care Home Costs</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7422) in the name of Mary Scanlon, leave out from the first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the need to shiftthe balance of care; notes that independent and local authority-run care homes in Scotland are regulated by the Care Commission in accordance with standards set by ministers, and further recognises the opportunity through the Reshaping Care programme public engagement process to examine existing models of provision and funding across all care sectors and care settings to ensure that value for money is coupled with continuing high standards of care.&quot;&#8234; </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by </em>Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Prescription Charges&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-7423 Derek Brownlee: Prescription Charges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the financial pressures on the NHS and that the Independent Budget Review established by the Scottish Government has estimated that the full abolition of prescription charges would remove a further &pound;25 million of income each year from the NHS and accordingly calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider its position on prescription charges. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-7423.1 Nicola Sturgeon: Prescription Charges</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7423) in the name of Derek Brownlee, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that the abolition of prescription charges will benefit all those patients with long-term conditions and the 600,000 people on low incomes who are not entitled to exemption and further recognises that total abolition is in the best tradition of the NHS and that poor people and sick people should not be made to pay the cost of the economic and financial situation that Scotland faces.&quot; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment to amendment</p>
      <p><strong>S3M-7423.1.1 Jackie Baillie: Prescription Charges</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-7423.1) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end &quot;, but regrets that free prescriptions for cancer patients in Scotland were not implemented by April 2009 in line with England.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> <strong>S3M-7423.2 Ross Finnie: Prescription Charges</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7423) in the name of Derek Brownlee, insert at end &quot;, prescribing practice, medicines management, adverse reactions to medicine and procurement and purchasing of drugs.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-7427 Jim Mather: AV Referendum and 2011 Scottish Parliament Election Clash</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with real concern the UK Government&rsquo;s intention to hold a referendum on voting reform for UK Parliament elections on the same day as elections to the Scottish Parliament and other devolved institutions in May 2011; regrets the UK Government&rsquo;s failure to consult the Scottish Government or the Scottish Parliament on this matter, and calls on the UK Government to work with the Scottish Government to agree a new date that will avoid a clash with elections to this parliament. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-7427.2 David McLetchie: AV Referendum and 2011 Scottish Parliament Election Clash</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7427) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from first &quot;with&quot; to end and insert &quot;that holding a referendum on voting reform for UK Parliament elections on the same day as elections to the Scottish Parliament and other devolved institutions in May 2011 will save the taxpayer &pound;17 million and commends Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government for its wise stewardship of public finances in this respect.&quot; </p>

<p><em>followed by</em> Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><strong>5.00 pm</strong> Decision Time</p>
<p><em>followed by</em> Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em> </em>Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-6654 Nanette Milne: Increasing Access to Self-monitoring and Self-management of Anticoagulation Therapy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the levels of self-monitoring and self-management in Scotland for anticoagulation therapy are considerably lower than in England and the rest of western Europe; notes that the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (Yorkhill) in Glasgow, which looks after all young people on anticoagulation therapy, has achieved considerable success with the training of young people to self-monitor and self-manage their anticoagulation therapy but that there is no support for them when they move to adult clinics; notes that authoritative studies confirm the cost-effectiveness of self-monitoring and self-management; further notes the Cochrane Review meta-analysis confirming the clinical benefits and outcomes of self-monitoring and self-management; challenges the view of some NHS boards and clinicians that anticoagulation monitoring and management require to be undertaken in secondary care; points to what it considers to be the costly and time-consuming practice of bringing patients from outlying areas to hospitals rather than manage them in primary care; reminds the Scottish Government that its policy document, <em>Better Health, Better Care, </em>states that &quot;patients living with long-term medical conditions and their carers should have the information and support that they need to manage their condition on a day-to-day basis, in the knowledge that the NHS is there for them when they need it&quot;, and would welcome encouragement being given to NHS boards to increase access to self-monitoring and self-management of anticoagulation therapy for those patients in north east Scotland and the rest of the country who, with the endorsement of their clinicians, wish to do so. </p>
