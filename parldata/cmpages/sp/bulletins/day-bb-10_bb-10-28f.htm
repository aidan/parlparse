<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7281 Aileen Campbell: First Cardinal for Zambia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Archbishop Medardo Mazombwe, the retired archbishop of Lusaka, Zambia, on being appointed as a cardinal of the Catholic Church by Pope Benedict XVI; notes that Archbishop Mazombwe is the first Zambian to be made a cardinal, and considers that this is a great honour both for the Archbishop and the country; understands that Archbishop Mazombwe was a strong advocate for the cancellation of international debt during the Jubilee 2000 campaign, and hopes that he and his fellow cardinals will use their positions to champion causes of peace and justice around the world.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-7280 Bob Doris: Alasdair Gray Rejects Lib Dem Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges what it considers to be the utter disillusionment felt by many people who voted Liberal Democrat for the first time at the May 2010 UK General Election; understands that one such voter is the acclaimed Scots novelist and artist Alasdair Gray and that, following what it believes are the savage cuts brought to Scotland by the UK Conservative and Liberal Democrat government, Mr Gray has now withdrawn his support for the Liberal Democrats and will once again support the Scottish National Party.</p>
