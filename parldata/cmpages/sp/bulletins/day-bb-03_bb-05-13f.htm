          <p><strong>*S2M-14</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane: M74 Northern Extension</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament expresses its complete opposition to the M74 Northern 
            Extension; recognises that the process by which this proposal has 
            been pursued, the monies already spent and the estimated cost of the 
            project have failed the people of Glasgow; condemns the Scottish Executive's 
            lack of provision of an alternative public transport system for this 
            part of Glasgow and its apparent disregard for local concerns and 
            needs; calls on the Executive to review its transport policy so that 
            it properly reflects the needs and desires of the Scottish people, 
            and, in the case of the M74 extension, calls for an immediate public 
            inquiry including an environmental impact assessment and proper exploration 
            of alternative options.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-13#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: A9</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament recognises the dangers of the A9 trunk road between 
            Perth and Inverness and, in particular, the confusion to motorists 
            caused by switching between dual and single carriageway, which adds 
            to the accident statistics; notes the support of Tayside Police for 
            the dualling of the A9 in its entirety with improved junctions and 
            adequate rest areas in the interests of road safety; further notes 
            the increase in traffic year-on-year on the A9, which has been assisted 
            by economic growth in the Inverness area, and therefore supports the 
            calls from local campaigners for the Scottish Executive to make a 
            commitment to a programme of dualling the A9 between Perth and Inverness.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-12</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: South Lanarkshire 
            Council Secondary School Public Private Partnership Proposal and Hamilton</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament shares the concerns of parents and pupils in Hamilton 
            regarding the public private partnership secondary school proposal 
            of South Lanarkshire Council which, if implemented, will mean the 
            closure of Earnock High School; notes that local residents feel so 
            strongly with regard to the closure of this school that they have 
            elected two independent &quot;save our schools&quot; councillors to 
            the council; further notes the concern of parents in Hamilton that 
            the council's consultation process is inadequate, and calls on the 
            council and the Minister for Finance and Public Services, in consideration 
            of the local community's deep-felt anxiety on this issue, to reconsider 
            this deeply flawed proposal.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-11</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani: South Lanarkshire 
            Council Secondary School Public Private Partnership Proposal and East 
            Kilbride</strong>&#151;That the Parliament shares the concerns of 
            parents and pupils in East Kilbride regarding the public private partnership 
            secondary school proposal of South Lanarkshire Council which, if implemented, 
            would mean that 75% of resultant school closures will be in East Kilbride, 
            which will also lose 50% of its secondary schools resulting in school 
            rolls becoming amongst the highest in Scotland, and that the locations 
            of the proposed schools will entail considerably longer school journey 
            times for many pupils; notes that the council's financial proposal 
            is underpinned by the closure of St Bride's School, academically the 
            highest performing school in South Lanarkshire, so that its site can 
            be sold for development; further notes the concern of parents in East 
            Kilbride that the consultation process by the council is inadequate, 
            and calls on the council and the Minister for Finance and Public Services, 
            in consideration of the local community's deep-felt anxiety on this 
            issue, to reconsider this deeply flawed proposal.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-10#</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Scottish Agricultural 
            College</strong>&#151;That the Parliament views with concern the plans 
            by the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) board to move the college's 
            teaching and research services from Auchincruive, Ayrshire and Craibstone, 
            Aberdeen to Edinburgh; believes that there should be a full economic 
            impact assessment that takes into account the effect that this move 
            would have on students, staff and local communities before the proposal 
            is approved by the Scottish Executive; questions the methodology used 
            by the consultants in their review and report, and considers that 
            there should be a halt to the movement of staff from the SAC campuses 
            in Ayrshire and Aberdeen to Edinburgh, which runs contrary to the 
            Scottish Executive's policy of dispersing agency and department jobs 
            and offices outwith the central belt, until proper scrutiny is carried 
            out by the Parliament and its committees.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-9</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: Burns An' A' That Festival</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament compliments the Ayrshire "Burns An' A' That" Festival 
            steering committee and supporters for presenting a festival of Burns 
            in a way that not only induces considerable public acclaim and interest 
            but also underlines a real celebration of life and contemporary Scottish 
            culture.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-8</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: Future of the Scottish 
            Agricultural College</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">welcomes 
            the decision of the Scottish Agricultural College to consolidate its 
            main education and research facilities at King&#146;s Buildings and 
            the Bush Estate; notes that the decision is based on the major options 
            appraisal carried out by Deloitte and Touche to achieve the best configuration 
            of service delivery that is both operationally and financially sustainable 
            for the whole of Scotland; recognises the importance of maintaining 
            the existing advisory and consultancy services throughout Scotland, 
            and recognises the vital strategic importance of the decision to the 
            Scottish Executive's bioscience cluster strategy for the Lothians 
            and for Scotland.</a></p>
