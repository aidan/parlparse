          <p><strong>S1M-2184</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Contract Research 
            Staff</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that contract research 
            staff in Scotland&#146;s universities and research institutes are 
            one of the most significant assets in Scotland&#146;s knowledge economy; 
            notes that more than 90% of such staff are employed on insecure fixed 
            term contracts, resulting in a systematic failure to properly exploit 
            our science and social science base to the benefit of the Scottish 
            economy and society; further notes that this highly educated human 
            resource, comprising graduate, postgraduate and postdoctoral level 
            workers, is subject to constant wastage, to the detriment of Scotland&#146;s 
            universities and economic potential, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should act with clarity, urgency and determination to secure 
            a complete overhaul of the management of the contract research workforce 
            with a view to eliminating the current insecurity and wastage and 
            establishing a radical new approach in partnership with higher education 
            employers and representatives of the research staff. </p>
