                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5961 Rob Gibson: Investing in the Future of Scotland&rsquo;s Peatlands</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) UK Peatland Programme and Commission of Inquiry on Peatlands with funding from the Peter De Haan Charitable Trust and believes that IUCN UK&rsquo;s decision to base this prestigious programme in Scotland is recognition of the global significance of Scotland&rsquo;s peatlands and underlines that Scotland leads the world in peatland restoration expertise; considers that, while scientific understanding of peatlands is developing rapidly, the knowledge base is strong enough to recognise that peatlands deliver multiple benefits for biodiversity, water and climate and that the example of the Flow Country of Caithness and Sutherland shows how peatlands can deliver significant economic benefits to local communities through encouraging visitors to these beautiful and fragile landscapes; believes that the land use strategy required by the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 provides an opportunity for peatland restoration to be championed at the heart of government, and further believes that action taken now could prevent massive future costs arising from the breakdown of peatland ecosystems and that target-based peatland restoration offers an important opportunity to help meet Scotland&rsquo;s climate change targets.</p>

It will give strength to those who argue that Israel is not serious about peace&quot;, and hopes that all those interested in a peaceful resolution to the conflict will accept that the need for trust and goodwill as a precursor to meaningful discussions is a fundamental prerequisite.</p>

                                          Jackie Baillie: Pushed off the EDGE</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern that the Encouraging Dynamic Global Entrepreneurs (EDGE) programme has been cancelled; understands that EDGE is an innovative, international entrepreneurial programme that brings together students from leading Scottish universities, fifth-year school pupils in the Dumbarton constituency and in the rest of Scotland and students from international universities; further understands that the students form consultancy teams working on projects with Scottish businesses; considers that, in the four years that EDGE has been operating, it has equipped Scotland&rsquo;s pupils and students with an understanding about business needs; notes that EDGE has also helped businesses to grow and develop, with projected outcomes of &pound;24.6 million turnover, &pound;3 million profits and 264 jobs created; further considers that the benefit to young Scottish students at both high school and university level is invaluable, and would welcome discussion by all those involved to secure the future of the programme.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5958 Bob Doris: Congratulations to Summerston Youth Forum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the highly successful Summerston Youth Forum, which was established only in 2009 yet now attracts upwards of 80 children each week; notes that, due to the early success of the forum, the range of activities on offer will now have to be extended and hosted on two evenings per week and will have both junior and senior sections; praises the many volunteers who have given their time and energy to improving the lives of young children in Summerston and the surrounding area, and believes that the official launch of the Youth Forum on Tuesday 16 March 2010 is a welcome landmark for all involved.</p>
