<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4043</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Hibs Under-19s SFA Youth Cup Win</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Hibernian Football Club under-19s on their SFA Youth Cup win; notes that the final against Rangers was won by two goals to one; further notes the exciting game that went to extra time as both teams were drawn one each, and also congratulates Kurtus Byrne whose goal in the last minute of extra time gave Hibs its first taste of Youth Cup glory for 17 years.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4042</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>National Epilepsy Week 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the contribution made by Epilepsy Scotland and fellow Scottish members of the Joint Epilepsy Council of the UK and Ireland to raise awareness and combat the social stigma associated with epilepsy; supports these organisations in marking National Epilepsy Week, 17 to 23 May 2009, and in challenging discrimination and informing public attitudes; acknowledges that epilepsy should be higher on the Scottish Government<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s and NHS boards<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font> agendas so that more epilepsy specialist nurses and doctors can be trained and patient care can be improved; acknowledges Epilepsy Scotland<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s campaign for more nurses and a corresponding increase in specialist posts; calls on the Scottish Government and the NHS to ensure that sufficient epilepsy nurses work in each NHS board and to help them provide local transition arrangements for young people with epilepsy moving to adult epilepsy services; welcomes the Cross Party Group on Epilepsy<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s current review of social work section 23 assessments of need for families with epilepsy; congratulates the Scottish Parliament for winning Epilepsy Scotland<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s Employer of the Year Award, which recognises epilepsy best practice, and praises the ongoing awareness training provided for the Scottish Parliament<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s own staff so that epilepsy is no longer hidden and misunderstood.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4041&diams; </strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Time to End Sri Lankan War, Time for Humanitarian Concerns to Take a Priority</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the fact that the United Nations, European Union and other international institutions are calling for an immediate ceasefire in Sri Lanka between government forces and the Tamil Tigers; considers it vital that humanitarian assistance is able to reach the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who are suffering as a result of the conflict without adequate shelter, food and medicine; recognises that the Tamil community in Scotland, the vast majority of whom live in Glasgow, are desperately worried about relatives in the conflict zone with whom contact is restricted if existent at all; supports the international community in doing more to put pressure on both sides in the conflict to lay down arms and create humanitarian corridors for safe passage of aid; considers that the vast majority of people of Sri Lanka do not want this war, and believes that, after 26 years of brutal conflict and more than 70,000 deaths, it is now time for the voices of those people to be heard and for them to be able to live in peace.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4034</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Community Service Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the ongoing strike by community service workers in Glasgow, which remains unresolved after almost five months and which has led to Glasgow City Council failing in its statutory duty to implement community service orders; criticises Glasgow City Council for its refusal to seek independent arbitration to end the dispute and for the hardship and anxiety being suffered by the community service workers and their families; believes that Glasgow City Council<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s thinly veiled threat to outsource the work will only serve to further inflame the situation, and urges Glasgow City Council to enter into meaningful discussion with the workers through independent arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4032&diams; </strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Rights of Former Gurkha Soldiers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the victory for the rights of Gurkha soldiers achieved in the Commons defeat on 29 April 2009 when MPs voted by 267 to 246 for a Liberal Democrat motion offering all Gurkhas equal right of residence in Britain; believes that this is a historic victory for the Gurkhas who have served the United Kingdom so bravely; notes the widespread opposition to the UK Government<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s proposed guidelines, which are considered to permit only a small minority of Gurkhas and their families to settle while preventing the vast majority to do so; believes that the UK Government<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s decision fails to recognise the long history of dedicated service by Gurkha soldiers; welcomes the support for justice for the Gurkha soldiers by former Gurkha officer, Major Bill MacKay of Dunfermline; commends the 70 years of continuous service given by Sergeant Sunar Gurung, who served with Major MacKay, and Sergeant Gurung<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s six sons who all served with the Gurkha regiment, and believes that such service should be recognised.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4029</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>The Gurkhas, Prepared to Die for the UK but not Fit to Live Here?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees with the sentiments expressed in the Westminster Early Day Motion, EDM 1362, that states that new Home Office guidelines relating to the settlement of former Gurkha soldiers in the country for which they served is unnecessarily restrictive, morally wrong and offensive; notes that approximately 1,500 Gurkhas, including Falklands veterans, currently awaiting the outcome of their appeals would face deportation under the new guidelines; accordingly welcomes the UK Government<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s defeat in the House of Commons on this issue, and calls on the UK Government to take note of the majority opinion of MPs that it believes reflects the opinion of UK citizens and therefore to welcome those who are considered good enough to die for the United Kingdom as also fit to live here.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4027</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Pro-anorexia Websites</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is deeply concerned about the proliferation of pro-anorexia websites, which portray anorexia as a glamorous lifestyle choice rather than a potentially fatal psychiatric illness; acknowledges that such sites have been condemned by Beating Eating Disorders, the leading eating disorder charity in the United Kingdom; is aware that these sites share tips on how to accelerate weight loss and disguise fasting from concerned friends and family and advise on how best to induce vomiting and using laxatives; recognises that the appearance of pro-anorexia websites on social networking sites has allowed them to reach a much wider audience, aimed particularly at young women, and that they often pose as a means of support or claim that their intentions are neutral and support recovery while advocating an illness that can lead to infertility, heart disease and even death; understands that many people with anorexia go undiagnosed and up to 20% of those who become seriously ill die prematurely and are at particularly high risk of suicide, and calls on the UK Government to follow the example of the French Government in taking robust action against UK-based websites that actively promote harm and discourage vulnerable people with anorexia from seeking treatment by validating their behaviour, given that not all web portals are prepared to regulate these sites.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-4003*#*</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Supporting Our Local Newspaper Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Local Newspaper Week, 11 to 17 May 2009, and recognises the crucial role played by Scotland&rsquo;s local newspapers in providing a news service to their local communities; particularly notes the work of northern papers including <em>The Inverness Courier, Highland News, North Star, The Northern Scot, Ross-shire Journal and West Highland Free Press, </em>which serve, at times, a scattered and remote population; further notes the benefits to community engagement and the democratic process of the traditional local newspaper industry; acknowledges the increased pressures faced by the local newspaper industry due to falling circulation, loss of advertising revenue and increased competition from internet-based services, and considers that printed newspapers have served for centuries as a source of information on community affairs.</p>
<p>Supported by: Christina McKelvie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>S3M-3979*#*</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Local Newspaper Week 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 11 to 17 May 2009 is Local Newspaper Week, which has the theme of building stronger communities, highlighting the important roles played by the 120-plus weekly, bi-weekly, paid-for and free newspapers that serve local people and businesses throughout Scotland&rsquo;s cities, towns and villages; acknowledges the local press as Scotland&rsquo;s most socially inclusive local mass communication medium; applauds the significant investment made by publishers to deliver to an increasingly digital agenda and increase their digital audience; notes that members of the Scottish Newspaper Publishers Association are facing the most severe crisis in revenue generation and profitability in living memory, attributable to the long-term decline in paid-for newspaper circulations, the emergence of advertising-dependent internet services and the loss of recruitment advertising and licensing revenue to initiatives such as myjobscotland, developed under the auspices of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Local Government National Shared Services Board and led by COSLA, and is extremely concerned about the collateral damage to the democratic process and to the local newspaper industry that would result from the proposed introduction of a publicly funded web portal for the publication of public information notices.</p>
