          <p><EM>&#9;</em><STRONG>S2M-2117</STRONG> <STRONG>Nicol Stephen:</STRONG> <STRONG>Executive-Supported Lifeline Ferry Services in the Clyde and Hebrides</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s continued commitment to supporting and investing in lifeline ferry services in the Clyde and Hebrides; endorses its proposals for tendering the main bundle of ferry services as required under European Union rules, and welcomes the proposals for a final round of consultation to obtain the views of local communities and freight service users before proceeding with the tender under EU rules. </p>
          <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-2117.1</strong> <STRONG>Fergus Ewing: Executive-Supported Lifeline Ferry Services in the Clyde and Hebrides</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2117) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that lifeline ferry services must be provided and an element of public subsidy will be required for that aim; further believes that the proposed national concessionary travel scheme should be extended to ferry travel; calls on the Scottish Executive to provide documented evidence showing that EU law requires that the tendering process which the Executive proposes must be undertaken; is concerned about the potential impact that this process may have upon the employment conditions of staff working on ferries, and notes that many passengers have voiced serious concerns about both the efficiency and effectiveness of the current ferry services provided by Caledonian MacBrayne which require a thorough and independent investigation.&quot; </p>
          <p><STRONG>S2M-2117.2</strong> <STRONG>David Mundell: Executive-Supported Lifeline Ferry Services in the Clyde and Hebrides</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2117) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from &quot;commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the continued uncertainty inflicted upon Caledonian MacBrayne, its employees and customers as a result of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s handling of the tendering process; regrets that Clyde and Hebridean ferry services are going out to tender purely to satisfy the wishes of the European Commission, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put the interests of our island communities before those of the European Commission.&quot; </p>
