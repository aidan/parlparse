          <p><strong>*S1M-3766#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: British Cattle 
            Movement Service</strong>-That the Parliament notes the widespread 
            concern amongst the Scottish farming community in relation to the 
            operation of the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) and, in particular, 
            the volume of administrative errors and the delays by the BCMS in 
            dealing with correspondence; further notes that, as a result, the 
            operation of the service has contributed to financial hardship in 
            the farming sector at a time when farming incomes are already at desperately 
            low levels, and considers that the Scottish Executive's Environment 
            and Rural Affairs Department should institute an amnesty for all farmers 
            that have been alleged by the BCMS not to have accurately and timeously 
            supplied cattle record information and make representations to the 
            Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that a thorough 
            review of the operation of the BCMS should be instituted with a view 
            to eradicating the difficulties that have been identified.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3765#</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Removal of Thimerosal 
            in Vaccines</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that thirteen 
            vaccines currently available in the United Kingdom, including four 
            that are administered to children, contain thimerosal, a compound 
            50% comprised of ethyl mercury and already banned in the United States 
            of America; further notes the fears of a link between thimerosal and 
            conditions such as autism and Alzheimer's disease, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should take steps to eradicate thimerosal from 
            vaccines available in Scotland and, in the meantime, inform the public 
            about the availability of vaccines that do not contain thimerosal.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3764</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: Learndirect 
            Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament notes with pleasure the successful 
            growth in the number of learndirect Scotland centres in 2002 from 
            235 to 390 of which 185 are in socially excluded areas; congratulates 
            learndirect Scotland and its many partners on developing this valuable 
            new infrastructure that represents a major contribution to social 
            inclusion through widening access to learning skills and employability; 
            congratulates, in particular, Fife College of Further and Higher Education 
            on its exemplary commitment to extending access to learning, and notes 
            that the college is opening its eighth centre this month, making this 
            the largest number of centres to be established by any one organisation 
            in Scotland.</p>
