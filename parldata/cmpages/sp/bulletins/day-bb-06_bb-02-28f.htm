<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;
  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4024</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Regeneration in Scotland - People and Place</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s statement &quot;People and Place: Regeneration Policy in Scotland&quot;; notes the current support for the regeneration of communities across Scotland; supports the commitment from the Executive and its agencies to work with local authorities and other partners to ensure that communities benefit from economic activity and to attract further investment from the private sector, and welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s determination to tackle those land, property and other issues that can act as a barrier to regeneration and to create successful, mixed and vibrant communities.</p>
<p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4023</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>International Self Harm Awareness Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the work being done by health care professionals, social services, child protection services, the voluntary sector, LifeSIGNS, the National Self Harm Network, Samaritans, Childline and the &quot;See me&quot; campaign to combat the seriously high numbers of people who self harm every year; views with utmost concern the latest figures that indicate that one-in-10 people self harm, this figure being based only on the numbers who admit to causing themselves harm; calls on the Scottish Executive and all concerned organisations to recognise 1 March 2006 as self harm awareness day; calls for full support for all organisations in their efforts to address what is a very serious problem, and congratulates the Scottish Executive for the support it is presently giving to the &quot;See me&quot; campaign.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4022</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>The Draft Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exclusions and Exceptions) (Amendment) (Scotland) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Justice 2 Committee recommends that the draft Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exclusions and Exceptions) (Amendment) (Scotland) Order 2006 be approved.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4019</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Ingrid Betancourt and Other International Hostages</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with dismay the fourth anniversary of the abduction of Colombian Green Party leader, Ingrid Betancourt, and her colleague, Clara Rojas, by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the failure of the Government of Colombia to negotiate a humanitarian prisoner exchange; calls on the UK Government to join with the governments of France, Spain and Switzerland in brokering such an exchange; further notes the deteriorating human rights situation in Iraq where kidnap and extortion are now commonplace, as in Colombia, and where UK citizen and peace worker, Norman Kember, is still being held hostage; condemns the abduction of a UK citizen in the oil fields of Nigeria along with workers from Egypt, the Philippines, Thailand and the United States, and further calls on the UK Government to set an example to the international community by condemning the extrajudicial imprisonment of any person, whether by agents of the state or those who oppose them.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4018</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Labour Party&rsquo;s New Policy on Nuclear Power</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision taken by the Labour Party in Scotland at its Aviemore conference to support the building of new nuclear power stations in Scotland; further notes that this decision was taken in the run-up to the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster; believes the decision was taken as a result of pressure from UK Ministers in London to support nuclear power; further believes that, rather than opt for new nuclear power stations and a dangerous, dirty and expensive technology, Scotland should instead be doing everything possible to promote our nation as a centre of excellence for genuinely clean and safe energy technologies, and further believes that Labour&rsquo;s support for nuclear can only undermine efforts to turn Scotland into a renewables powerhouse.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4017#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Ship-to-Ship Oil Transfer</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the application by Forth Ports plc and Melbourne Marine Services to introduce ship-to-ship (STS) transfer of Russian heavy crude oil at swinging anchorage in the Firth of Forth; recognises the unprecedented scale and nature of such operations and the pollution risks posed by their routine operation and possible accidental spillage; notes the very recent identification by the UK Government of marine environment high risk areas around the Scottish coastline, and notably the Forth estuary, as being most sensitive and highly vulnerable to accidents involving merchant shipping and in need of protection; further notes that the Firth of Forth is a Special Protection Area containing numerous conservation sites of national and European importance, and a Ramsar site of international designation; acknowledges the devastating impact on the economy and ecology of areas, such as the Forth, that could occur in the event of a heavy crude oil spill; recognises the opposition to the Forth proposal by Fife Council, the City of Edinburgh Council, East Lothian Council, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, major environmental groups and agencies and local communities; expresses concern that any such proposal should be considered in the absence of either a UK or EU statutory regulatory framework for the control or monitoring of STS oil transfer operations along the Scottish coastline; notes that the current consultation by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency is not a full public consultation about the context or strategic merit of the Forth proposal, but is restricted to a discussion of Forth Ports&rsquo; oil spill contingency plan, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its powers, particularly under the EU Habitats Directive, to oppose the application for heavy oil transfer from ship to ship.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4016</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Scotland&rsquo;s Rugby Team - Calcutta Cup Winners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament sends its congratulations to the Scottish Rugby team in winning the Calcutta Cup by 18-12 against England; believes that this result, together with the win against France, demonstrates the significant progress that Frank Hadden and his team of players have made in recent months, and wishes them every success in their matches against Ireland and Italy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4015#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>International Women&rsquo;s Day - Shaping a Fairer Future</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the many events being organised throughout the world to mark International Women&rsquo;s Day on 8 March 2006; notes the report of the Women and Work Commission, <em>Shaping a Fairer Future</em>, and that, while over thirty years have elapsed since the Sex Discrimination Act was passed, the Equal Pay Act came into force and the Equal Opportunities Commission was established, the commission reports that the gender pay gap is the worst in the European Union; further notes that women remain significantly under-represented, particularly at the top of many professions, in business, in the public sector and in many areas of civic participation, including our democratic institutions; welcomes the forthcoming introduction of the public sector gender equality duty; believes that it is incumbent on all political parties to address the under-representation of women in politics, and believes that the Scottish Executive should promote flexible, family-friendly working and consider ways in which the gender equality duty can be implemented throughout Scottish society.</p>
