    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-940</b> <strong>Trish Godman: Use of Mobile Phones on Trains</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament deplores the willingness with which many mobile phone users on trains
    divulge intimate details of their domestic and business affairs to their fellow
    passengers; notes the increase in the frequency of mobile phone use on trains and the
    constant inconvenience to non-phone using passengers, and calls upon the rail operators to
    designate phone free zones on all trains.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-939</b> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Animal Welfare and the Scottish Society
    for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses concern at
    the serious allegations raised by reputable organisations and individuals in relation to
    animal welfare and the activities of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
    Animals; notes the highlighting of these serious concerns by the <i>Sunday Mail</i>
    newspaper, and believes that a full public inquiry into these allegations is required to
    ensure the highest possible quality and standard of care is being delivered to animals in
    care throughout Scotland.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-938</b> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Expenditure on Beach and Coastal
    Maintenance</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that only three of Scotland&#146;s beaches
    have won the European blue flag award; further notes that a mere £0.6 million has been
    spent by the Scottish Executive on the upkeep of Scotland&#146;s coastline, and that
    Scotland&#146;s councils have spent considerably more than this on coastal protection and
    maintenance, despite severe financial constraints; believes that current expenditure
    levels are insufficient to ensure that more Scottish beaches reach the blue flag standard,
    and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to reconsider budget allocations with a
    view to ensuring that local authorities can bring more of Scotland&#146;s beaches up to
    standard.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-937#</b> <strong>Alex Fergusson: Galloway Food Producers Outlet</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the success of the first Galloway Food Festival held in Wigtown on 27
    May 2000; further notes the proposal which emerged from that festival to establish a local
    food producers&#146; retail outlet at Gretna, and believes that the Scottish Executive
    should assist in the initial funding of such an outlet through its pilot project, recently
    established with organisations and producers in Dumfries and Galloway, to look at
    developing viable markets for locally produced goods, as referred to in the answer to
    parliamentary question S1W-6139.<b><i> R</p>
    </i><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-936</b> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Top Award for Fife Beaches</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament congratulates the Kingdom of Fife on providing all three of the Scottish
    beaches, at Silver Sands, Aberdour, West Sands, St Andrews and Elie beach, which have been
    awarded the European Blue Flag, in recognition of their clean water and beach management
    standards.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-935 Mr John Swinney on behalf of the Enterprise and Lifelong
    Learning Committee: Local Economic Development Services Inquiry</b>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes the 1<sup>st</sup> Report 2000 of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning
    Committee on local economic development services (SP Paper 109) and commends the
    conclusions to the Scottish Executive in the context of its current review of economic
    development structures. </p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">*S1M-934</b> <strong>Irene McGugan: The New Testament in Scots</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament acknowledges that in translating the New Testament into Scots, William L
    Lorimer undertook the challenging project of recreating Scots prose and scrutinised
    upwards of 180 translations in more than 20 languages; notes that his work demonstrates
    the range, vigour and vitality of which Scots prose is capable, and is not only a
    remarkable translation but a considerable accomplishment and a notable contribution to our
    literary and linguistic heritage, and commends Canongate Books for reprinting this
    publication after 14 years, by popular demand.</p>
