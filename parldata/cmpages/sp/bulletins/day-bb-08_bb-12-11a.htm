<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Business: ScotRail Franchise&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3075</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>ScotRail Franchise</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Audit Scotland report on the extension of First ScotRail&rsquo;s contract to 2014; expresses serious concern regarding the lack of consultation over the extension of this franchise and the failure of ministers to require a fully documented business case; notes the resignation of the former finance director of Transport Scotland; calls on the Scottish Government to cooperate with any Audit Committee investigation, and urges the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change to issue a statement to the Parliament should any investigation into the probity or governance within Transport Scotland make that necessary. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3075.3</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson: ScotRail Franchise</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3075) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to first &quot;Transport Scotland&quot;. </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-3075.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: ScotRail Franchise</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3075) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes from the report that the original contract, negotiated by the previous Labour-led Scottish administration, &quot;did not specify the conditions under which an extension should be considered or the criteria to be used to decide whether an extension might be appropriate&quot;; believes that practice and procedures for future contract management can be improved and notes the report&rsquo;s recommendations for Transport Scotland; considers that, in light of the finding that &quot;First ScotRail was performing above its punctuality and capacity improvements targets within its first year of operating&quot; and &quot;key aspects of the original franchise contract were no longer fit for purpose&quot;, the decision to extend the contract, inserted into the original contract under the previous Labour-led Scottish administration, was on balance justifiable.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-3075.2</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes: ScotRail Franchise</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3075) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end &quot;requires the Scottish Government to conduct the next steps of the franchise extension process with the greatest possible transparency, and therefore calls on the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change to bring before Parliament the draft proposals on how the &pound;73.1 million accrued through the franchise extension will be reinvested to allow close scrutiny of the plans before any further funds are committed.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Labour Party Business: Kinship Care&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-3078</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Kinship Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the commitment given by the First Minister on 27 September 2007 to provide allowances for kinship carers and ensure that funding would be brought forward to ensure that all kinship carers of looked-after children in Scotland were paid the recommended allowance for foster carers; further notes the commitment contained in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategy, Getting it right for every child in kinship and foster care, to introduce a minimum national allowance of between &pound;119 and &pound;198 per week for kinship carers and the comments of the Minister for Children and Early Years in the subsequent debate on 5 December 2007 that he anticipated that payment of this allowance would begin in April 2008; is concerned that this has not materialised and that the vast majority of kinship carers are not in receipt of an allowance consistent with the promises made by both the Minister for Children and Early Years and the First Minister, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to honour in full its pledge to Scotland&rsquo;s kinship carers and to properly recognise the vital role that kinship carers play in looking after some of Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable children. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-3078.1</strong> <strong>Adam Ingram: Kinship Care</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3078) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;to provide&quot; to end and insert &quot;to kinship carers; notes the increase of over 100% of looked-after children since 2000 who live with a kinship carer; recognises the crucial role that these carers play in supporting our most vulnerable children and that they should be supported financially at an equivalent level to foster carers; welcomes work by local authorities towards providing financial support to approved kinship carers of looked-after children using resources provided by central government and further welcomes the work of COSLA and the Association of Directors of Social Work to support the efforts of all local authorities to achieve this; calls on the Scottish Government to work constructively with the UK Government to resolve issues arising out of the interface with United Kingdom benefits legislation, and in this context notes the willingness of United Kingdom ministers to address anomalies in benefits entitlement for kinship carers.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>11.40 am</strong>&#9;General Question Time&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>1. Bill Wilson:</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make representations at European level in favour of extending to the Scots language the provisions of Part III of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages that apply to the Welsh, Gaelic and Irish languages.
