         <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2464</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> <strong>Fire (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that during Stage 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time-limits indicated (each time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when the meeting of the Parliament is suspended or otherwise not in progress):</p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2463</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Identity Cards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Identity Cards Bill currently being considered by the Westminster Parliament; is concerned at the lack of time devoted to the scrutiny of this Bill, which has left important questions unanswered over how the identity card scheme will work in practice; believes the proposals to be flawed on political, technical and financial grounds; is concerned that the national identity card and database offer an ineffective response to problems of security and fraud and pose an unacceptable threat to civil liberties; notes that the current cost estimate for the scheme is &pound;5.5 billion and that further escalation of this cost is expected; rejects the Prime Minister&rsquo;s belief, stated on 1 December 2004 in the House of Commons, that &quot;it is legitimate and right, in this day and age, to ask people to carry identity cards&quot; which appears to go far beyond the current scope of the Bill and would require the consent of the Scottish Parliament; welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s position that identity cards will not be required to allow access to devolved public services, and calls on the Executive to make a full statement on the intended use of the identity database by devolved institutions.</p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2462</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Towards an Energy Efficiency Strategy in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that energy efficiency has great potential to improve efforts to tackle climate change and fuel poverty and to improve quality of life; agrees that energy efficiency has a key part to play in meeting the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s target of eradicating fuel poverty in Scotland by 2016; further agrees that more than half the emissions reductions in the United Kingdom&rsquo;s climate change programme could come from energy efficiency, as stated in the UK Energy White Paper, and commends the Executive for its current initiatives to improve energy efficiency and for its move towards a national strategic approach to energy efficiency as outlined in its climate change consultation.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2461</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Top Marks for East Renfrewshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates East Renfrewshire Council and its Education Department on the outstanding report it has received from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education; notes that in every single category of inspection the authority was given the highest rating of &quot;very good&quot;; recognises that this assessment and praise is a reflection of the level of service the department provides to schools and their staff and to pupils and their parents in East Renfrewshire; acknowledges the success the authority has had, measured not only in the achievements of its pupils, but in its support for inclusion and the ethos it has developed in its schools, and highlights the need for the Scottish Executive to continue to provide support to the local authority so that it can build on this success to help all young people in East Renfrewshire develop to their full potential.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2460</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Eurosource (Falkirk) Quality Scotland Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the recycling group, Eurosource, based in Falkirk, on winning the Corporate Citizenship award at Quality Scotland&rsquo;s recent &quot;Scottish Awards for Business Excellence&quot; ceremony and welcomes the organisation&rsquo;s success and its contribution to the fundraising activities of a number of Scotland&rsquo;s charities, its commitment to community involvement and the useful work that it does in reducing the amount of waste going to landfill in Scotland.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2459</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie on behalf of the Edinburgh Tram (Line One) Bill Committee:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Tram (Line One) Bill - Preliminary Stage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Edinburgh Tram (Line One) Bill and that the Bill should proceed as a Private Bill.</p>
         <p>Supported by: Phil Gallie<strong>*</strong></p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2458</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Newlands Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the parents and community in winning a stay of execution on the proposal to close Newlands Primary School in the Scottish Borders; notes the determined and professional campaign mounted to prevent closure against the wishes of the community; has concerns that the closure proposal is conditional on the parents and wider community raising &pound;1 million to keep the school open when taxation and council taxes have already been paid for this purpose; considers that this may establish an unhealthy precedent which may require communities elsewhere in the Borders to seek a similar solution to proposed closure; notes that Highland Council has a policy of non-closure of small primary schools if it is opposed by the community, and urges the Scottish Executive, which has undertaken to put schools &quot;at the heart of the community&quot;, to provide additional funding to cash-strapped rural councils for the sole purpose of keeping their small but essential local primary schools open.</p>
