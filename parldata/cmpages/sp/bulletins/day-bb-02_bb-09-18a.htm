          <p><strong>S1M-3191</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan:</strong> <strong>Dundee 
            Heritage Trust</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that our industrial 
            heritage is of interest to many people from other countries as well 
            as Scots; notes with concern, however, that despite strenuous efforts 
            and exploration of all possible funding opportunities, Dundee Heritage 
            Trust, the charity which owns Dundee's leading tourist attractions, 
            RRS Discovery and the Verdant Works, has been forced by a continuing 
            and critical shortfall in revenue support into a series of cost-cutting 
            exercises and staff redundancies, the latest being the loss of their 
            very experienced and committed chief executive; recognises that the 
            seriousness of this move cannot be underestimated and is a worrying 
            indication that the closure of both Discovery Point and the Verdant 
            Works may now be imminent; considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            put in place a financial package with immediate effect and extend 
            central revenue support as part of a longer term strategy to secure 
            the future of these significant visitor attractions, both of which 
            achieved five star grading by VisitScotland, with Dundee Heritage 
            Trust being the only independent operator in Scotland to achieve this 
            accolade, and notes that the loss of RRS Discovery, which gives the 
            city of Dundee its "identity" and the Verdant Works, the last working 
            jute mill in Scotland and European Industrial Museum of the Year in 
            1999, to the cultural heritage of the nation would be both significant 
            and irreplaceable. </p>
