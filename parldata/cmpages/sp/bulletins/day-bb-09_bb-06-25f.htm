<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4511</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>West Lothian Council Rent Increases</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the decision of SNP-led West Lothian Council to increase rents for new-build council houses in West Lothian by 10%, which is on top of an existing 20% increase over four years in council rents imposed by the SNP-led council in 2007; considers that this decision will create an unfair two-tier rent structure for council housing in West Lothian and means that a tenant renting a three bedroom house in one street will pay &pound;51.35 per week whereas a tenant renting a similar sized new-build property in the next will pay &pound;74.80, a difference of &pound;23.45 each week; further considers this reprehensible decision to be grossly unfair; recognises that it will put hard-pressed families under greater economic pressure, and welcomes the statement from West Lothian Council Labour group opposing this disgraceful rent hike.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4510</strong> <strong>Ian McKee:</strong> <strong>Genius Bread</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh&rsquo;s Lucinda Bruce-Gardyne, the creator of Genius, the first ever fresh gluten and wheat-free bread available in stores, and United Central Bakeries Ltd of Bathgate for producing it; notes that the product has won several innovation awards, including Best Free From Award 2009; further notes that, according to medical research, one in 100 people has coeliac disease and an even greater number of people experience some degree of wheat or gluten intolerance; understands that Genius is an alternative to traditional wheat bread that is high in fibre and low in carbohydrates, protein and sugars in comparison to traditional breads; considers that this product will allow people who lead gluten-free lifestyles, either for medical reasons or dietary choices, the possibility to introduce fresh bread into their diets, and hopes that the product will soon become available in all supermarkets and local shops across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4509</strong> <strong>Christopher Harvie:</strong> <strong>Job Losses at MGt, Kirkcaldy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by MGt, based in Kirkcaldy, the billing and software provider to the sports broadcaster Setanta, that it will lay off 10% of its workforce, resulting in the loss of 100 jobs, in order to cut costs in the wake of Setanta going into administration in the United Kingdom; deplores the fact that the economic recession is putting outsourced support and software centre employees in a highly vulnerable position; calls on the management of MGt to give full consideration, during the 30-day consultation period, to other means of cutting costs, such as management salaries, to reduce the planned number of redundancies; asks MGt to work with the Scottish Government and other public bodies to ensure that every assistance is offered to the workers and families affected, and also calls for management and workers&rsquo; representatives to consider an appeal to top-class premier league players, who might be well disposed and well placed to offer support to fans and workers, on the bottom rung of their industry, threatened with redundancy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4508</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Helensburgh and Lomond Highland Heatwave</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Helensburgh and Lomond Highland Games Committee on its second successful games on 14 June 2009; commends the chairperson, Sephton MacQuire, and all the volunteers for their efforts; welcomes the contribution of &pound;8,750 from the Lottery Awards for All programme; further welcomes the contribution of the Helensburgh and District Pipe Band, Strathclyde Fire and Rescue Pipe Band and clan chieftain Iain MacAulay in opening proceedings; congratulates all those involved in the heavyweight events, highland dancing and youth trail race, and notes the high turnout of spectators both local and national to enjoy the Helensburgh and Lomond Highland Games in a glorious heatwave.</p>
