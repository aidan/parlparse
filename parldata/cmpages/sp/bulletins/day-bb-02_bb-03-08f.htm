          <p><strong>*S1M-2862 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau: 
            Deputy Convenership of Committees</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees 
            that the deputy Convener of the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner 
            Bill Committee be appointed from the Labour Party. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2861</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: School Repairs Fund</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes the considerable outstanding repair bill faced 
            by Scottish schools; notes that in some cases schools have been allowed 
            to fall into an unacceptable state of disrepair, simply because local 
            authorities cannot afford the necessary investment for improvement; 
            draws attention to Greenhill Primary School in Coatbridge as an example 
            of a school whose major repair requirements have provoked a crisis, 
            and calls on the Executive to provide an emergency fund so that councils 
            are able to bring schools up to a decent standard so that our children 
            are taught in safe and comfortable surroundings.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2860</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Henry McLeish's Constituency 
            Office</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the press reports 
            on the latest revelations concerning Henry McLeish&#146;s constituency 
            office; calls for a full publication by Fife Council of their report 
            and for an independent inquiry into this scandal; further calls for 
            the resignation of Henry McLeish as an MSP while he draws a high pension 
            of £34,000 a year for 13 months&#146; work as First Minister, and 
            calls for an investigation into the awarding of this pension while 
            hundreds of thousands of pensioners barely survive on less than £10,000 
            per year after a lifetime of work.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2859</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Eurostar: A Return for our Money</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes with disappointment the Strategic Rail Authority&#146;s 
            failure to secure a link from Scotland to the continent within its 
            current ten year plan, despite a Court of Session ruling three years 
            ago, and calls on the Executive to support Strathclyde Passenger Transport 
            in securing this link as soon as possible to pass on some of the benefit 
            currently enjoyed by the south east of England, particularly considering 
            that Scotland has paid its fair share toward this project but has 
            received no benefit in return.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2858</strong> <strong>John Scott: Ayr Scottish Eagles</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates the players, staff and supporters of 
            Ayr Scottish Eagles, Scotland&#146;s only superleague ice hockey team, 
            on their victory in the Blue Square.com Challenge cup final; further 
            congratulates the team on its second place finish in the Sekonda Ice 
            Hockey Superleague and resultant qualification for European competition 
            next season and wishes the team every success in the forthcoming play-off 
            competition; recognises the popularity of ice hockey as a spectator 
            sport in Scotland, and calls on SportScotland to afford a higher priority 
            to the sport in order that clubs may develop the wealth of young talent 
            in the country with a view to participation in future Winter Olympic 
            Games.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Brian Monteith<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2857#</strong> <strong>John Scott: Importation of Putrescible Waste 
            to Scottish Landfill Sites</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the rights of landfill site operators to use their sites as licensed, 
            but nonetheless notes with concern the intention of some local authorities 
            in Northern Ireland to use Scottish landfill sites for dumping their 
            putrescible waste, and further recognises that in the long term this 
            is likely to impact adversely on Scottish council tax payers, as Scottish 
            landfill resources are used up by non-Scottish local authorities using 
            Scotland as their dumping ground.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2856</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: Don't Kill Safiyat Hussain</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament calls for the quashing of the death sentence by stoning 
            passed by a Shariah Court in Gwadabawa, Sokoto State, Nigeria on Mrs 
            Safiyat Hussain, a 35-year-old woman and nursing mother, for allegedly 
            committing adultery; notes that this decision will be appealed on 
            18 March 2002 and that Safiyat Hussain&#146;s defence is that she 
            was raped by a man in her village, that he was acquitted as there 
            was no witnesses to the alleged assault, yet she was found guilty 
            as she was pregnant; believes that Safiyat Hussain should be freed, 
            and calls for her immediate acquittal and freedom.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Adam Ingram<strong>*</strong>, Mr Lloyd Quinan<strong>*</strong>, Tommy 
            Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2855</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Freedom of Information (Scotland) 
            Bill - Stage 3</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that the Freedom 
            of Information (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Dr Richard Simpson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2854</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie: Ayr United Football Club</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that there is no truth in the suggestion that 
            Ayr United Football Club has taken up a lease of Hampden Park given 
            the amount of time spent there these days and urges the Scottish Executive 
            to make a swift and positive decision on the Ayr United football stadium 
            planning application so that Ayr can compete for a place in the Scottish 
            Premier League.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2844#</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Scottish Sub-Post Offices - "Your 
            Guide"</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">acknowledges 
            the importance of the role that sub-post offices play in Scottish 
            communities, particularly in rural areas and deprived urban areas; 
            recognises the potential financial consequences for sub-post offices 
            in Scotland of the UK-wide Automated Credit Transfer system for the 
            payment of benefits; notes that &quot;Your Guide&quot; is a comprehensive 
            information service currently being evaluated for sub-post offices 
            in England and Wales; further notes that such a service includes Government 
            General Practitioner and Internet Learning Access Point initiatives, 
            both of which provide members of the public with the ability to interact 
            with departments of Her Majesty&#146;s Government and gain government 
            information in an accessible way; further recognises the potential 
            benefits that such a service could provide in Scotland, in terms of 
            improving openness and public participation with government, as well 
            as potentially providing a timely boost to business levels for sub-post 
            offices at a time when the network is having difficulty in sustaining 
            such levels, and *considers that* the Scottish Executive *should* 
            pilot such a scheme in Scotland, with a view to rolling out the service 
            across the country as soon as possible. </a></p>
