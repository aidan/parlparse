          <p><strong>*S2M-1511</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>The 
            Crisis in Darfur</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its concern 
            about the crisis in Darfur, Sudan; believes that the principle of 
            non-refoulement as enshrined in refugee law should be respected with 
            regard to refugees in Chad and that the same principle should be applied 
            with regard to people displaced internally; urges the international 
            community to provide financial and in-kind support for humanitarian 
            appeals for Darfur and refugees in Chad; supports the African Union 
            (AU) in calling for the immediate establishment of the ceasefire commission 
            and of protection units that were requested in the 8 April 2004 agreement 
            between the Darfur rebels and the Sudan government and for the deployment 
            of adequate numbers of AU ceasefire monitors and the facilitation 
            of their free movement throughout the region, and calls on Her Majesty's 
            Government and the international community to use their influence 
            to ensure that the recently agreed north-south peace accord is implemented 
            effectively.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1510#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Argyll 
            and Clyde Clinical Review</strong>-That the Parliament rejects the 
            NHS Argyll and Clyde consultation on its clinical review; believes 
            that this consultation is flawed from the outset as it neither consults 
            the people who live in Argyll and Clyde, nor those who use the NHS, 
            about what kind of services they need; notes that the consultation 
            announces a raft of severe cuts and then has the audacity to attempt 
            to consult people on which services they would like to see cut, and 
            considers that the proposals for cuts in this consultation should 
            be rejected outright and, furthermore, that NHS Argyll and Clyde should 
            withdraw this consultation and begin a new consultation with the people 
            they serve on what kind of NHS is needed for the 21st century.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1509</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Association for Mental Health - One in Four Music Campaign</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Association for Mental Health 
            for its excellent music CD entitled <em>One in Four </em>which aims 
            to raise awareness of mental health issues amongst young people; believes 
            that music is a powerful vehicle for awareness raising and change; 
            welcomes the support of the Scottish Executive National Programme 
            for Improving Mental Health and Wellbeing to produce some 14,000 CDs 
            which were distributed to young people during the Ten Days in May 
            music festival in Glasgow last month, and applauds the donation of 
            tracks free of charge from bands including Teenage Fanclub, Multiplies, 
            Snow Patrol, The Delgados, Future Pilot A.K.A., Mogwai, Arab Strap, 
            James Orr Complex, Belle and Sebastian, Eugene Kelly, Uncle John &amp; 
            Whitelock, Vera Cruise, Park Attack and Macrocosmica.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1508</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 
            - Intelligent Community of the Year</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the achievement by the City of Glasgow in being named as the world's 
            Intelligent Community of the Year and offers its congratulations to 
            all involved in the achievement of this prestigious award in the face 
            of significant world-wide competition.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1507</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 
            Metropolitan College</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the ministerial 
            approval given on 11 June 2004 for a merger between Glasgow College 
            of Building and Printing and Glasgow College of Food Technology to 
            create a new single college of further education to be named Glasgow 
            Metropolitan College with effect from 1 August 2004; agrees that both 
            colleges have an excellent reputation in their field, and considers 
            that the merger will benefit 14,000 students as its aim is to boost 
            the quality of educational provision at the adjacent sites in the 
            city centre of Glasgow.<strong><em> R</em></strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1506</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Senior 
            Citizens' Views of Pension Credit</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the first study by Age Concern that is aimed at examining the experiences 
            of senior citizens applying for, and receiving, pension credit; acknowledges 
            that the research shows that nine out of 10 pensioners receiving pension 
            credit believe that Her Majesty's Government should provide a higher 
            basic state pension; believes that a decent and fair income for senior 
            citizens is their right and should replace the complicated, excluding 
            and stigmatising benefits system, as 73% of pensioners in the study 
            believe means-testing puts them off applying for pension credit; further 
            agrees that means-testing is inefficient as the cost of administering 
            pension credit is greater than what is actually being received by 
            senior citizens, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to 
            exert more influence on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to provide 
            a fair, basic state pension and to deliver on his 1993 pledge to remove 
            means-testing if elected to government.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1505</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Stromness Academy</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 
            18 teams of young people who took part in the Young Enterprise Scotland 
            national finals in Edinburgh on 16 June 2004 after qualifying in their 
            regional finals earlier this year and particularly congratulates the 
            team from Stromness Academy, Orkney, which was the overall award winner 
            with its business, Orkney Ink.</P>
