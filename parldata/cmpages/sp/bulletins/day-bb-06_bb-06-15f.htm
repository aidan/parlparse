<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4553</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>No VAT on the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to lobby the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ensure that none of the costs of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route incur Value Added Tax.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4537*#*</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Learning Disability Week 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates ENABLE Scotland on commissioning research undertaken by the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability; notes that the research on the impact of &quot;The same as you?&quot;, the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s seminal policy framework on services for the people with learning disabilities and family carers, has been published to mark Learning Disability Week which takes place between 18 and 25 June 2006; believes that it demonstrates the tremendous difference made to the lives of people with learning disabilities by the implementation of &quot;The same as you?&quot; including new services, such as local area co-ordinators in West Dunbartonshire; considers that there has been a qualitative transformation in the lives of many people with learning disabilities; acknowledges that the survey recognises the positive impact that &quot;The same as you?&quot; has made on those who have benefited from it; notes that not all people have seen positive changes in their lives; considers that the policy needs to be driven at a local and national level, and encourages the Scottish Executive to ensure that all children and adults with learning disabilities in Scotland can benefit.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4525*#*</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>National Bed Assessment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde now has responsibility for a population of approximately one million; considers, therefore, that an urgent assessment is required of all numbers of beds, including high dependency and intensive care beds and those set aside for barrier nursing, since availability of every type of bed is crucial to the best clinical decisions and nursing care, as well as to the smooth and easy flow of the patient journey from one area of a hospital to another as their medical condition changes for better or worse; recognises that not having appropriate beds of any kind, in any speciality at any one time, can mean that a patient may have to stay in intensive care longer than necessary and thus block a bed for a patient who should be transferred from a high-dependency bed or theatre to an intensive care unit bed; acknowledges that delays to admission from casualty, accident and emergency or trauma departments may also be due to a lack of all types of beds being available, thus resulting in the discharge of patients in the evening in order to free a bed for an emergency admission; recognises that important elective procedures and operations may have to be cancelled at short notice as a result of no appropriate bed being available because of a general bed shortage, and therefore, in light of an increasingly ageing population with more complex conditions and in anticipation of a further rise of medical admissions including all types of infections, in particular MRSA, winter and summer vomiting viruses which often close wards, considers that work should be done to address our present problems within such a large NHS board and as a result decrease waiting times and lists.</p>
