<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4023</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Substitution on Committees</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Jackie Baillie be appointed to replace Johann Lamont as the Scottish Labour Party substitute on the Equal Opportunities Committee.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4021</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>European Parliament&rsquo;s Civil Liberties Committee&rsquo;s Recognition of the Right to be Educated in and Communicate in BSL</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the desire of the European Parliament&rsquo;s Civil Liberties Committee to promote regional or minority languages and specifically the statement that it believes that &quot;the right to speak and to be educated in one&rsquo;s mother tongue is one of the most basic fundamental rights&quot; and accordingly expresses the opinion that failure to provide education in British Sign Language (BSL) to deaf children and to provide targeted funding and specific programmes for the promotion of BSL is considered a breach of human rights.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4020</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Scottish Maritime Museum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the significance of exhibits held at the Scottish Maritime Museum in Irvine; welcomes the news that the Imperial War Museum has requested two items from its collection to form part of an exhibition marking the 70th anniversary of the start of the second world war; notes that the pieces come from the liner SS Athenia, the first British ship sunk in the second world war, having been torpedoed approximately 200 miles out in the Atlantic on Sunday 3 September 1939, within a few hours of war being declared; acknowledges that collections such as this are invaluable to the nation&rsquo;s cultural heritage, further enhancing the role of Scottish museums around the world; commends the ongoing work of the Scottish Maritime Museum in Irvine, along with Scotland&rsquo;s other industrial museums, and therefore agrees that it is in the nation&rsquo;s interest that these museums are protected and assured of a secure future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4019</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Kelly Street Children&rsquo;s Centre, Greenock</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Kelly Street Children&rsquo;s Centre, Greenock, for the excellent HM Inspectorate of Education report that it received; notes that Kelly Street Children&rsquo;s Centre received two excellent and three very good evaluation ratings; further notes that the centre was praised for having highly motivated confident learners throughout and a high quality curriculum; acknowledges this excellent report; wishes all those involved in the centre the very best for the future, and hopes that they keep up the good work.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4018</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Breastfeeding, Every Day Makes a Difference to Your Baby</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that National Breastfeeding Awareness Week takes place from 10 to 16 May 2009, with this year&rsquo;s theme being &quot;Breastfeeding: every day makes a difference to your baby&quot;; recognises the positive impact of breastfeeding on the health of both mother and child; understands that mums who receive help and support, whether it be from a friend or family member, a healthcare professional or volunteer breastfeeding supporter, are likely to breastfeed for longer, giving them and their child important health benefits; believes that the Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005 is an excellent method of protecting the child&rsquo;s right to be breastfed in public places, free from harassment, and thus acts as a positive incentive for choosing breastfeeding; is concerned, however, that anecdotal evidence suggests that attempts are still being made to stop mothers and babies from breastfeeding in public places despite this being a criminal offence; regrets the apparent lack of knowledge of the law on breastfeeding in society as a whole but specifically within the police forces of Scotland; considers that knowledge within the Scottish Police Service could be improved if the Act were to feature as part of the syllabus taught to probationer constables; expects that, where evidence exists to show that the law has been broken, such cases will be referred to the procurator fiscal, and believes that the Scottish Government should take urgent action to ensure that this law is understood by employers, law enforcers and the general public as part of an awareness raising campaign to assist in meeting its target of 37.5% of babies being exclusively breastfed by 2010-11.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4017&diams;</strong> <strong>Jim Tolson:</strong> <strong>Settlement for Former Gurkha Soldiers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the UK Government&rsquo;s announcement of new guidelines for the settlement for former Gurkha soldiers, which limits applications for settlement to former soldiers who have served for 20 years or more or who have been awarded the highest military honours; acknowledges the support for the settlement of former Gurkha soldiers by former Gurkha officer, Major Bill MacKay of Dunfermline; further acknowledges over 70 years continuous service given by Sergeant Sunar Gurung, who served with Major Bill MacKay, and his six sons who all served with the Gurkha regiment, and believes that the UK Government&rsquo;s decision fails to recognise the long history of dedicated service to this country by Gurkha soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4016</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Sustrans School Travel Survey</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch by Sustrans of the results of the first ever Scottish national survey into school travel; welcomes the fact that more children now travel to school by active travel methods such as walking, cycling and scooter than those who travel by car, bus or taxi; further welcomes the fact that the number of children cycling and walking to school has been found to be higher than previously expected; recognises the importance of active travel to school in combating traffic congestion, air pollution and childhood obesity; congratulates Sustrans on the success of its Tackling the School Run programme of projects with 103 schools across Scotland, which has doubled on average the use of cycling and walking routes around project schools, enabled 135,690 more cycling and walking trips to school and has ensured that 30,929 young Scots now have access to safer walking and cycling routes to school, and calls on the Scottish Government to commit additional resources to support and promote active and sustainable travel to school for those many young people who do not yet have access to safe routes.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-4014</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Turner Prize Nominations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Lucy Skaer and Richard Wright on being shortlisted for the prestigious contemporary art award, the Turner Prize; believes that the nomination of both artists, who studied at Glasgow School of Art, demonstrates the continuing high standard of Scotland&rsquo;s artistic education alongside world-class appeal for Scotland&rsquo;s </p>
<p>art community, and wishes both artists every success in the competition.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4008</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Epilepsy Scotland&rsquo;s Employer of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the winners of Epilepsy Scotland&rsquo;s employer of the year awards, Russell Hamilton Business Systems Limited and the Scottish Parliament itself; notes the excellent example that these and the other short-listed employers have shown in catering for staff with epilepsy, and encourages more businesses and organisations across Scotland to support both current and potential employees and work towards achieving a Best Practice Certificate from Epilepsy Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4007.1.1</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-4007.1) in the name of Keith Brown, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward detailed proposals by the start of the 2009-10 academic year as to how it will implement amendment S3M-3164.1, which recognised the need for the Scottish Government to ensure that pupils in Scotland are properly tested in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy by the end of primary 7 and which was given unanimous support by the Parliament on 7 January 2009.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4007.2</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4007) in the name of Margaret Smith, after &quot;remains high&quot; insert &quot;; deeply regrets that the SNP government&rsquo;s response to the reduction in full-time teaching posts has been to cut teacher training places by 18% despite its pledges to maintain teacher numbers and reduce class sizes&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4006.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>The Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4006) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from &quot;notes that current&quot; to end and insert &quot;and calls on the Scottish Government to report back to the Parliament on the extent to which a fuel duty derogation for rural areas would be permissible under EU law and what impact such a derogation would have on carbon emissions and the Scottish budget.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4004.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>Budget Implications for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4004) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;; notes the research by the Centre for Public Policy for Regions (CPPR) that predicts that in real terms the Scottish Government Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) will be between &pound;2.1 billion and &pound;3.8 billion lower in 2013-14 than in 2009-10; further notes the comments of John McLaren of CPPR that &quot;the prospects beyond 2013-14 are also not good and although positive real terms growth rates are likely to return, they are unlikely to be very large until UK net debt as a share of GDP falls, possibly not until the 2030s&quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to prepare contingency plans on how such changes to the Scottish DEL will be managed.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4004.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Budget Implications for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4004) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;; agrees that the temporary cut in VAT has proved costly and ineffective, and regrets the decision of the Scottish MPs who voted to support the cut when the money could have been used to create thousands of jobs in green energy and public transport.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4004.3</strong> <strong>Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Budget Implications for Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4004) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the real-terms increase in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget for 2010-11; also welcomes the earlier measures that the UK Government has taken to support Scotland during the global downturn, such as the &pound;50 billion funding to Scottish banks to support bank workers, families and businesses who rely on the banks and the &pound;2 billion that has gone into the pockets of hard working Scots and the VAT cut that has given the equivalent of &pound;275 to every Scottish family and boosted retail sales; recognises that last week&rsquo;s Budget continues to provide real help now to families and businesses, such as the guarantee that anyone aged between 18 and 25 who has been unemployed for 12 months or more will be given a training place or a job and the new investment in the renewable energy industry, which will benefit Scotland, and calls on the Parliament to recognise the role the UK Government has taken in leading the international response to the global economic crisis.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>S3M-3978*#*</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Dementia Awareness Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that Dementia Awareness Week 2009 takes place from 31 May to 7 June; is aware that Alzheimer Scotland estimates that in 2009 there are 67,000 people with dementia in Scotland, including 1,640 people under the age of 65; notes that this number is expected to rise to 114,000 by 2031; acknowledges that it is disappointing to note that Dementia Awareness Week follows a year in which a number of highly critical reports have highlighted the inefficiencies and failures in the quality of care of people with dementia in the community, in care homes and in long-term hospital care; notes the recent Care Commission report,<em> Better care, every step of the way</em>, which reflects the findings of 1,036 inspections and three investigations that found that 43% of homes did not realise that they were to deliver palliative and end-of-life care for people with life-limiting illnesses such as dementia; further notes the recent Care Commission report,<em> Gradings So Far</em>, which has shown significant variations in the quality of care received by elderly people in care homes when compared to other groups; considers that the poor quality of care at home services revealed in a recent Panorama investigation is simply unacceptable and particularly harmful to those people with dementia who may not be able to speak out for themselves; therefore supports the work of the Cross Party Group on Alzheimer&rsquo;s, which calls for a Charter of Rights for people with dementia; further welcomes the decision by Alzheimer Scotland, in supporting this initiative, to host a series of roadshows across Scotland in June 2009, starting in Irvine on Friday 5 June, to consult people with dementia, their carers and other stakeholders on the content of a Charter of Rights; notes that the Charter of Rights seeks to ensure that individuals and their families have a clear set of rights from diagnosis through to end of life, and therefore considers that a fundamental culture change in care services would help ensure the highest quality of service provision to people with dementia.</p>
