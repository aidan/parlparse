            notes the Amnesty International Report which states that sanctions 

            imposed against Iraq by the UN Security Council in 1990 have crippled 

            Iraq's economic infrastructure, increased unemployment, raised malnutrition 

            and mortality levels and caused widespread corruption throughout Iraqi 

            society; further notes UNICEF estimates that sanctions have contributed 

            to the deaths of approximately 500,000 children under the age of 5 

            since 1990, and calls on the UN Security Council to end sanctions

            for Refugees, Refugee Action, the Refugee Council, Save the Children, 

            London Arts and the Arts Council in England; further notes that 2001 

            is the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the UN Convention on Refugees; 

            considers that Refugee Week presents an opportunity to give the public 

            some positive messages about refugees and asylum seekers via the media 

            and through events, and calls on MSPs to work with local agencies 

            in Scotland to promote positive messages about the contribution to

            a dossier of racial attacks on dispersed asylum seekers in Glasgow 

            produced by the Glasgow Asylum Rights Campaign, notes that the dossier 

            reflects some of the extreme violence and hostility that asylum seekers 

            have experienced in Glasgow since their arrival, and urges all MSPs, 

            MPs and councillors to read it and take action within their areas

            and valiant history of Scottish churches and many charities in fighting 

            against slavery; believes that disclosures of current brutality towards 

            children present only a fraction of the truth about enslavement of 

            hundreds of thousands of children which sometimes benefits the food 

            industry in Britain; demands that the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty’s 

            Government investigate immediately the use of child slaves and its 

            connections with the chocolate and cocoa industries in Britain; supports 

            the anti-Slavery League, Save the Children and all organisations pleading

            investigators of the chocolate trade, and calls upon all catering 

            suppliers to the Scottish Parliament to withdraw all products involving 

            chocolate or cocoa as a first small public gesture of the outrage

            foot and mouth disease in Scotland, a fight which has been carried 

            out on behalf of all of Scotland; notes the very severe economic consequences

            of Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights 

            (ECHR), which states that &quot;no person shall be denied the right 

            to education. In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in 

            relation to education and to teaching, the state shall respect the 

            rights of parents to ensure such education and teaching in conformity 

            with their own religious and philosophical convictions&quot;; supports 

            the principle of maintained denominational schools, as first introduced 

            by the Education Act 1918, which ensures that such education and teaching 

            is made available by local authorities for members of the Roman Catholic 

            faith, and believes that, should this principle be found to be in 

            contravention of any other article of the ECHR, all necessary steps 

            should be taken to ensure that such faith-based educational provision 

            continues to be available to children in Scotland in line with the 

            wishes of parents. </font></p>

            which will remove the function of meat inspection from official controls 

            and make the industry itself responsible for the carrying out of meat 

            inspection; notes the concern expressed by UNISON and others about 

            these proposals; believes that the use of independent government inspectors 

            working for the Meat Hygiene Service is the best way of ensuring the 

            safety of meat consumed by the public, and believes that a full and

            being sacked or illegally threatened with dismissal just because they

            of sending a message to the Scottish business sector that, such practices 

            are not only illegal, but wholly unacceptable in modern Scotland, 

            and of assisting smaller businesses to ensure that they can deliver

            that adulthood begins at 16 and that young people work, pay tax and 

            have much to contribute to society and politics; notes that the Electoral 

            Reform Society believes that there is a strong body of opinion in 

            favour of votes for 16-year-olds; recalls the First Minister’s opposition 

            to such electoral reform in <i>The Scotsman</i> on 28 January 1998, 

            claiming that there was no demand in the country that had been measured

            closure of Paterson’s Dump at Baillieston and Mount Vernon, Glasgow, 

            to protect the public and the environment in the light of the four 

            enforcement notices served on Paterson’s by the Scottish Environment 

            Protection Agency (SEPA) for failing to provide relief for outraged 

            local residents from the appalling smells and for being unable to 

            guarantee that the groundwater, which is close to the River Clyde, 

            was not being affected by the dump, which is licensed to take arsenic, 

            cyanide, asbestos and a total of 27 poisonous chemicals; recalls that 

            in November 1999, following a Public Health Department investigation 

            of the dump, Dr Harry Burns, Director of Public Health for Greater 

            Glasgow stated &quot;smells are, at times, literally breathtaking&quot;, 

            believes that, despite other attempts over the years, the continued 

            suffering of local people can only be alleviated by a total closure 

            of the dump, which is licensed to take up to 500,000 tonnes of waste 

            every year including sewage which is hauled through urban areas on 

            around 4,000 lorries; is deeply concerned that Paterson’s is the only 

            high level toxic dump still existing within a city boundary in Scotland 

            and that, after enduring the dump for 44 years, local people deserve 

            relief; is determined that the East End of Glasgow should not remain 

            a dumping ground for materials which many other areas will not accept; 

            does not approve of the continuing profits being made by the dump’s 

            owners while local tenants and council tax payers are subjected to 

            misery and restrictions on the enjoyment of their homes and therefore 

            calls upon SEPA to remove Paterson’s licence and enforce closure of 

            the dump immediately and thereby uphold their claim to be protectors 

            of the public and the environment.</font></p>

            physiotherapists, occupational therapists, radiographers, dieticians, 

            speech and language therapists, medical laboratory scientific officers,

            take account of the lack of similarity in the qualifications for,

            basis; believes that commitments made at the time the Health and Social 

            Care Bill’s passage through Westminster should be respected; further 

            believes that the proposals ignore devolution and disenfranchise Scotland,

            there is real concern also about community facilities which are closing

            much of the riverside is neglected, decaying and overgrown, and therefore 

            believes that consideration should be given to the introduction of 

            greater sanctions on individuals and companies dumping rubbish and 

            sewage in the river and to the setting up of a national river authority 

            consisting of representatives from the relevant local authorities

            against foot and mouth disease, and that, as a consequence of this 

            responsible action, the society now faces a substantial revenue loss; 

            recognises the international status of Edinburgh Zoo, which contains 

            36.2% of endangered species, forming part of a major involvement with 

            the survival and recovery programmes of international endangered species, 

            and which has active conservation and research programmes for behaviour 

            and nutrition and also provides benign research to many universities 

            and other higher learning institutes in Scotland and beyond; believes 

            that the Zoo is a major educational resource for primary and secondary 

            schools throughout Scotland, notes that it is in the top three paying 

            visitor attractions in Scotland yet receives no core funding from 

            the public sector, is currently not eligible for national lottery 

            funding and is virtually self-supporting, principally from charitable 

            sources and trading activities such as gate income, catering and retail 

            at the Zoo, and therefore invites the Scottish Executive, as a matter 

            of urgency, to consider financial support for this most valuable national 

            asset until it may re-open to the public.<strong><i> R</i></strong></font></p>

            objects to the Environment Agency’s proposal to allow Sellafield’s 

            high discharges of Tc-99 to continue until at least 2006; notes that 

            Tc-99 remains dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years and builds 

            up in the food chain, particularly in lobsters; notes with concern 

            that lobsters are still being found in south-west Scotland with levels 

            of Tc-99 close to the European Community Intervention Level (1,250 

            Bq/kg) after a nuclear accident, that levels in seaweed range from 

            2,800 Bq/kg in south-west Scotland to 910 Bq/kg in Cape Wrath and 

            therefore that the whole of the west coast of Scotland and beyond 

            is contaminated with Tc-99; is concerned that British Nuclear Fuels 

            Limited (BNFL) is planning to increase discharges of Tc-99 and many 

            radioactive substances as a result of its plan to increase the throughput 

            of its MAGNOX reprocessing plant, contrary to the UK Government’s 

            stated intent to substantially reduce or eliminate these discharges; 

            believes that radioactive waste should be concentrated and contained 

            in monitorable and retrievable form rather than being diluted and 

            dispersed in the seas around Scotland, and therefore requests that 

            Government and the nuclear industry’s regulators should stop BNFL 

            producing any more liquid Tc-99 and other radioactive wastes by ending 

            MAGNOX reprocessing at Sellafield and closing BNFL’s MAGNOX reactors 

            and furthermore should stop BNFL discharging its existing liquid Tc-99 

            wastes into the sea by converting them into a solid form that can 

            be contained and shielded on the Sellafield site.</font></p>

            that although the incidence of drownings is falling elsewhere in the 

            UK it is on the increase in Scotland; further notes that according 

            to data for 1999, there was a 50% increase on the previous year in 

            the number of children aged 14 and under who drowned and that, while 

            the majority occurred in rivers and streams, there was an increase 

            in drownings in garden ponds, water features and containers holding 

            water; is aware that England has a Water Safety Officer whose function 

            is to increase awareness of the dangers of waterways, while Scotland 

            has no such post and that while in England every child is expected 

            to be taught to swim 25 metres by the age of 11, in Scotland 14 out 

            of the 32 local authorities do not provide swimming lessons for all 

            pupils; further notes that in answer to question S1W-10389 by Mr Sam 

            Galbraith on 30 October 2000, the former Minister for Children and 

            Education refused to make it a duty of his office to collect centrally

            40-45 textile jobs with the closure of the Borders textile firm of 

            Murray Allan in Innerleithen, which has now suffered three major mill 

            closures in the last ten years, devastating a close-knit rural community; 

            further notes that the transfer of production to Hawick is to be accommodated 

            in premises sold to Clan Douglas, the sister company, in October 1999 

            for a bargain price and on highly favourable repayment terms by Scottish 

            Enterprise Borders (SEB), an arrangement which at the time was described 

            by them as &quot;allowing Clan Douglas to grow its export business 

            and increase employment&quot; and &quot;good news for the Borders 

            economy&quot;; further notes that not a penny of the £10 million textile 

            aid package announced by the Scottish Executive in June 2000 has been 

            spent, and considers that the Scottish Executive should act now to 

            stop further haemorrhaging of Borders textile jobs and to call to 

            account the management of public funds by SEB.</font></p>

            for 2001-02 to 2003-04 despite the fact that the service cutting Tory

            is substantially below the Scottish average; is aware that Glasgow 

            in financial year 2003-2004 will receive £72 per capita less in real 

            terms than in 1996-97; notes that council tax in Glasgow has risen 

            by 36% since 1996-97, compared to the Scottish average of 25.1% over 

            that period, taking it from the third highest to the highest in Scotland 

            and that, according to the City Council itself, council tax will have 

            to rise by twice the rate of inflation to prevent service cuts in
