            <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Scottish Ballet</strong>—That the Parliament notes 
            with regret moves made to transform Scottish Ballet into a contemporary 
            dance company without prior public discussion, takes account of the 
            views of the Scottish Ballet’s artistic director and the resident 
            dancers who all oppose the change, expresses concern that such a move 
            would undermine Scotland’s ability to stage a full length traditional 
            classical ballet, and calls upon Scottish Ballet to delay consideration 
            of such a significant change to its remit until such time as there 
            has been a full debate about the public support for dance in Scotland 
            and confirmation that there is a market to justify such a transformation.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-2125</strong> 
            <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Doors Open Day</strong>—That the Parliament welcomes 
            the Doors Open Day initiative, part of Scottish Archaeology Month 
            2001, which gives people the opportunity to visit and explore for 
            a day, free of charge, various buildings across Scotland such as castles, 
            stately homes and law courts, many of which are not normally open 
            to the public, and believes that the initiative gives people the opportunity 
            to improve their understanding of their local architectural environment 
            and the country’s rich built heritage.</font></p>

            <strong>Shona Robison: Fibromyalgia Awareness Week 15 - 22 September 2001</strong>—That 
            the Parliament notes and supports Fibromyalgia Awareness Week that 
            aims to raise the awareness of the &quot;hidden&quot; disability that 
            affects up to 100,000 people in Scotland; recognises the problems 
            faced by sufferers in claiming appropriate benefits and accessing 
            appropriate and sympathetic treatment, and calls for more research 
            into the condition so that Fibromyalgia Syndrome is treated as the 
            serious illness it is.</font></p>

            <strong>Brian Adam: Grampian University Hospitals NHS Trust's Financial 
            Problems</strong>—That the Parliament expresses grave concern over the 
            increasing financial deficit at the Grampian University Hospitals 
            NHS Trust; notes its plans to have a staff moratorium, reduce access 
            to services for General Practitioners, defer maintenance and equipment 
            purchase and restrict prescribing rights to drugs as part of its financial 
            recovery strategy, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to review 
            its funding formula as a matter of urgency.</font></p>

            <strong>Ian Jenkins: Bus Company Competition and the Needs of the Passenger</strong>—That 
            the Parliament believes that aggressive competition between bus companies 
            within the Edinburgh travel to work area is detrimental to the long-term 
            interests of passengers as demonstrated by the withdrawal of services 
            from outlying areas whilst companies compete for control of the most 
            profitable city centre routes; believes that this trend is unsustainable, 
            running contrary to the aims of the Executive’s integrated transport 
            policies, and urges Ministers to work with the area’s local authorities 
            to assess whether powers bestowed by the Transport (Scotland) Act 
            2001 can be used to ensure that stable and dependable bus services 
            are maintained at an appropriate level for bus users in settlements 
            outside Edinburgh.</font></p>

            <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Kilmarnock Football Club</strong>—That the Parliament 
            deplores the derogatory remarks about Kilmarnock Football Club by 
            a &quot;Labour strategist&quot; in the <i>Times</i> on 18 August 2001; 
            notes the involvement of Labour MP Jim Murphy in the story; further 
            notes that Kilmarnock FC finished fourth in the Scottish Premier League 
            last season and won the Scottish Cup in 1996-97, and believes that 
            such attacks on non-Old Firm clubs in the Scottish Premier League 
            have no part to play in determining the future structure of league 
            football in Scotland. </font></p>

            <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Threat to Civil Liberties at Govanhill Pool</strong>—That 
            the Parliament expresses its serious concern at the threat to civil 
            liberties posed by Strathclyde Police in their attempt to seize TV 
            footage of recent protests at Govanhill Pool; applauds the BBC for 
            refusing to hand over its film; calls upon the Minister for Justice 
            to make a statement backing the BBC, and further asks the Justice 
            Committees to investigate strengthening the law to prevent such police 
            action in future.</font></p>

            <strong>Paul Martin: Asylum Seekers</strong>—That the Parliament deplores the 
            recent racist attacks in Sighthill that have been carried out by a 
            minority; recognises that the community in Sighthill welcomes asylum 
            seekers and that they require support and resources to ensure successful 
            community relations; welcomes Glasgow City Council’s introduction 
            of an emergency action plan which will take a corporate approach to 
            tackling many of the estate management issues that face residents 
            in Sighthill, and considers that the Executive should ensure that 
            Scottish local authorities share examples of best practice and expertise 
            in implementing the dispersal programme, take steps to ensure that 
            local police levels are kept to the maximum level possible, consider 
            what additional resources can be allocated to assist communities with 
            integration and the delivery of local services and develop an action 
            plan that would work towards ensuring that councils and communities 
            are assisted and informed during the dispersal programme.</font></p>

            <strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: Oxfam</strong>—That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">congratulates 
            Linlithgow Oxfam Group on 26 years of fundraising and campaigning 
            for poverty eradication and social justice throughout the world; recognises 
            the contribution made by all Oxfam groups and individual supporters 
            in Scotland in raising awareness of our role and responsibility in 
            the world, and supports their efforts to increase action to meet the 
            UN 2015 poverty action targets.</a></font></p>
