<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-7097 Margaret Mitchell: Congratulations to Uddingston Pride</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Uddingston Pride, Uddingston, on winning the Urban Community Trophy at the 2010 Beautiful Scotland Award Ceremony, held in Glenrothes; notes that the group also won the award in 2008; further congratulates the group on its outstanding achievement in collecting a gold medal, which rewards those entries that delivered an exceptionally high standard throughout all of the Beautiful Scotland objectives; acknowledges that, for over 40 years, Beautiful Scotland has supported the efforts of groups such as Uddingston Pride in working to improve their local communities, and considers that the campaign rewards groups for their gardening abilities but also for their environmental responsibility and for getting people involved with their communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7096 Jamie Hepburn: Congratulations to Beautiful North Lanarkshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates communities across North Lanarkshire on winning 15 medals and three discretionary awards in the Beautiful Scotland campaign; notes that among the winners were Cumbernauld, Cumbernauld Village, having won silver medals, and Condorrat, which was awarded a bronze medal, and commends the level of involvement and commitment of local communities and all those involved across North Lanarkshire in making the 2010 Beautiful North Lanarkshire campaign such a success.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenneth Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7095 Joe FitzPatrick: Victoria and Albert Museum</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers as a major step forward in the development of the Victoria and Albert Museum in Dundee the showcasing of the six shortlisted designs at the University of Abertay in Dundee from 29 September 2010 at an exhibit entitled, V&amp;A at Dundee - Making it Happen; welcomes the fact that this free exhibition will be open to all residents and visitors of Dundee as late as 9pm and at weekends to allow everyone the opportunity to view the designs and express their opinion; views the project as an excellent opportunity for Dundee, bringing both extra employment and tourism to the city, following on from recent successes, such as the showcasing of Titian&rsquo;s <em>Diana and Actaeon</em> in the newly refurbished McManus Galleries, and believes that this will add to Scotland&rsquo;s wealth of internationally renowned culture.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7094 Joe FitzPatrick: Beautiful Scotland Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the city of Dundee on its recent clutch of accolades at this year&rsquo;s Beautiful Scotland Awards, particularly the communities of Ardler, which received a bronze medal certificate, and Broughty Ferry, which received a silver gilt medal certificate, on top of the whole city&rsquo;s silver medal certificate and Wright Sustainable Development Award.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7093 James Kelly: Cambuslang and Rutherglen Community Health Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Comic Relief has awarded Cambuslang and Rutherglen Community Health Initiative three years&rsquo; funding of &pound;120,000; notes that this award will contribute toward the mental health and volunteering work of the initiative, and recognises the hard work and dedication of the staff and volunteers.</p>
