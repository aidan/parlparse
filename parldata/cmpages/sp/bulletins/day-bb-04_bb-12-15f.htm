          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2166</strong> <STRONG>Patricia Ferguson:</STRONG> <STRONG>Tourism - Ambitions for Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the economic benefits of promoting the long-term growth of Scotland&rsquo;s tourism industry; approves of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s ambition, shared with VisitScotland and the tourism sector, of achieving 50% revenue growth over the next decade; notes that this will benefit the economies of rural as well as city and urban areas in every part of the country; appreciates that this long-term growth can only be achieved by ensuring that the marketing of Scotland in UK and overseas tourism markets is further strengthened and that the businesses that comprise the tourism and hospitality sectors are encouraged to compete even more strongly and coherently in this most competitive of global industries, and welcomes the additional funding given to VisitScotland to help achieve this.</P>

          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2165</strong> <STRONG>Murdo Fraser:</STRONG> <STRONG>Proposed Defence Reviews from a Scottish Perspective</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposed cuts in manpower from the Royal Air Force, the Royal Navy and Army throughout the United Kingdom; further notes that this would mean the merger of the Royal Scots and the King&rsquo;s Own Scottish Borderers into one battalion and the amalgamation of all five battalions into a super regiment of five battalions and a reduction in jobs and operations at RAF Lossiemouth and Kinloss; believes that this will have an adverse economic impact on the areas affected by the cuts; further believes that the Scottish regiments are an important part of the tradition and heritage of Scotland; notes that the recent war in Iraq was the latest conflict which showed Scotland&rsquo;s regiments to be a modern, effective fighting force; believes that, in a time of increased commitments across the globe, our armed forces must have the necessary resources and structure to protect our country, deter aggression and safeguard our vital interests in the wider world, and, accordingly, condemns any cuts and mergers and, in particular, believes that the six existing single battalion Scottish infantry regiments should be retained. </P>
          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2164</strong> <STRONG>Rosie Kane:</STRONG> <STRONG>Glasgow Anti-War Action</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Glasgow Anti-War Action which is embarking on a campaign of action across Scotland; congratulates the nine protesters who locked themselves onto three gates at BAE Systems complex in Edinburgh to highlight the fact that the company profits from war; deplores the fact that big business profits from misery and war; commends Glasgow Anti-War Action for having the courage to risk arrest in order to keep the public&rsquo;s attention on the issue, and calls on MSPs to join Glasgow Anti-War Action in protest against the brutality taking place in Iraq. </P>
          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2163#</strong> <STRONG>Mrs Nanette Milne:</STRONG> <STRONG>BP Portrait Award in Aberdeen</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the north east artist, Stephen Shankland, on winning first prize in the BP Portrait Award 2004; recognises that the BP Portrait Award is one of the most prestigious competitions of its type, and notes that 50 of the portraits entered into the competition, including the winners, can be seen at Aberdeen Art Gallery until 23 January 2005.</P>

          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2159</strong> <STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</STRONG> <STRONG>Decision Time</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees under Rule 11.2.4 of Standing Orders that Decision Time on Thursday 23 December 2004 be taken at 3.00 pm.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Tavish Scott<STRONG>*</strong> </P>
          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2158</strong> <STRONG>Miss Annabel Goldie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffending</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the unacceptable rate of reoffending occurring in Scotland today; accepts that there is a place in our criminal justice system for a range of different sentencing options to address this problem but recognises that when a prison sentence is the appropriate disposal then prison is not simply a punishment but is intended to rehabilitate, deter and protect the public; believes that the way to reduce reoffending and subsequently the prison population is to reduce the overall incidence of crime in Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to increase the police presence in our communities to deter and detect crime and to end automatic early release from our prisons to ensure honesty in sentencing.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Margaret Mitchell<STRONG>*</strong> </P>

          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2156#</strong> <STRONG>Rob Gibson:</STRONG> <STRONG>Improving Scottish Air Ambulance Services</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern a recent consultation by the Scottish Ambulance Service over the future of air ambulance services in Scotland from March 2006; further notes the intention to opt for a new provider with a radically different approach that uses one fewer aircraft to deliver the required work; welcomes the improved accommodation on the new types of aircraft on offer but highlights the deep concerns of Orkney Islands Council which has little confidence in these proposals without the retention of island-based fixed-wing aircraft in the new contract instead of relying on aircraft based in Aberdeen, Inverness or Glasgow; questions the availability of busy coastguard helicopters as back-up in bad weather; draws attention to Shetland Islands Council&rsquo;s wish to retain an Islander aircraft from the inter-island air service for emergencies; voices concern over the need for a helicopter refuelling stop at Oban on missions from Barra to Glasgow that could itself be affected by severe weather; reiterates the evidence of records for gales and fog which show that an improved air ambulance service for the remote mainland and islands of Scotland requires a greater investment in appropriate aircraft, more of which should be based in the places most affected by severe weather, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that a best value contract does not place lives in greater jeopardy under the proposed new contract.</P>

          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2155.1</strong> <STRONG>Mr David Davidson:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from "continuing" to end and insert "there is an urgent need to reform the NHS in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to place patients&rsquo; needs at the centre of the service, to give patients the choice to move anywhere within the NHS, to ensure that NHS capacity is supplemented where necessary by better collaboration and partnership with the independent and voluntary health and care sectors and to move to a system where money follows the patients, and further calls on the Executive to free health professionals and local managers to respond to patient needs on a local basis and to transfer resources away from bureaucracy and into front-line care."</P>

          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2155.2</strong> <STRONG>Dr Jean Turner:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from first "supports" to end and insert "welcomes the additional investment on health promotion, including its targeting of heart disease, cancer and stroke; however, urges the Scottish Executive as part of its next steps strategy and to fulfil its aim of returning all patients to the heart of the NHS, to include as part of the strategy a comprehensive review of services dedicated to palliative care and chronic conditions and, further, develop a national programme of diagnostic care, all of which continue to be under-resourced and under-funded, and believes that such a review will save the NHS money by identifying, treating and controlling such conditions in a more structured, preventative and cost-effective manner which will alleviate the consequent pressure on hospital beds and in-patient services."</P>

          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2155.3</strong> <STRONG>Shona Robison:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from first "supports" to end and insert "recognises the progress made in reducing mortality rates from coronary heart disease, cancer and stroke; believes in putting patients first by expanding capacity in the NHS to tackle unacceptably high waiting times for out-patient appointments and hospital admissions, and is concerned that any expansion of the private sector in Scotland can only be achieved at the expense of the NHS." </P>
          <P><STRONG>*S2M-2155.4</strong> <STRONG>Carolyn Leckie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from "continuing" to end and insert "radical continuing action is needed to turn around the poor health of many people in Scotland, most of it poverty-related; further notes that the Scottish Executive needs to do much more if mortality and morbidity are to be drastically reduced, life expectancy increased and health inequalities removed; recognises that the most effective health promotion measure would be the eradication of poverty; recognises that, while Scotland&rsquo;s people continue to suffer unacceptable levels of ill-health, the NHS needs to have the capacity to treat patients quickly, effectively and as close to their homes as possible; believes that the NHS in Scotland has suffered unprecedented and unsustainable reductions of capacity, particularly through bed cuts, hospital closures, PFI and budget deficits in the last 10 years and that there needs to be an immediate reversal of that trend by securing the NHS as a publicly-owned, publicly-delivered, universal, comprehensive service free at the point of need with the capacity to meet the needs of the population, and considers private health care to be a parasitic drain on NHS assets, resources and staff that merely converts public money into private profit whilst undermining the founding principles of the NHS and threatens its very existence as envisioned by Aneurin Bevan." </P>
