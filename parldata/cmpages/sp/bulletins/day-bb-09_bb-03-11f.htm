<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3676</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following revision to the programme of business for Wednesday 11 March 2009&mdash;</p>
<p>after</p>
<p><strong>2.30 pm</strong>&#9;&#9;Time for Reflection</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p>insert</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;&#9;Ministerial Statement: Compensation Payments for Prisoners</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3675</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Minimum Income Guarantee for Students</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of the higher and further education sector; notes the outcome of the <em>New Horizons: responding to the challenges of the 21st century </em>report and the need to involve key stakeholders in discussions about the funding of the university sector; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s students have been let down by the SNP&rsquo;s government failure to deliver on its manifesto pledge to dump student debt; notes the <em>Supporting a Smarter Scotland</em> consultation on student support and rejects its proposals for not adequately addressing student hardship, and calls on the Scottish Government to deliver a simplified support system, which includes a minimum income guarantee of &pound;7,000 per annum for full-time higher education students made up from a combination of grants, loans and parental contributions.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3674</strong> <strong>Alison McInnes:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen Crossrail</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament affirms its support for the Aberdeen Crossrail project, a vital infrastructure link for the region, which would provide a frequent cross-city rail service with commuter trains leaving Inverurie and Stonehaven for Aberdeen every 15 minutes and the opening of new stations north and south of Aberdeen including at Kintore, Newtonhill and Altens; notes that the project previously enjoyed cross-party support and was hailed as a key transport priority for the north east with the potential to bring significant economic and environmental benefits; deeply regrets that the project has been omitted from the Strategic Transport Projects Review, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a firm commitment to work with Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City councils through NESTRANS and its rail industry partners to restart the active development of the Aberdeen Crossrail project immediately.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3672</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Working in Partnership to Improve Hospital Hygiene</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the contribution of two recent initiatives by the Scottish Government to help improve the cleanliness of hospitals in Scotland; believes that government spending of &pound;400,000 on 250 steam cleaners for NHS boards across Scotland, with 61 steam cleaning kits to be provided in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area alone at a cost of &pound;98,000, will allow specialised cleaning to prevent Clostridium difficile and contribute towards reducing infection rates; further welcomes the announcement by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, of new random hygiene inspections, which will see all acute hospitals receive one planned and one unannounced inspection in the next three years as part of the new Care Environment Inspectorate regime, and hopes that the new inspectorate will complement NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s Cleaning Services and Peer Public Involvement Programme, which trains volunteers to cleaning standards in its hospitals and health centres.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3670</strong> <strong>Bob Doris:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Glasgow Credit Union</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow Credit Union, which loaned more than &pound;5 million in mortgages last year and supported another 70 new homeowners; believes that the value of credit unions to communities is vital, particularly during the current economic climate with banks becoming increasingly unwilling to lend; notes that the credit union has loaned more than &pound;13 million over the last three years and is preparing to offer more loans for first-time buyers in 2009, and also notes that Glasgow Credit Union helps citizens to save money and offers a range of savings accounts and mortgages.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3660</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Inspiring Women Politicians</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern, following International Women&rsquo;s Day on Sunday 8 March 2009, the recent report by Girlguiding UK that found that the 19% of UK MPs who are women are failing to inspire young women to become interested in politics; further notes that on average fewer than one-fourth of members of national parliaments are women, that out of 12 European Parliament presidents only two have been women and there has never been a woman president of the European Commission; recognises the world-class example set by the Scottish Parliament in having 45 women MSPs, four women ministers and in being the first to have a woman Deputy First Minister; highlights the precedent set by Elish Angiolini in being Scotland&rsquo;s first woman Procurator Fiscal, Solicitor General and Lord Advocate; hails Rwanda&rsquo;s example as the first parliament in the world to have a female majority, and finally calls on all politicians, leaders and business executives, men and women, to recognise the unique perspective that women offer and to work mindfully towards inspiring the next generation of female leaders so as to see a more representative democracy at decision-making tables around the world.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3656</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Aggreko</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Dumbarton-based firm Aggreko on its plans to build a new &pound;20 million plant in the Vale of Leven; notes that the company has been in the town for more than 30 years and currently employs over 200 people; further notes that this new plant will create an additional 120 construction jobs; warmly welcomes Aggreko&rsquo;s commitment to the local area by choosing to expand its operations in Dumbarton rather than relocating abroad; recognises that, despite the current economic climate, Aggreko has continued to flourish and over 80% of all Aggreko equipment across the world is produced in Dumbarton; commends the efforts of the staff, and wishes the company every success for the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3655</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Cemetery Memorabilia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned that Fife Council leaders and officials have enforced strict regulations relating to the size and area that can be used for cemetery memorabilia with little consultation with the community and with great insensitivity towards the feelings of the bereaved; is particularly appalled that these leaders and officials refused to represent or hear the concerns of the community at two public meetings; notes that this is an issue of concern, not just in Fife, but in other areas also; regrets that this enforcement of regulations is based on financial motivations, has no regard for care or compassion and is seen by any reasonable person as wholly heartless; is particularly aghast that one family, whose children are buried in Fife, feels so aggrieved at these regulations that it is seriously considering exhuming the bodies of its loved ones and relocating them to its own property, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene urgently to stop these callous activities by Fife Council and to ensure that all councils across Scotland are given guidance so that they can be caring and listening councils.</p>
