<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5569</strong> <strong>Murray Tosh:</strong> <strong>Investment in Building Affordable Rented Homes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the need for increased investment in building affordable rented homes; further acknowledges that the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review is the most significant opportunity to secure this funding, which is essential to achieve the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s target that all unintentionally homeless people will have the right to a home by 2012, and recognises the case for committing the funding for 30,000 affordable homes for rent over the period 2008 to 2011.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5568</strong> <strong>Dave Petrie:</strong> <strong>Western Isles Demographic Trends</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Comhairle nan Eilean Siar&rsquo;s report on the demographic structure of the Western Isles; welcomes the recent increase in migration to the Western Isles which is a tribute to the high quality of life, beauty of landscape and openness of its people that the islands provide; is concerned to see a long-term decrease in the number of schoolchildren, people of working age and women of child-bearing age in the Western Isles; is further concerned that only 29% of current inward migrants to the islands are women; acknowledges the threat to the island way of life in the isles by a rising age structure and dependent population ratio, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with the local authority and look at ways to encourage more women and families to the islands to protect their long-term future.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5567</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Biometric and Surveillance Systems in Schools</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent decision by UK ministers to issue guidance to schools on the use of biometric systems; welcomes the acknowledgement that a completely unregulated approach to such technologies is inappropriate; notes that biometric systems are in place in some Scottish schools; is concerned that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s initial description of parental consent as an &quot;essential pre-requisite&quot; before children can be fingerprinted has now been rephrased as merely a matter of &quot;good practice&quot;; considers that there is a need for clear guidance from the Executive on the use of biometric and surveillance systems in schools before any increase in their use is contemplated; notes that section 8 of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Bill is expected to lead to increased use of such systems; urges the Executive to produce guidance for education authorities on the implementation of section 8 and, in so doing, to give clear preference to systems other than those involving biometric and data-gathering technology; further notes that recent calls have been made for schools to introduce ID cards, CCTV, airport-style security scanners and random drug testing, and considers that wider debate is required on the role, if any, of such measures, the impact they may have on school culture and the limits within which they should operate.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5566&diams; </strong> <strong>John Home Robertson:</strong> <strong>The Battle of Prestonpans, 1745</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the historic significance of battlefield sites from Scotland&rsquo;s violent past and notes the success of the National Trust for Scotland in interpreting the site of the final defeat of the Jacobite army at Culloden Moor; recognises the powerful case for protection and appropriate management of hitherto neglected battlefield sites throughout Scotland; pays tribute to the Battle of Prestonpans (1745) Heritage Trust for its proposals to preserve, enhance and interpret the site of the Jacobite victory of 21 September 1745 and welcomes the active support of the wider local community for this initiative, and hopes that the battlefield site at Prestonpans will be protected and made accessible for the benefit of local people and visitors.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5565</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Solidarity with Lieutenant Ehren Watada</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the courageous stance of First Lieutenant Ehren Watada who on 22 June 2006 became the US Army&rsquo;s first commissioned officer to publicly refuse deployment to Iraq; notes that Lieutenant Watada, who appeared before a court martial on 5 February 2007, faces up to six years imprisonment for refusing to deploy to Iraq and for speaking out against a war that he believes is illegal, stating on the day he announced his decision &quot;As the order to take part in an illegal act is ultimately unlawful as well, I must refuse that order&quot;; further notes and applauds the following words spoken by Ehren Watada when he addressed the Veterans for Peace National Convention in America last year &quot;I stand before you today, not as an expert, not as one who pretends to have all the answers. I am simply an American and a servant of the American people. My humble opinions today are just that. I realise that you may not agree with everything I have to say. However, I did not choose to be a leader for popularity. I did it to serve and make better the soldiers of this country. And I swore to carry out this charge honourably under the rule of law. To stop an illegal and unjust war, soldiers can choose to stop fighting it. It became instrumental in ending the Vietnam war, but it has been long since forgotten. Now it is not an easy task for the soldier. For they must be aware that they are being used for ill gain. They must hold themselves responsible for individual action. They must remember that duty to the constitution and the people supersedes the ideologies of their leadership. The soldier must be willing to face ostracism by their peers, worry over the survival of their families and, of course, the loss of personal freedom. They must know that resisting an authoritarian government at home is equally important to fighting a foreign aggressor on the battlefield. Finally, those wearing the uniform must know beyond any doubt that, by refusing immoral and illegal orders, they will be supported by the people not with mere words but by action. Awareness of the history of atrocities and destruction committed in the name of America &ndash; either through direct military intervention or by proxy war &ndash; is crucial. They must realise that this is a war not out of self defence but by choice for profit and imperialistic domination. They must know that neither Congress nor this administration has the authority to violate the prohibition against pre-emptive war &ndash; an American law that still stands today. Though the American soldier wants to do right, the illegitimacy of the occupation itself, the policies of the administration and rules of engagement of desperate field commanders will ultimately force them to be a party of war crimes. The Nuremberg Trials showed America and the world that citizenry as well as soldiers have the unrelinquishable obligation to refuse complicity in war crimes perpetrated by their government. Widespread torture and inhumane treatment of detainees is a war crime. A war of aggression born through an unofficial policy of prevention is a crime against the peace. An occupation violating the very essence of international humanitarian law and sovereignty is a crime against humanity. These crimes are funded by our tax dollars. Should citizens choose to remain silent through self-imposed ignorance or choice, it makes them as culpable as a soldier in these crimes. I have broken no law but the code of silence and unquestioning loyalty. If I am guilty of any crime, it is that I learned too much and cared too deeply for the meaningless loss of my fellow soldiers and my fellow human beings. If I am to be punished, it should be for following the rule of law over the immoral orders of one man. If I am to be punished it should be for not acting sooner. Martin Luther King Jr once said &quot;History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period was not the strident clamour of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.&quot; The time to fight back is now &ndash; the time to stand up and be counted is today&quot;; notes that Watada ended with another quote from Martin Luther King, &quot;One who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is, in reality, expressing the highest respect for the law&quot;; agrees to send a message of solidarity to Lieutenant Ehren Watada, and encourages Members and parliament staff to sign the on-line petition at: http://gao.org/ltwatada/join.html.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5564</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Increasing the Use of the Donald Dewar Room</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the little use made of the Donald Dewar Room, as evidenced by the figures recently produced by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre indicating that during 2006 it provided keys for an average of 11 visits per month and that the figures for the four months from September to December 2006 indicated an average of five people on each visit, and invites the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to put into effect changes in the arrangements for use of the Donald Dewar Room to enable more use to be made of it,&nbsp;either by visitors or by Members and staff.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-5476*#*</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>London Olympics Funding Shortfall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern press reports that indicate that an additional &pound;51 million of Scottish lottery funding may be siphoned off to help fund the 2012 London Olympics, which are now grossly over budget with an additional &pound;900 million having been identified as necessary thus far; heeds the concerns of the Big Lottery Fund Scotland that the demand for Scotland&rsquo;s lottery cash will grow further as well as those of Sir Clive Booth, director of the Big Lottery Fund in England who has claimed that &quot;dark forces in Whitehall&quot; are going to use lottery monies to plug the Olympics black hole; believes that Scotland has already paid more than its fair share towards the 2012 London Olympics, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make clear the level of opposition that exists in Scotland to having Scottish lottery funds plundered to pay for the 2012 Olympic Games at the expense of grassroots sport in Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and across Scotland and of other good causes.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-5295*#*</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Nuclear Submarine Workers&rsquo; Health and Safety at HM Naval Base Faslane</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament shares the concern of the former Faslane and Rosyth radiation controller, Mr John Connor, that no mandatory secondary monitoring (MSM) takes place on radiation workers leaving nuclear submarines at the naval base; notes that Mr Connor has approached the Health and Safety Executive, the Ministry of Defence and the Westminster Parliamentary Ombudsman regarding his concerns that MSM is implemented in all other nuclear establishments in Britain, but not those at Faslane and Rosyth, and the need to protect all those working on nuclear submarines from radiation sicknesses, and *considers that* the Defence Select Committee at Westminster *should* investigate the substance of Mr Connor&rsquo;s concerns at the earliest possible opportunity and allay the fears of many former employees and their families as well as those currently working at Faslane regarding nuclear safety.</p>
