<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong><br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;<br />
  </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong><br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">current motions</a> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Any questions in relation to this section should be directed to the Chamber Desk, for which contact details are provided at the end of the Bulletin.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00067 Alison Johnstone: Protect and Enhance Inverleith Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by City of Edinburgh Council to investigate how the depot site at Inverleith Park came to be redesignated; notes what it considers the formidable efforts of the Save Inverleith Park Campaign to inform local and national government of the strength of public objection to the proposal to dispose of this part of the park for luxury housing, generating a petition including over 8,000 signatures, and supports efforts to have the entire park area included in the council&rsquo;s Open Space audit, to involve the community in deciding its future use and to fully investigate the common-good status of the park.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00066 David Stewart: Graduated Driving Licence Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the research published by Dr Sarah Jones from Cardiff University in relation to the graduated driving licence scheme that shows that in Scotland between 2000 and 2007 there was almost no change in the number of road collisions involving young drivers, while the number of road collisions involving older people fell by 19% over the same period; supports the view that, if such a scheme was introduced in Scotland, up to 22 lives per year on average could be saved; believes that up to &pound;80 million could be saved every year with the introduction of a graduated driving licence scheme; further notes the work being undertaken by the Sensible Driving Always Arriving campaign, which is being run in the Highlands, that aims to educate young people on the dangers of irresponsible driving, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with the Department for Transport to implement a pilot scheme in Scotland to evaluate whether this can help reduce the number of deaths of young people on Scotland&rsquo;s roads.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00065 Kenneth Gibson: Supplying the World with Renewable Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the<em> Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation</em> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which discusses the great potential of renewables in supplying the world&rsquo;s energy needs and further recognises the need to continue investment in renewable energy to make these power and heating sources increasingly cost effective and efficient.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00064 Kenneth Gibson: Geothermal Energy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the need for further study and use of geothermal energy to help meet the energy needs of Scotland; further recognises the large-scale potential of geothermal energy as a renewable, clean and cost-efficient source of heating and power; understands that much of Scotland would be favourable to geothermal energy with current technological processes, and welcomes the benefits that an increase in geothermal investment would provide to local industry in developing this source of power.</p>
<p>Supported by: Bill Kidd*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00063 Margaret McDougall: Irvine Meadow Wins Western Super League</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Irvine Meadow XI FC on winning the 2010-11 Western Super League Premier Division; commends the players and the committee for their commitment; notes that this win means that the Medda has qualified for the 2011-12 Scottish Cup, where it could be taking on Scottish Premier League teams; wishes it and its fans all the best for this, and considers that this win gives a much needed boost to the local community and a lift to junior football in the area.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00057 Willie Coffey: Support for Skills Development Scotland and Job Creation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern research published by the TUC that it considers demonstrates that the current economic crisis has seen the ratio of registered unemployed people to vacancies increase dramatically throughout the United Kingdom, with East Ayrshire hit particularly badly as a consequence of Diageo&rsquo;s decision to close its facilities at Kilmarnock and Hurlford; expresses its support for the work done by Skills Development Scotland to support employers in taking on new staff, including its work with Ferguson&rsquo;s and Lamond&rsquo;s bakeries in Kilmarnock; notes that the company was the subject of a takeover two years ago, since when it has undergone major restructuring, moved into a new state-of-the-art factory, developed new products and won new contracts; further notes that support from Skills Development Scotland resulted in the company recruiting new employees supported by an initial subsidy of 50% of their wages; considers that close working between employers and the Scottish Government will be vital in generating the jobs needed in the years ahead, and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to work in partnership with the Federation of Small Businesses to support small businesses in taking on up to 40,000 additional employees.</p>

<p><strong>S4M-00045 Bill Kidd: Trident Initial Gate Just the Start</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the UK Government announcement that it plans, over the next five years, to spend several billion pounds on new nuclear-armed submarines and that each of these will be powered by its own onboard PWR3 nuclear reactor, which will further increase the cost of the Trident replacement programme, and expresses concern that the UK Government&rsquo;s plan is for these new submarines to be based at Faslane until the year 2060, which it considers flies in the face of the 2007 vote of the Scottish Parliament and of consistent polling of the Scottish population to strongly oppose this programme on moral and financial grounds.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00045.1 Jackie Baillie: Trident Initial Gate Just the Start</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00045 in the name of Bill Kidd (Trident Initial Gate Just the Start), leave out from &quot;with regret&quot; to end and insert &quot;that there are 11,000 people employed as a consequence of HMNB Clyde at Faslane, 6,500 by the MOD with a further 4,500 due to the impact of income multipliers and the supply chain; understands that up to a further 3,000 service personnel will be transferred to the base in the next few years, making a positive impact on the local economy; acknowledges that this is the largest single-site employer in the West of Scotland and accounts for a quarter of the full-time workforce in West Dunbartonshire, and believes that, irrespective of whether you believe in unilateral or multilateral disarmament, it is incumbent on politicians to consider the consequences of their actions and that the SNP has no plans for alternative employment for all those employed at the base.&quot;</p>
