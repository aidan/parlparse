(b) that Stage 1 of the Building (Scotland) Bill be completed by 6 December 2002 
and that the date for completion of Stage 2 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill 
be extended to 6 November 2002.</P><P>Supported by: Euan Robson*</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3450</STRONG> 
<STRONG> Malcolm Chisholm: Action Against Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament recognises the unacceptable toll which coronary heart disease and 
stroke continue to take on Scottish families and communities; acknowledges the 
role of front-line staff in delivering and developing services for the thousands 
of people affected each year; supports health improvement initiatives to reduce 
the incidence of the diseases and the disproportionate burden suffered by the 
most disadvantaged communities, and looks forward to the development of more integrated 
services that are backed up by significant and dedicated resources.</P><P>Supported 
by: Mrs Mary Mulligan<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mr Frank McAveety<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> 
<STRONG>*S1M-3449</STRONG> <STRONG>Fiona Hyslop: Disabled Persons Housing Service 
(Lothian)</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes with serious concern that the 
Disabled Persons Housing Service (Lothian) (DPHS) has announced that it will need 
to close on 31 December 2002 owing to a lack of financial support from City of 
Edinburgh Council; notes that this service is internationally renowned; recalls 
that cross-party support was expressed for DPHS, including the support of ministers, 
and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to consider securing properly the future 
funding of DPHS and extending the service to other areas of the country in order 
to ensure that strategies to improve equality can help deliver services to those 
that need them.</P><P>Supported by: Linda Fabiani<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3448</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Death of Yoni Jesner</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
expresses horror at the death of 19-year-old Yoni Jesner from Giffnock in East 
Renfrewshire at the hands of a suicide bomber in a public street in Tel Aviv on 
19 September 2002; acknowledges the impact of this atrocity on the Jewish community 
here in Scotland; believes there can be no justification for such an appalling 
act; wishes to express its sympathy to Yoni's family and friends; is greatly moved 
by the donation of Yoni's liver and other organs, which have been used to save 
the life of a young Palestinian child, and believes that such a practical and 
symbolic gesture demonstrates the power of tolerance, friendship and common humanity 
over hate and violence.</P><P>Supported by: Michael Matheson<STRONG>*</STRONG>, 
Margaret Jamieson<STRONG>*</STRONG>, David Mundell<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P> <STRONG>*S1M-3447#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Inquiry Into Glasgow Housing Stock Transfer</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes that, since the ballot to transfer Glasgow&#146;s housing 
stock, the entire process has been fraught with lengthy delays and constant changes 
to the business plan and that significant sums of money have been spent on consultants 
rather than repairing homes in Glasgow for over two years; further notes with 
concern that, in this period, many Glasgow tenants have had minimal repairs carried 
out and continue to live in houses in serious disrepair, that the timetable for 
carrying out repairs given to tenants prior to the ballot is now unachievable 
and that consultants report that the financial costs of the scheme have been seriously 
underestimated; recognises that a crisis of tenant participation in local housing 
associations has developed, totally undermining the supposed central objective 
of the transfer process, namely improved tenant involvement and participation 
in managing housing stock; further recognises that recent events conclusively 
prove that the large scale housing stock transfer model is an expensive and complex 
mechanism for improving housing stock; believes that the Scottish Executive should 
recognise that the promises made to tenants prior to the ballot have not been 
carried out, with Glasgow tenants still suffering from sub-standard housing, and 
considers that the Executive should urgently hold a full inquiry into this gross 
misuse of public money.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3446</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: 
Mental Health (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament, 
for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Mental 
Health (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure payable out of the Scottish 
Consolidated Fund in consequence of the Act.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3445</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Irene McGugan: Chris Hoy Track Cycling Success</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">congratulates Scottish cyclist Chris Hoy on winning 
gold in the Men&#146;s 1 km time trial at the Track Cycling World Championships, 
held in Copenhagen between 25 and 29 September 2002; further congratulates Chris 
Hoy on adding this significant and well-deserved success to his Commonwealth Games 
title won in Manchester in August 2002; regrets that Chris Hoy, along with other 
professional Scottish cyclists, is forced to further his cycling career away from 
Scotland owing to the lack of an adequate all-weather facility at the Meadowbank 
velodrome in Edinburgh, currently the only velodrome in Scotland; supports the 
urgent need to provide such all-weather sporting facilities for both "elite" cyclists 
and others interested in pursuing a healthy and active lifestyle, many of whom 
are young people and children, and urges the Scottish Executive and <STRONG>sport</STRONG>scotland 
to provide the funding necessary to the creation of these facilities.</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3444
