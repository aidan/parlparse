<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-135</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>30 a Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the British Heart Foundation&rsquo;s (BHF) 30 a Day campaign, which aims to encourage people aged over 50 to invest in their health and well-being by getting active; notes that inactivity is a key risk factor for coronary heart disease, the most common cause of premature death in Scotland, as well as raising the risk of other life-threatening diseases; recognises that just 30 minutes of moderate physical activity at least five times a week can halve the risk of heart disease; notes with concern that less than half of men and a third of women in Scotland are meeting this recommendation and that these numbers decline with age; supports the view that, while personal action is key to raising physical activity levels among this age group, there are a number of policy measures that can support older adults in becoming more active, and joins the BHF in calling on the Scottish Executive and local authorities to ensure that helping people aged over 50 to get active becomes a higher priority.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-134#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Green Initiatives</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the actions taken by BAE Systems in Glasgow which have changed the method for painting warships, leading to reductions in the use of over 12,000 litres of paint and in the production of 10 tonnes of volatile compound emissions, a cut in landfill by over 300 tonnes and cost savings of tens of thousands of pounds; believes that, by developing innovative approaches to tackling environmental issues, institutions, businesses and individuals play a vital role in developing environmental policy, and recognises the importance of looking at ways of achieving these ends.</p>
