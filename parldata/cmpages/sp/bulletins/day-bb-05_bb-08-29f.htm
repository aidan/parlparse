          <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an "R".</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

          <p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3192</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society for its successful floodlit re-enactment of the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath in Arbroath Abbey; commends the fact that the cast is made up of local people from all walks of life who give up their spare time to take part in the re-enactment as well as making costumes and props to a professional standard; recognises the ambassadorial role that the society has with the Scottish expatriate community; acknowledges that the society is obliged to raise the substantial sums of money required to fund the production that has marked the anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath since 1947, and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that the town of Arbroath is given a more prominent role in future Tartan Day celebrations.</p>
          
          <p><strong>*S2M-3191#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Walk for Wallace</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates David Ross, Convener of the Wallace Society, on his magnificent achievement of walking from Glasgow to London to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the execution of William Wallace, one of Scotland&rsquo;s greatest patriots; notes the increasing interest generated by these events in Scottish history and the call for this subject to be included in the school curriculum, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that Scottish history is given its rightful place within the education system.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3190#</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Supply of Affordable Housing in Rural Areas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that new pension rules to be introduced in April 2006 allowing funds from self-invested personal pension plans to be invested in residential property, such as buy to let or holiday homes with up to 40% tax relief, and allowing residential property already owned to be moved into pensions schemes will reduce the availability of affordable housing, particularly in rural areas where young people are already facing difficulties in finding housing to buy or rent, and considers that the Scottish Executive and UK Government should reconsider the proposals, taking into account the particular issues surrounding rural housing in Scotland, and should exempt housing in Scotland from these new pension provisions.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3189</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Police Attendance at Incidents of Drugs Overdosing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the intention that police no longer attend reported incidents of drug overdoses; believes that police can provide direct assistance in the often difficult circumstances surrounding such incidents; understands that lives have been saved through police attendance, and calls for reinstatement of previous policy and practice.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-3188</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Robin House</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Children&rsquo;s Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) on the completion of Robin House in Balloch in August 2005; recognises that Robin House will be a welcome addition to parents and children in the west of Scotland and will see an enhanced capacity for 300 children and their families between Robin House and Rachel House in Kinross; commends the commitment and effort of the fundraisers and staff involved in the creation of this vital hospice; notes that CHAS is currently running a consultation, one aim of which is to develop appropriate funding structures for the future, and encourages the Scottish Executive to assist where possible in providing funding to secure this national resource.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-3187</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament accepts that various travel and accommodation allowances are designed to ensure that elected MSPs are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenditure whilst endeavouring to represent their constituents; rejects, however, the use of the Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance (EAA) by certain MSPs to purchase properties at public expense which they then privately profit from when they decide to sell on; regrets that, to date, several MSPs have personally pocketed large sums of money through use of the EAA and that this practice brings the whole Parliament into disrepute; believes that no MSP should personally profit from an allowance scheme introduced to meet away-from-home living costs and that the current EAA should be radically altered to ensure that any surplus accrued to properties purchased under the scheme is returned to the Parliament; believes that the 90-minute rule for qualification for the EAA should be re-examined and applied to each MSP&rsquo;s actual home address and not their constituency; recognises that MSPs are paid a very large wage which places them in the top 4% of income earners in Scotland; believes that the use of public money for travel and allowance schemes must be above reproach but considers that the current EAA fails that test as it allows MSPs to pocket thousands of pounds personally at public expense, and therefore agrees that the current second-homes scandal must be stopped.</p>
          
          <p><strong>*S2M-3186</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Social Affordable Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the intolerable standard of some of the housing available in the private and public rented sector; expresses disapproval of the complex and arbitrary nature of some council and housing association house allocation systems which do not address the needs of tenants; condemns the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s housing policy which has resulted in fewer houses being built for the public rented sector and less investment in housing stock to maintain standards, and calls on the Executive to review its housing policy and start an immediate programme of house building to provide socially affordable public housing for all who require it.</p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-3177</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Aberdeen City Council Pay Restructuring</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the decision by the administration of Aberdeen City Council to restructure pay in a way which could see some staff have their pay reduced by as much as 30%; notes that staff are now considering industrial action as a result of this decision; believes that the dismay and anger of the Council&rsquo;s workers not only result from this decision but also from the entirely inadequate consultation with trade unions during the pay restructuring process; further believes that, while the national agreement between COSLA and the trade unions to ensure that poorly paid council staff do indeed receive fairer wages is very welcome, Aberdeen City Council&rsquo;s administration has approached this process in an inept and unfair manner, and urges the Council administration to acknowledge the concerns of its staff, meet with trade unions and reconsider its proposals.</p>
