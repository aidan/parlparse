<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4528</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Strathspey Thistle FC</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Strathspey Thistle FC on its move to the Highland Football League (HFL); notes that its first home match in this senior football league will be on 6 August 2009 and believes that many people from the area will turn out to watch this match and continue to support the local team in the months and years ahead; understands the urgency to implement the changes to the ground required in order for the club to take its place in the league following a vote by existing HFL clubs in February to admit three further teams, including Strathspey Thistle, into the country<font lang="ZH-CN" xml:lang="ZH-CN">&rsquo;</font>s most northern senior football league; congratulates the club on its vision to encourage youth football in the area with a youth committee formed to oversee an under-13s and under-14s team for the Moray Youth League and an under-15s team in the HFL Development League, and wishes the entire team, committee and supporters the best of luck for their first season in senior football.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4527</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Unfair Charges for Supplemental Oxygen by Airlines</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that many individuals with a variety of conditions require supplemental oxygen when travelling by air; is concerned that many airlines continue to charge for providing passengers with the supplemental oxygen that they require; believes that this is effectively profiteering from disabled people; calls on those airlines that continue to charge passengers requiring in-flight supplemental oxygen to cease doing so by allowing such passengers either to bring personal oxygen equipment on board and use it or to have supplemental oxygen provided for them, in both cases without charge; welcomes the recent decision by British Airways, Emirates and Cathay Pacific to drop all charges; notes that as of 1 May 2009 airlines in the United States of America have to allow passengers requiring supplemental oxygen to use their own portable oxygen concentrator free of charge, and calls for airlines operating from Scotland that at present levy charges for the provision of in-flight supplemental oxygen to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4526</strong> <strong>Andrew Welsh on behalf of the Finance Committee:</strong> <strong>Strategic Budget Scrutiny</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Finance Committee&rsquo;s 2nd Report 2009 (Session 3): <em>Strategic Budget Scrutiny</em> (SP Paper 283).</p>
<p>Supported by: Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4525</strong> <strong>Ken Macintosh:</strong> <strong>Participation in the Edinburgh International Film Festival</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the 2009 Edinburgh International Film Festival and the contribution that the event makes to Scottish cultural life; appreciates the pleasure that the festival has brought audiences and the platform that it has provided to film makers from Scotland and around the world; recognises the importance of film in challenging prejudice and tackling controversial subjects; notes, for example, the number of Arab, Palestinian and Israeli productions focussing on the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the number of those films reflecting varied and opposing points of view that have received funding from the Israeli Film Fund; therefore expresses concern at the decision of the film festival to return a grant made by the Israeli Embassy to help an Israeli director participate in this important cultural event; calls for all communities and voices to be heard in such a creative forum, and greets with relief the news that the Israeli director will be able to attend the Edinburgh International Film Festival after all.</p>
