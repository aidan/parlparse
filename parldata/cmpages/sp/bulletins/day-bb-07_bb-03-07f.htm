<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5713</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Concerns over &quot;Son of Star Wars&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses in the strongest possible terms its grave concern and condemnation of recently reported secret lobbying by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to have the US missile defence system known as &quot;son of Star Wars&quot; based in Britain, in light of the wide opposition in Scotland to the replacement of Trident and the intransigent position of the UK Government on this issue; believes that, as a peaceful nation, Scotland wishes to send a clear message to the rest of the world that it is fiercely opposed to these talks and the wider implications that any future &quot;son of Star Wars&quot; would have on world security, and urges the Scottish Executive to state its opposition to the &quot;son of Star Wars&quot; and allay any fears that people may have that this missile system could be based in Scotland by issuing an assurance that it will do everything in its power to ensure that this system will never be based in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5712</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that, during Stage 3 of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill, debate on groups of amendments shall, subject to Rule 9.8.4A, be brought to a conclusion by the time limit indicated, each time limit being calculated from when the Stage begins and excluding any periods when other business is under consideration or when a meeting of the Parliament is suspended (other than a suspension following the first division in each of the morning and the afternoon being called) or otherwise not in progress:</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-5697</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>Living with Heart Failure</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the visit to the Parliament of people living with heart failure and their supporters and carers from across Scotland as part of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Scotland and Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland (CHSS) organised reception in the Garden Lobby on 7 March 2007; notes that heart failure is a serious and debilitating condition for which there is no cure and which affects around 100,000 people in Scotland; acknowledges that specialist heart failure services can reduce unnecessary hospital visits, massively improve quality of life for sufferers and carers and, most importantly, prevent premature deaths, and supports the call from BHF Scotland and CHSS that the Scottish Executive should conduct a national review of the provision of specialist heart failure services across Scotland and give a commitment that every person living with heart failure has access to specialist care in their local community.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5692.1</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Tackling Alcohol Misuse</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5692) in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;and calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that an increase in the number of police walking the streets would help to enforce the law, and welcomes the recent partnership between the Scottish Executive, the Scotch Whisky Association and eight other trade associations representing alcohol producers and retailers to tackle alcohol abuse.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5692.2</strong> <strong>George Lyon:</strong> <strong>Tackling Alcohol Misuse</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5692) in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;the damage excessive drinking can cause to physical and mental health, our communities, our economy, and our way of life; notes the success of the Fife test purchasing pilot and welcomes its proposed rollout to all police forces; welcomes that the vast majority of licensed retailers in the Fife pilot refused to sell alcohol to those under age; believes that the provisions of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 provide a solid foundation for future action to combat problem drinking; notes that this Act already sets out a range of irresponsible drinks promotions in both on-sales and off-sales that will not be permitted when the Act replaces the current licensing regime; welcomes the publication of the updated <em>Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems</em> and the industry partnership agreement, the actions from which represent a significant programme to reduce alcohol misuse; supports the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to extend the Keep Well initiative as a way of ensuring&nbsp;that those most at risk from the effects of excessive drinking in our deprived communities are offered advice and support; recognises that the problems associated with excessive drinking require action from industry, government and individuals, and notes that changing culture and behaviours will require a long-term collaborative approach where everyone takes responsibility for our society&rsquo;s excessive consumption.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5690.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Economy and Small Business</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5690) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;condemns the proposals put forward by the SNP and the Liberal Democrats for a local income tax which would represent a significant new financial burden for the many small businesses that are unincorporated; further condemns the policies of the Lib-Lab pact which have done so much to harm business, especially the decision taken by Jack McConnell MSP to abolish the uniform business rate in 2000 which has cost Scottish businesses an extra &pound;900 million, and welcomes the fully costed proposals put forward in the Scottish Conservatives&rsquo; business manifesto, including the abolition of business rates for all firms with a rateable value under &pound;7,000, a tiered rates cut for all firms with a rateable value of between &pound;7,000 and &pound;15,000, a &pound;20 million annual town centre regeneration fund, a dedicated public procurement unit to cut through the bureaucratised process of approval when businesses are tendering for public contracts, five-year sunset clauses on all primary legislation, a presumption against gold-plating of EU regulation, a new dedicated skills agency to work with business, schools and colleges to tackle the skills shortage, extra investment in the road network to prioritise improvements on key links such as the A9, A75, A96 and A82, and the building of a new Forth crossing, a package which will deliver real benefits to Scotland&rsquo;s small business and lead to higher economic growth.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5690.2</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Economy and Small Business</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5690) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end, and insert &quot;acknowledges the enormous contribution made by small businesses to the Scottish economy; notes that 98% of Scottish businesses employ less than 50 people and that small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) support 41% of business turnover and 52% of all private sector employment; believes that the current system of business rates works against the interests of small businesses and in favour of larger companies and that replacing business rates with a system of land value taxation would help to redress the balance; further notes that the power of supermarkets needs to be reigned in through an independent food supply chain regulator and that local business would benefit greatly from proposed green legislation that would make green public procurement mandatory rather than optional, and recognises the increasingly important role that small businesses will play in the localised, low carbon economy of Scotland&rsquo;s future.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5690.3</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>Economy and Small Business</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5690) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;to make&quot; to end and insert&nbsp; &quot;to continue to grow the Scottish economy and to support the competitiveness of Scottish businesses; welcomes the steps that the Scottish Executive has taken to achieve that by listening to business and reducing the level of business rates; supports measures to encourage innovation, including supporting links to Scotland&rsquo;s science and research base and easing access by business to public sector contracts; welcomes support from Scottish Enterprise and the Business Gateway through investing in a highly skilled workforce in Scotland, such as through the modern apprenticeships scheme, and increasing investment in the infrastructure necessary to build a modern competitive economy.&quot;</p>
