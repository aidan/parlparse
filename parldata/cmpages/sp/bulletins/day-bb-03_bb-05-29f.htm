            (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-83</strong> <strong>Colin Fox: Cuban Miami Five</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament expresses concern at the trial and detention in the 
            United States of America of Cuban nationals Antonio Guerrero Rodriguez, 
            Fernando Gonzalez Llort, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo, Ramon Labanino 
            Salazar and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert, known as the Miami Five; considers 
            that the nature of the charges, the location of the trial in Miami, 
            Florida, in an atmosphere of media and public intimidation and the 
            length of the sentences subsequently handed down call into question 
            the safety of the judicial process; notes that the immediate families 
            of the detainees have been unable to visit them as they have been 
            denied entry to the USA, and believes that the US Government should 
            support the petition for a retrial and ensure that it is held in a 
            jurisdiction that guarantees a fair trial.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-82</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson: Robin Rigg 
            Offshore Wind Farm (Navigation and Fishing) (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament agrees that the Robin Rigg Offshore Wind Farm (Navigation 
            and Fishing) (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-81#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Planning Law </strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming Planning Bill proposed by 
            the Scottish Executive in the consultation paper <em>Your place, your 
            plan: A White Paper on Public Involvement in Planning</em>; considers 
            that the consultation is of extreme importance in assessing the outstanding 
            needs to improve our planning law; believes that there is a particular 
            need to build in greater fairness for local residents affected by 
            planning decisions and that changes to the law should include a qualified 
            right of appeal against decisions of the planning authority for those 
            directly affected by a planning decision; further believes that there 
            must be improvements in the neighbourhood notification system and 
            a new right for objectors to receive some expert assistance to present 
            their case; believes that, as the relevant elected representatives, 
            MSPs should be directly notified by the Scottish Executive of planning 
            appeals received from within their constituencies, and considers that 
            the Executive should consider fully these changes and ensure that 
            the process of decision making in planning is open and transparent 
            at both local authority and Executive level.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-80</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: MTV Awards</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament appreciates the contribution made by the Scottish contemporary 
            music industry to Scottish arts and culture and, most particularly, 
            to the Scottish economy; notes the broad range of talents and skills 
            within the industry, including songwriters, musicians, educators, 
            producers, technicians, small business record labels, recording studios, 
            broadcasters, agents, promoters and venue and festival organisers; 
            is proud of the diverse range of music courses available throughout 
            Scotland; congratulates Edinburgh on securing the MTV Awards, to be 
            held in Leith later this year, and wishes the best of luck to all 
            Scottish nominees and participants.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-79#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Local Bus Routes 
            </strong>&#151;That the Parliament expresses concerns over powers 
            of deregulated bus operators to alter local bus routes without prior 
            consultation and notice to local communities; believes that it is 
            not acceptable that profitability is put before access in such cases; 
            is particularly concerned about the adverse effect of such changes 
            on older people, those with disabilities and parents with young children, 
            restricting their access to vital services and facilities; notes that 
            the negative experience of such changes in communities such as Bromhill, 
            Anderson and Townhead in Glasgow has resulted in community campaigns 
            to reinstate bus services; further notes that there is currently no 
            legal requirement for bus operators to consult members of the public 
            on the variation of bus routes and that bus operators are reluctant 
            to provide advance warning of changes owing to commercial sensitivities; 
            notes that there is no statutory duty for a strategic authority to 
            assess gaps created in bus services, and believes that measures should 
            be considered by the Parliament to create statutory duties on bus 
            operators to consult communities on proposed changes to local bus 
            routes and to ensure that bus operators serve hospitals and key services, 
            regardless of profitability.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-78</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Official Visit 
            by Delegates from the Palestinian Authority, 26-28 June 2003</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament welcomes the official visit to the Scottish Parliament 
            by a delegation from the Palestinian Authority from 26 to 28 June 
            2003, organised by the British Council; notes that the Palestinian 
            Authority is the official legislative body of the Palestinian people; 
            recognises that the development of democracy and administrative organisation 
            in the Palestinian Authority can benefit greatly from co-operation 
            of the Scottish Parliament and hopes that this visit will represent 
            only the beginning of a positive and practical relationship with the 
            Palestinian Authority; further recognises the extremely difficult 
            circumstances in which the Palestinian Authority must operate, particularly 
            the on-going occupation by the Israeli Defence Force; aspires to a 
            settled peace in the Middle East for both the Palestinian and Israeli 
            peoples; considers that the Road Map for Peace represents an opportunity 
            to establish an independent Palestinian state within three years; 
            insists that the Road Map for Peace process must be a genuine attempt 
            to meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people, including those 
            currently with no right of return to their homeland, and calls on 
            the Government of Israel to halt the building of illegal settlements 
            and withdraw from the occupied territories immediately.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-77 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Education (School Meals) (Scotland) Bill - Suspension of Standing 
            Orders</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that Rules 9.5.3A, 
            9.5.3B, 9.6.1, 9.6.2, 9.6.3, 9.6.4, 9.6.5, 9.6.6, 9.7.9, 9.8.3 and 
            9.10.4 of the Standing Orders be suspended for the purposes of the 
            Education (School Meals) (Scotland) Bill. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-76 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Education (School Meals) (Scotland) Bill - Electronic Voting</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament directs that under Rule 11.8.3 of the Standing Orders 
            any division at Stage 2 of the Education (School Meals) (Scotland) 
            Bill shall be conducted using the electronic voting system. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-75</strong> <strong>Campbell Martin: North Ayrshire 
            Leisure Limited</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns the action 
            of North Ayrshire Leisure Limited, a company formed, and primarily 
            funded, by North Ayrshire Council, in banning the Auchenharvie Ice 
            Dance and Figure Skating Club from operating a small tuck shop selling 
            "20p mixtures" of sweets and non-fizzy drinks, proceeds of which were 
            used to help fund the development of skating and ice dance talent 
            among young people in the north Ayrshire area; notes that this action 
            will mean that the club may now struggle to meet financial obligations 
            to its young members in terms of dance and skating development and 
            recognition of achievement, and deplores the fact that North Ayrshire 
            Leisure Limited appears to be putting profit before sporting development 
            by advising club members that they should instead use vending machines 
            selling over-priced and unhealthy chocolate bars and fizzy drinks.</p>
