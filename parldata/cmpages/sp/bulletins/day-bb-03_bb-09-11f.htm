            are able to provide alternative accommodation for children and families 
            currently held in detention; believes that such arrangements would 
            meet the requirements of UK asylum policy while being consistent with 
            United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees guidelines on alternatives 
            to detention; calls on Her Majesty's Government to meet appropriate 
            agencies to arrange for alternative provision of accommodation and 
            support and to fund this provision in Scotland, and welcomes the valuable 
            diversity which incomers, including asylum seekers and refugees, bring 
            to Scotland and the contribution they can make to our society.&quot;</P>
