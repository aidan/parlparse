<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4882</strong> <strong>Iain Smith:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Falkland in Bloom</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Burgh of Falkland for its success in being named best large village and best village overall in the Beautiful Scotland in Bloom awards 2006; further congratulates Falkland for its success in the Britain in Bloom competition in winning a gold award in the best large village category in the Britain in Bloom Award and winning the Community Award for the finalist deemed to have demonstrated that all sectors of the community have worked together as one and Falkland in Bloom Chairman, Keith Jackson, who won a personal commendation for his dedication to the Britain in Bloom cause, and wishes the community of Falkland every success in representing the United Kingdom in the 2007 Entente Florale European Competition.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4881</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>A Welcome Back for the Co-op Dividend</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Co-operative Group&rsquo;s new membership scheme which will extend membership of the business in Scotland to a projected 494,000 people by 2008 and 846,000 by 2012; notes that these members will share in the profits of the Co-operative Group, derived from a wide range of sectors from financial services to travel and food retail; further notes that members will be able to have a say in the business through involvement in its democratic structures; recognises the encouragement given to members to help their communities and campaign for a better world; commends the Co-op for its continued support for reducing food miles, ethical trading and local produce, and further welcomes its unwavering support for values such as self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality and solidarity and ethical values such as openness, honesty, social responsibility and caring for others.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4880</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Livestock Transport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the forthcoming implementation of the EU regulation on the welfare of animals during transportation from 5 January 2007; further notes that this regulation may require farmers who transport their own stock to pay more than &pound;400 to secure the necessary authorisation to move those animals; recognises that these welfare regulations are to be welcomed but that they put yet another financial and administrative burden on small farmers, including a requirement for anyone transporting animals over 65km to have a specific authorisation and, from 2008, an independent certificate of competence, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take advantage of the available derogations to ensure that the proposed administrative and financial burdens on individual farmers are reduced and also to encourage the building of small-scale local slaughter houses which will reduce transport time, improve animal welfare and create much-needed rural jobs.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4879</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Flawed Legislation on Ageism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the new equality legislation, to be implemented on 1 October 2006, is flawed with regard to ageism as it allows age discrimination against those aged 75 years and over as far as pensions are concerned; also notes that in both Westminster and Holyrood a parliamentarian aged over 75 years will not receive pension benefits equal to those received by under 75-year-olds, and considers that this is blatant ageism which makes a mockery of otherwise sound legislation.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4878</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Protection for Polish Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the support given by T&amp;G Scotland to migrant workers in recognising their role in Scotland and raising concern over the abuse of their rights; notes that Home Office figures show that 32,135 migrant workers are registered in Scotland, most of whom are Poles; notes with concern that migrant Polish workers are suffering abuse of tenancy rights, with immediate eviction of workers on termination of employment, extreme long hours, infringements on pay, rights to paid holidays, statutory sick pay and notice rights and rights to salary slips, and illegal deductions from wages; further notes that these migrant workers also face a number of challenges outwith the workplace, including language, opening bank accounts, religious issues and issues surrounding accommodation; recognises the positive contribution that migrant workers make to Scotland economically and culturally; further recognises that the abuse of these workers is indicative of the failed neo-liberal economic policies pursued by New Labour in London which destroy workers&rsquo; lives and communities, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to demand control of Scotland&rsquo;s economy and employment legislation from Westminster and to put pressure on employers to recognise workers&rsquo; rights with regards to pay and conditions and on all landlords to recognise tenants&rsquo; rights, irrespective of nationality.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4877</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Ministerial Statement on Right to Buy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the statement by the Minister for Communities on right to buy; notes that the statement is limited by being a statutory requirement under section 52 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, and supports longer-term and wider-ranging reform of right to buy, 26 years after its introduction, to make it appropriate for the 21st century housing landscape.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4876<> </strong> <strong>Mr John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Threat to the Rural Post Office Network in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the public concern over the future of the rural post office network in Perthshire, Angus and other parts of rural Scotland; notes that the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) provides a subsidy to the rural post office network in Scotland that is scheduled to be removed in 18 months&rsquo; time; notes that, while the DTI provides this subsidy, other UK government departments such as the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Transport and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are taking decisions that reduce the volume and value of transactions that can be undertaken at post offices, thereby damaging the profitability of these post offices; recognises that if the rural post office network is not supported there will be severe economic loss and loss of amenity in countless communities in Perthshire, Angus and rural Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the UK Government to provide a stable level of support that guarantees the viability of the rural post office network.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4875</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2006; notes that Breast Cancer Awareness Month is an annual national health campaign organised by the major breast cancer and cancer charities to increase awareness of the disease, raise funds for research into its cause, prevention and cure and offer vital information and support to those affected by it; notes also that the majority of breast cancers are detected by women who report unusual changes to their doctor but that only 43% of 55 to 64-year-olds check their breasts, which is worrying considering that this group is most at risk as the chances of developing breast cancer increase with age; notes that this is an indication that, despite the advances made in the treatment of breast cancer, women of the most potentially high risk are still not checking their breasts, showing that awareness is still a vital part of the fight against breast cancer, and commends all the organisations involved in continuing to try to get the message across that early detection is vital and checking your breasts regularly is part of the fight against cancer of the breast.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4874</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Integrated Care at the Vale of Leven Hospital</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is dismayed at the recent decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to end the Integrated Care Pilot at the Vale of Leven Hospital; believes that the staff involved, including nurses, GPs and consultants, have achieved much in developing a new model of care, lessons from which can be shared across Scotland; notes the NHS board&rsquo;s view that the problem with providing a continuing emergency service lies with an apparent lack of anaesthetists; considers that alternative options can be explored with a view to retaining anaesthetics&rsquo; cover; supports the need to retain a full range of services locally, including the coronary care unit, and calls on the board to reverse its decision to allow integrated care to be further developed in the interests of patient care.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4873</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Rome was Built on Seven Hills. Dufftown was Built on Seven Stills</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Speyside Autumn Whisky Festival held in Dufftown from 22 to 25 September 2006; notes the often repeated phrase &quot;Rome was built on seven hills.&nbsp; Dufftown was built on seven stills&quot; and the important role which Dufftown *and Speyside have played in making Moray globally recognised as the home of whisky*; recognises the vital jobs provided by the industry in distilleries, transportation and tourism, and congratulates the industry on achieving record levels of sales by capturing new markets, resulting in whisky contributing &pound;2 billion per year to the balance of trade.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4864.1</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4864) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, insert at end &quot;notes that the latest cost estimate to replace and maintain a new nuclear weapons system in place of Trident has reached an incredible &pound;76 billion, as indicated in House of Commons parliamentary answers; reaffirms its opposition to all nuclear weapons on grounds of morality and consistency with international law but notes that the economic arguments against replacing Trident are now also unanswerable; believes that &pound;76 billion committed over the next 30 years to wage war on poverty and grotesque inequality would concretely raise the quality and standard of life of all pensioners, children and families across the United Kingdom, and further believes that the latest astronomical cost estimate to replace Trident also adds political urgency to the cause of independence and that an independent, nuclear-free and socialist Scotland offers the best guarantee of peace and security for all Scotland&rsquo;s citizens.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4864.2</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4864) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, insert at end &quot;believes that the policy of nuclear deterrence is a failed policy; acknowledges that some countries believe that the only way they can protect themselves against British and American aggression is to acquire nuclear weaponry; believes that Scotland and other European countries will not be shielded from the effects of a limited nuclear war even if the US mainland is; is gravely concerned that the people of Scotland are forced, against their will, to live with a devastatingly destructive nuclear arsenal at Faslane, only 30 minutes&rsquo; drive from the centre of Glasgow; is further concerned that this nuclear base makes Scotland a target for a direct nuclear or terrorist strike; is opposed to the presence of nuclear warheads on Scottish soil; congratulates organisations such as Scottish CND and Trident Ploughshares on their campaigning for immediate, unilateral nuclear disarmament, and calls for the existing weapons of mass destruction located in Scotland to be scrapped immediately.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4864.3</strong> <strong>Euan Robson:</strong> <strong>Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4864) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;wishes to see the worldwide elimination of nuclear weapons; notes the UK Government&rsquo;s commitment, made in June 2005, to reach a decision on the replacement of the Trident system by the end of the current Westminster Parliament; further notes that the Secretary of State for Defence stated in June 2005 that &quot;no decision on any replacement for Trident has been taken, either in principle or otherwise&quot;; calls on the UK Government to ensure that there is a full public debate on the issue; further calls on the UK Government to press for a new round of multilateral arms reduction talks, and believes that the United Kingdom&rsquo;s current minimum nuclear deterrent should be retained for the foreseeable future until sufficient progress has been made towards the global elimination of nuclear weapons.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4864.4</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Trident</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4864) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, insert at end &quot;but also recognises the concerns of workforce unions, such as the GMB, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to prepare Scotland for a weapons of mass destruction-free future by producing a plan for the redeployment of workers, such as at Faslane and Coulport, for peaceful purposes.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4863.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Small Businesses</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4863) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;confirms&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that there is a need for government to create a business environment which will improve the competitiveness of Scottish small businesses; further believes that any detailed proposals to reduce the business rate burden for small businesses should be properly costed and the source of such monies identified; notes the impact of excessive regulation and poor levels of investment in infrastructure on the capacity of small businesses to grow; calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward policies to create a more business-friendly environment in Scotland, and notes that the introduction of a local income tax as proposed by the SNP and the Liberal Democrats would directly penalise hundreds of thousands of unincorporated small businesses throughout Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4863.2</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>Small Businesses</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4863) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;critically important&quot; to end and insert &quot;central role that small businesses play in delivering both economic growth and local services and welcomes the success that the Scottish Executive has had in supporting the growth in the total employment and overall number of small businesses and new business start-ups in Scotland since 1999; welcomes the benefit that small firms gain from a range of grant schemes that encourage the development of new products and processes, the creation or safeguarding of jobs and becoming more energy efficient, and also welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s Small Business Rates Relief Scheme that results in around 70% of non-domestic rate subjects in Scotland receiving rates relief of up to 50% and the decision to equalise the poundage with England from 1 April 2007, which demonstrates our determination to deliver the right conditions for all businesses to grow by encouraging yet more small business start-ups, creating more jobs, widening the tax base, increasing local economic activity and improving local services across Scotland.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4833*#*</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>School Bus Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that in certain local authority areas in Ayrshire and elsewhere there is a concern about the need to tighten up the rules and guidelines regarding the safety of buses carrying children to school and, in particular, believes that the regulations should be changed so that it is mandatory for a supervising adult to accompany primary school children travelling on a school bus whether the bus is a single or double decker.</p>
