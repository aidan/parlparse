<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>

<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the<a href="#end"> end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">current motions</a> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7756&diams; </strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Healthy Living Centres and Community Empowerment</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the work of healthy living centres such as the Annexe in Partick, Glasgow, in their promotion of community-led approaches to health improvement in disadvantaged communities; notes the publication of <em>Health in Scotland 2009 Time for Change: Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer,</em> which suggests a more community-based approach to health promotion that focuses on empowering people in society to cope with everyday stresses as opposed to the current deficit-model of healthcare which, the report argues, tends to produce high levels of dependence on hospital and welfare services; believes that healthy living centres have been hugely successful in promoting the self-empowerment of local communities, allowing them to identify and respond to their specific needs; believes that, in turn, this increases the sense of health and wellbeing in communities and decreases their reliance on external support, and would welcome proposals being brought forward to ensure that healthy living centres remain at the heart of community empowerment.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7755</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Don&rsquo;t Limit Mobility</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the report, <em>Don&rsquo;t limit mobility,</em> by the organisations Leonard Cheshire Disability, Mencap, Sense and others in response to the UK Government&rsquo;s proposal to stop paying the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance for disabled people in residential care; expresses its concern that the removal of the mobility component for disabled people in residential care might force people to remain indoors, have a diminished quality of life and greatly reduce their independence, autonomy and opportunities, and strongly urges the UK Government to reverse this decision.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7754</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Mountain Rescue Debt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on the UK Government to treat mountain rescue teams fairly and refund or remove VAT from mountain rescue services, which is estimated to cost teams in Scotland between &pound;150,000 and &pound;200,000 per year; notes that, on 4 May 2010, two days before the UK election, Danny Alexander said that, as part of the debt owed to mountain rescue teams, they should be refunded their VAT; believes that the UK Government owes mountain rescue teams more than a debt, it owes them hundreds of thousands of pounds in VAT, and calls on the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, to deliver for Scotland&rsquo;s mountain rescue teams and provide them with a VAT refund.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-7753</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Lollipop Legend</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Bryan Warren on winning Scotland&rsquo;s Lollipop Person of the Year Award; understands that the children at Jamestown Primary School describe him as the &quot;best lollipop man in the universe&quot;; commends him for donating his prize money to the Vale Of Leven Remembrance Day Association, of which he is the chairman, and further congratulates him for his dedication and commitment to the safety of the children at Jamestown Primary School.</p>
