<!-- #BeginEditable "Body%20text" --> <p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle 
(<img src="../../committees/cte_graphics/delta.gif" width="15" height="13">) 
are initiated by the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of 
information to the Parliament.</strong></p><p><STRONG>S1W-33940</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr 
Brian Monteith:</STRONG> To ask the Scottish Executive when the Scottish Arts 
Council&#146;s Youth Music Audit will be published.</p><P><STRONG>S1W-33941</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Michael Russell:</STRONG> To ask the Scottish Executive what arrangements

<STRONG>Michael Russell:</STRONG> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the

the use of the quotation contained in that answer, taken from an article of mine 
in <EM>The Herald</EM> on 22 October 2001, and intended to show support for the 
stance taken by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport on the national theatre 
and its funding, was complete without including the next sentence in the article, 
&quot;But, equally, to invest in existing theatre and leave the national theatre 
plan hanging in the air where it has been for the past decade or more would indicate 
no ambition for Scottish arts and culture and no commitment to making progress&quot;, 
and whether the use of the quotation in that manner by the First Minister was 
contrary to the founding principles of the Parliament.</P><P><STRONG>S1W-33943</STRONG>

whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) has been kept fully aware

now carry out a review in respect of these matters.</P><P><STRONG>S1W-33946</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Fergus Ewing:</STRONG> To ask the Presiding Officer, further to his answer 
to question S1W-18874 on 12 October 2001, whether any further work has been carried 
out by other contractors on (a) work initially carried out by Flour City Architectural 
Metals (UK) Ltd (FCAM) and (b) design and specialist cladding services provided

and (ii) the total cost of such services.</P><P><STRONG>S1W-33947</STRONG> <STRONG>Fergus 
Ewing:</STRONG> To ask the Presiding Officer which works package contracts let 
in relation to the Holyrood project have (a) been completed and (b) not been completed 
and what the reasons are for any such contracts not having been completed; what

uncompleted contracts, and what the estimated date of completion is of each such

the Presiding Officer, with regard to paragraphs 6 and 7 of <EM>The 2001/02 Audit

<STRONG>Fergus Ewing:</STRONG> To ask the Presiding Officer, with regard to paragraph 
14 of <EM>The 2001/02 Audit of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body</EM> 
by the Auditor General for Scotland, when the construction managers were first 
alerted by any member, employee or representative of the Bovis group of companies 
to any problems and difficulties in respect of the Canary Wharf project that was 
undertaken by Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd (FCAM) and terminated in 
August 2001; whether information received in respect of this matter was passed 
on to any member of the Holyrood project team, the Holyrood Progress Group or 
the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and, if so, on what date, and whether, 
prior to award of the contract, references were received from any other member 
of the Bovis group and, if so, from which member and in respect of which other 
contracts undertaken by FCAM or any other member of the Flour City International 
group of companies.</P><P><STRONG>S1W-33950</STRONG> <STRONG>Dorothy-Grace Elder:</STRONG>
