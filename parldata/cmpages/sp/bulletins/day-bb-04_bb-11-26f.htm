          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2076#</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes:</strong> <strong>Network Rail GSM-R Masts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the erection by Network Rail of 29 metre-high Global System for Mobile Telecommunications (GSM-R) masts throughout Scotland, beginning with a pilot programme of 84 masts in the Strathclyde area; acknowledges that, despite giving assurances that communities would be fully informed in advance of any work, Network Rail has erected several masts with little or no prior direct notification to elected representatives or local residents; asks Network Rail to give an absolute assurance that masts erected using permitted development rights will not be used at any point for commercial purposes, and acknowledges that, whilst rail safety must always be paramount, the Scottish Executive should examine Network Rail&rsquo;s permitted development rights in relation to GSM-R masts and, in particular, the role that both Network Rail and local authorities should play in consulting local residents.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2075</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Oakbank Awarded Scottish School of Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Oakbank School in Aberdeen which is today celebrating being named Scottish School of the Year by the Scottish Qualifications Authority; sends its best wishes to all those staff and pupils whose efforts have resulted in this award, and recognises their dedication and commitment to helping young people, who are facing significant challenges, translate negative educational experiences into positive ones.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2074</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>The Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Health Committee recommends that the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (East Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) Order 2004 (SSI 2004/500) be approved.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Rhona Brankin<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2073#</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Tackling the Impact of Misuse of Alcohol</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, in the light of the major influence which misuse of alcohol has on many issues of great concern to it, such as violence in the home and in the streets, knife crime, sectarian and racial violence and abuse, misbehaviour at and around football matches, hate crimes and ill-health, believes that the Scottish Executive, while working on bringing forward a comprehensive Licensing Bill, should actively pursue bringing together the various proof-of-age card schemes into an effective voluntary national scheme and should encourage the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to enforce more vigorously existing legislation on adults not buying alcohol for under-age people and on the offence of serving alcohol to someone who is already drunk.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2072#</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Lifting the Over Thirty Months Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) was introduced around eight years ago to protect the public against the potential risk that humans consuming beef which is over 30 months might contract CJD via BSE-infected beef; acknowledges that the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which was set up in order to provide an independent source of scientific advice on food safety, recommended in July 2003 that the scheme be scrapped and the ban lifted and replaced by a two-stage process, involving testing of animals for BSE, advice which was reaffirmed in July 2004; expresses concern that the FSA&rsquo;s advice has not been acted upon by the UK Government and devolved ministers; understands that the cost of the OTMS exceeds &pound;400 million a year, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should lift the ban as soon as practically possible in order that public money can be used directly for the health service or other priorities, and not be wasted on a scheme which is, according to the official food safety watchdog, no longer justified.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2071</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Burns Monument Kilmarnock</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance and value of life over property and sends its best wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the two Strathclyde firefighters who sustained serious injuries in their efforts to control the fire on Friday morning at the Burns Monument, Kilmarnock and to their families; calls on all politicians to support East Ayrshire Council in its efforts to recover the site so that its significance as an historical landmark in Kilmarnock, which is dear to the people of Kilmarnock and Loudoun and those across the world with a connection to Kilmarnock and Burns, can be retained.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Bill Butler<strong>*</strong>, Elaine Smith<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong>, Cathy Peattie<strong>*</strong>, Paul Martin<strong>*</strong>, Donald Gorrie<strong>*</strong>, Helen Eadie<strong>*</strong>, Scott Barrie<strong>*</strong>, Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Janis Hughes<strong>*</strong>, Bristow Muldoon<strong>*</strong>, Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong>, Christine May<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2070#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Rascarrel Bay Hutters</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the position within Scots law of hutters in places such as Rascarrel Bay in Galloway, where their legal position as regards tenure allows landowners to impose very large rent increases; notes that the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s position of encouraging local discussions does not work in practice in situations where one party is not willing to enter into negotiations, and considers that the Executive should re-examine its position with a view to implementing a suitable level of protection in law for hutters in Scotland.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>S2M-2067</strong> <strong>Timetabling of Sewel Motions</strong> (lodged on 24 November 2004) Elaine Smith<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2067.1</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Timetabling of Sewel Motions</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2067) in the name of Donald Gorrie, insert at end &quot;as a first step to bringing to an end the use of this undemocratic mechanism and ensure that the Scottish Parliament makes all decisions on matters devolved to it until such time as we have a Parliament with all the full powers of an independent nation state.&quot;</p>

          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2064.1</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Doctors&rsquo; Responsibility to the Public Sector</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2064) in the name of Dr Jean Turner, leave out from &quot;and calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;further believes that the private health sector leeches off the NHS in terms of its provision of publicly-trained professionals and the transfer of public money for private profit, that private health provision is inconsistent with the vision of a comprehensive, universal, national health service free at the point of need, and believes that the Scottish Executive is participating in a sustained and fundamental London-led strategy to undermine and dismantle the NHS and that the future of the NHS is dependent on the reversal of all forms of privatisation and requires radical strategies to increase its capacity directly.&quot;</p>
