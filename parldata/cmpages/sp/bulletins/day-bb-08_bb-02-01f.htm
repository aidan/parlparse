<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on   which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments   lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin   every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the   forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment   is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first   published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this   section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the   Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not   yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol   (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with   an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been   withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1281</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>50th Anniversary of   Scottish CND</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Campaign   for Nuclear Disarmament on the occasion of its 50th anniversary; notes that the   UK Government&rsquo;s plan to renew and replace Trident would have an impact on   matters devolved to the Scottish Parliament for the next 50 years; expresses   concern that the UK Government is spending &pound;2.7 billion at Aldermaston over the   next three years; urges the majority of Scottish Westminster MPs of all parties   who voted against Trident renewal on 14 March 2007 to continue their opposition   to that policy at Westminster with a view to overturning it in due course, and   supports the 50th anniversary rally which will be held at Aldermaston on 24   March 2008.</p>
<p>Supported by: Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1280</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Access to Work for   Young Deaf People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that all young people   should have equal access to employment on leaving school or further and higher   education; agrees that a modern Scotland should embrace a diverse workforce;   welcomes the presence of the STUC in the Scottish Parliament earlier this month,   when a workshop was held to discuss issues relating to access to work for deaf   people; recognises the good work that the STUC is undertaking in partnership   with trade unions and employers in the Highlands to provide training sessions in   deaf awareness and British Sign Language (BSL); is aware however that key   voluntary organisations such as the National Deaf Children&rsquo;s Society (NDCS), the   Scottish Council on Deafness and the Royal National Institute for Deaf People   are still generally finding that there are significant barriers for young deaf   people and adults to access employment or training opportunities, including work   experience, due to communication barriers and lack of deaf awareness in the   workplace; notes that the UK Government&rsquo;s Access to Work<em> </em>scheme, while   providing for access to appropriate communication during working hours, does not   cover such access for training provision, which is crucial to an employee&rsquo;s   induction and professional development; is further concerned that there is an   acute shortage of qualified BSL interpreters in Scotland, meaning that many deaf   people in the workplace cannot access even the minimum level of communication   support that they are entitled to; welcomes the work of the NDCS, who have been   supporting deaf young people to make the transition from school into the world   of work via its Moving On<em> </em>project, and, while welcoming the Scottish   Government&rsquo;s intention to increase the number of qualified BSL interpreters in   Scotland, considers that the Scottish Government should liaise with the UK   Government, where appropriate, to ensure better access to employment and   training and increased promotion of deaf awareness in the workplace, for the   benefit of deaf young people and adults alike.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1279</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Congratulations   to Dakota Bar and Grill, Restaurant of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament   congratulates the Dakota Bar and Grill in South Queensferry on being voted Best   Hotel Restaurant and Restaurant of the Year in the first Scottish Restaurant   Awards; acknowledges the importance of tourism and high-quality facilities to   the local economy, and commends the Dakota for its use of locally sourced   produce.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1278</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Effective Energy   Complaint Handling</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the changes in   consumer representation and complaint handling that take effect from the end of   September 2008 will require energy suppliers to take additional responsibility   for resolving their own complaints; further notes that suppliers will have to   adhere to a new statutory complaint-handling standard; recognises the need for   Ofgem to ensure that a new standard gives a clear signal to suppliers that their   complaint-handling functions must be accessible to all consumers and believes   that company complaints data should be subject to independent verification,   without which there are likely to be concerns about data quality, transparency   and insufficient incentives on companies to invest in improving their customer   service, and calls on the Scottish Government to make representations to the   Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to ensure   that, before the standard is approved, it contains provisions that companies   must provide their complaints data to the new consumer advocacy body and Ofgem   and that this data will be subject to independent audit to allow consumers to   compare companies&rsquo; customer service performance.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1277</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Magazine Wins   Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s   bi-monthly publication, <em>Glasgow</em>, the magazine for residents and   businesses, edited by John Keil, on being voted Customer Magazine of the Year at   the prestigious Periodical Publishers Association&rsquo;s Scottish Magazine Awards   2007 for the second year running.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1276#</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Borderline   Homelessness Charity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the great work done   by the Borderline charity in supporting homeless Scots in London, which despite   having only five staff members has helped many homeless Scots in London to find   accommodation, return to Scotland, begin work or training and support them in   the many other difficulties facing those who find themselves on the streets, and   hopes that as we approach Poverty Action Sunday, the culmination of Poverty   Action and Homelessness Week 2008, everyone will take the opportunity to reflect   on the plight of the poor and homeless in Scotland and help work towards a   fairer and more prosperous Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1274</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Keeping Accident and   Emergency Services Local</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the recent   decision by NHS Lanarkshire to retain full accident and emergency services at   Monklands Hospital; further welcomes the NHS board&rsquo;s commitment to move towards   the delivery of the new Airdrie health centre, the Monklands mental health unit   and the Lanarkshire cancer centre; notes that none of this would have been   possible had an SNP Government not been returned at the elections in May;   condemns the previous administration&rsquo;s attempt to push through an ill-thought   out proposal against the express wishes of the people who elected it; notes that   majority medical opinion supports the retention of Monklands accident and   emergency, and congratulates the residents of Lanarkshire for their long and   hard-fought campaign to keep their accident and emergency services   local.</p>
<strong> </strong>
<p><strong>*S3M-1273</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>VAT for Warm   Homes Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the campaign by Energy   Action Scotland proposing that the extra VAT generated by recent and further   domestic energy price rises, estimated to bring in an additional &pound;175 million to   the exchequer purse, should be redistributed across the four constituent   countries of the United Kingdom for the exclusive purpose of tackling fuel   poverty which would provide much-needed assistance to the 700,000 households in   Scotland, one in three, living in fuel poverty.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1271#</strong> <strong>Elaine Murray:</strong> <strong>Hunting of Wild   Boar with Dogs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is very concerned by reports in the <em>Sunday Times</em> of 27 January 2008 that commercial hunting of wild boar   with dogs is being organised on an estate in Dumfries and Galloway; is further   concerned that such activity may cause suffering to both the boar and dogs   concerned, and believes that the legality of such activity should be   investigated and that, if the hunting of wild boar with dogs is permitted under   current legislation, legislation should be introduced to ban such   activity.</p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1270</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Closure of Telephone   Boxes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the plans by BT to close   telephone boxes in Scotland; notes with particular concern the impact that this   might have in rural areas where populations are sparse and mobile phone   reception is patchy; calls on Ofcom to make sure that no residents or travellers   could be put in danger through lack of emergency phones; calls for a national   plan to be drawn up by the regulator and BT before any further telephone box   closures are proposed, including consideration of options such as cashless or   emergency only boxes for those deemed essential, and urges Ofcom to consult all   the affected communities to gain their support.</p>
