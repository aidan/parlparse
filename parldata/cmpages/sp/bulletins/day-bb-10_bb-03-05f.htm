                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5887 Cathy Jamieson: Congratulations to Amy Kinnaird</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Amy Kinnaird of Ochiltree on the publication of <em>Mair Stravaigin</em>, a collection of articles that previously appeared in <em>Scottish Home and Country</em> and have been reproduced with permission of the Scottish Women&rsquo;s Rural Institutes; thanks her for recording and keeping alive many local stories and customs from across Ayrshire; thanks her for her contribution to local walking groups and Ayr Opportunities in Retirement, and wishes her well for future stravaigin.</p>

                                        <p> <strong>*S3M-5886 Johann Lamont: Michael Foot</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with great sadness the passing of Michael Foot (1913-2010) at the age of 96; recognises his dedication to the Labour Party, the Labour movement, the cause of socialism and to British parliamentary democracy; acknowledges his lifelong and inspirational commitment to peace and justice, giving voice to those who opposed apartheid in South Africa, to those who fought injustice at home and across the world, and in championing British unilateral nuclear disarmament; considers that he made a huge contribution as a minister and as the leader of the Labour Party in fighting tirelessly during times of a global energy crisis and domestic economic breakdown to protect the most vulnerable; recognises that Michael Foot was a man deeply passionate about politics, literature and learning, devoted to the Labour Party and his beloved Plymouth Argyle FC, and considers that he fought tirelessly for his values and beliefs, was one of the most eloquent speakers to ever grace the House of Commons, that his legacy, in word and action, speaks to a life well lived in the service of others and that this finest of examples of a politician of honesty, decency, integrity, humanity and compassion will be sadly missed.</p>

                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5884 Kenneth Gibson: The Completeness and Accuracy of Electoral Registers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Electoral Commission report, <em>The completeness and accuracy of electoral registers in Great Britain</em>, which provides snap shots of electoral registers in eight local authorities, including Glasgow and South Ayrshire; recognises the issue of low voter registration, particularly among young people between 17 and 24 years of age, ethnic minorities and those who have recently changed address; considers that there is room for modernization of the system, such as moving the annual canvass, currently held in autumn, closer to elections; commends the Electoral Commission&rsquo;s campaigns specifically targeting groups less likely to register, and urges Scottish authorities to follow its example, particularly in light of elections this year and next, in order to better serve the Scottish people.</p>

Get over it!, which has been taken up by the Edinburgh Community Safety Partnership in collaboration with Stonewall Scotland to stress that homophobic and transphobic hate crime will not be tolerated; encourages people who are the victims of homophobic hate crimes to report them to the police; further welcomes the Lothian and Borders Police Safer Communities Department&rsquo;s commitment not to tolerate any sort of discrimination in Edinburgh and its stated pride in the city&rsquo;s multicultural communities, and supports the view that all forms of bullying are unacceptable and have no place in Scottish society.</p>
