<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Education&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S2M-4464</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that creating a greater degree of school autonomy, devolving more powers to head teachers and giving greater say to parents and teachers in shaping the education system will raise standards; is therefore disappointed at the abolition of school boards which will dilute parental representation in schools; notes that Jordanhill School, Scotland&rsquo;s only remaining independently run but publicly funded school, has consistently been among the top-performing schools in Scotland and won the SQA &quot;School of the Year&quot; award; notes that teaching unions are voicing concerns over the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s discipline and mainstreaming policies, and calls on the Executive to introduce reforms to create a more diverse education system in Scotland to raise standards, tackle discipline and serve the needs and aspirations of all pupils. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S2M-4464.2</strong> <strong>Robert Brown: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4464) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert&nbsp;&quot;applauds the fact that the Scottish education system is recognised by international benchmarking exercises as being amongst the best in the world; recognises the commitment of the Scottish Executive to sustained improvement in education and the biggest school buildings modernisation programme in our history, unprecedented stability in industrial relations and increased numbers of teachers and classroom assistants; welcomes the educational legislation which has, for example, established a more individual and supportive framework for children with additional support needs and increased the opportunities for parental involvement in education; notes that the top performing schools in Scotland have served a wide variety of communities and congratulates all the winners of the SQA &quot;School of the Year&quot; Award; welcomes the measured comments of the EIS in relation to discipline policies of the Scottish Executive, and&nbsp;believes that the model for continued improvement for Scottish schools should build on current strength and success and tackle known challenges by fostering the leadership skills of head teachers and other teaching staff, reforming the curriculum, widening choice and reducing unnecessary paperwork, ensuring that teachers are freed up to teach, and pupils to learn, all with a view to equipping young people with the skills and values needed in the modern world.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S2M-4464.1</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4464) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports greater choice within schools, rather than between schools, in order that pupils can benefit from breadth in the curriculum and believes that the agenda for education in Scotland should be focussed on raising the levels of achievement for all and should include a review of the deployment of education resources at school level against the national resources provided, an analysis of over-assessment in schools and policies to drive forward the pursuit of excellence.&quot; </p>
