          <p><strong>*S2M-1038</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>The 
            Draft Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 (Modification of 
            Enactments) Order 2004</strong>&#8212;That the Health Committee recommends 
            that the Draft Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 (Modification 
            of Enactments) Order 2004 be approved.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1037</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Retention 
            of Recommended Retail Price</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament supports 
            the campaign by the Writers&#8217; Guild of Great Britain, the Society 
            of Authors, J K Rowling and other writers to maintain the recommended 
            retail price (RRP) on books; recognises the importance of the cultural 
            industries to Scotland and the fact that discounting prices on books 
            means that writers receive less income and therefore will find it 
            harder to survive, and therefore calls on the Scottish Publishers 
            Association to require all its members to retain the RRP.<strong><em>R</em></strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1036</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Adoption 
            of Fair Trade Policy by the Salvation Army</strong>&#8212;That the 
            Parliament notes the intention of the Salvation Army to mark the 10th 
            anniversary of the Fair Trade movement by working towards a Fair Trade 
            policy covering all its centres; further notes that this Christian 
            organisation serves a cup of tea or coffee every 30 seconds and is 
            the largest provider of care, second only to the government, and congratulates 
            the Salvation Army for providing a positive example which is consistent 
            with its Christian outlook and encourages other organisations to follow 
            its lead.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1035</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Proposed 
            Closure of Midlothian Primary Schools</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament 
            expresses concern at the proposed closure of five Midlothian primary 
            schools and requests that the statutory consultation period of 28 
            days be extended to enable local communities to fully explore and 
            comment on the proposals.<strong><em>R</em></strong></p>

          <p><strong>*S2M-1034</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Holyrood 
            Inquiry</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament agrees to hold a debate 
            on the Holyrood Inquiry and, in relation to this debate, agrees that 
            under section 23 of the Scotland Act, 1998, the producers and commissioning 
            body for the planned BBC Scotland programme &quot;The Gathering Place&quot;

            an amendment to motion (S2M-1033) in the name of Mr Frank McAveety, 
            insert at end &quot;and believes that Historic Scotland, in its policies, 
            must be mindful of the immense benefits to employment, income and 
            culture brought by tourism and, in particular, art and archaeological 
            tourism.&quot;</p>

            an amendment to motion (S2M-1033) in the name of Mr Frank McAveety,

            by individuals and organisations, there remain serious concerns about 
            (a) a lack of both resources and information and (b) the failure to 
            sufficiently protect, conserve, interpret and promote Scotland&#8217;s

            environment backed up by a regular audit to measure progress.&quot;</p>

            Poverty</strong>&#8212;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1020) in the

            increases in means testing for pensioners introduced by the Chancellor 
            of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, adversely affect many pensioners who 
            are reluctant to claim the benefits to which they are entitled; supports 
            the re-introduction of a link between pensions and earnings as proposed 
            by the Conservative Party at Westminster, and recognises that a growing, 
            dynamic economy through lower tax and regulation is the best way to

            congratulates the Scottish Executive for closing the opportunity gap 
            for Scotland&#8217;s poorest pensioners; welcomes Executive policies 
            that are helping pensioners to save money on heating their homes effectively, 
            providing assistance with bus fares and continuing free personal and 
            nursing care, and supports the Executive in encouraging pensioners 
            to claim benefits that are rightfully theirs, such as council tax 
            benefit, through the central heating programme, and through disseminating 
            information to local authorities and old people&#8217;s organisations.&quot;</p>
