                                        <p> <strong>*S3M-5593 Sarah Boyack: Conversion Needed for Scottish Rugby Coverage</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that there are significant gaps in broadcast coverage in Scotland of rugby, particularly on terrestrial television and particularly around the community game and high performance professional teams; is disappointed that despite the  strenuous efforts of Scottish Rugby there is little interest to broadcast the sport sufficiently on either terrestrial or satellite television, and, finally,&nbsp;considers that the broadcasting of rugby is essential to further increase participation in the sport thus increasing fitness levels, promoting Scotland to a wider audience and creating a platform for greater Scottish sporting achievements.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5592 Robert Brown: Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland Fostering and Adoption Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Fostering Network has calculated that Scotland needs an extra 1,700 carers; notes research from Barnardo&rsquo;s indicating that people in Scotland are the least likely to consider fostering and that a perceived lack of training and support is the most common reason for this; recognises the dedication of Scotland&rsquo;s foster carers; believes that fostering not only provides a loving home for some of the most vulnerable children in Scotland but can also be immensely rewarding to those who foster; welcomes the launch of Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland Fostering and Adoption Week on 18 January 2010 as one of a range of initiatives that will encourage more Scots to consider fostering, and congratulates Barnardo&rsquo;s Scotland Fostering service in Glasgow for the work that it does in finding placements for children under the age of 13 with emotional and behavioural difficulties and for the training and support that it offers foster carers and potential foster carers.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5591 Christina McKelvie: Stop the Traffik</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the work of Stop the Traffik, the international campaign against people trafficking; notes that people trafficking is a growing concern, with up to an estimated four million men, women and children being trafficked across borders and within their own countries every year; joins Stop the Traffik&rsquo;s 1,000 member organisations in 50 countries worldwide in condemning the outrage of this ongoing enslavement of human beings; further notes the reported success that Stop the Traffik has had in forcing Cadbury, Mars and Nestl&eacute; to reduce the amount of chocolate that they use from C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, where thousands of children whom have been trafficked are used to harvest the cocoa beans that make over a third of the world&rsquo;s chocolate; endorses the campaigns at <a href="http://www.stopthetraffik.org" target="_blank">www.stopthetraffik.org</a> to encourage confectionary manufacturers to increase their use of certified fairly traded cocoa beans, to encourage business travellers to learn how to recognise and report incidences of trafficking and to raise awareness of the dangers of the 2012 Olympic Games being used as an opportunity by people traffickers, and congratulates the Rev John Carswell and his colleagues at Cadzow Parish Church in Hamilton on organising a fundraising and awareness-raising concert in aid of Stop the Traffik, which will take place on the evening of 20 February 2010.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5590 David Whitton: Graduates for Business Scheme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the decision by Scottish Enterprise to scrap the Graduates for Business scheme with the loss of seven jobs; considers that the decision to cut the graduate employment scheme was made by Scottish Enterprise purely on cost grounds despite the programme being viewed as a great success by employer organisations: notes that 250 flexible graduate internships were arranged annually with two thirds of participants offered permanent posts after being on the programme, and calls on Scottish Enterprise to act on the open letter from the UK Commission for Employment and Skills to invest in the future of Scotland&rsquo;s young people and reinstate the graduate programme as a matter of urgency.</p>
                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5589 Robin Harper: Bee Research, Monoculture and Allotments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of research by the French National Institute for Agronomic Research, based in Avignon, proving for the first time that a more diverse diet of different kinds of pollen can boost bee immunity; considers that this suggests that modern intensive monoculture farming is one of at least three major factors contributing to the alarming rates of decline in bee numbers across Europe, amounting in the United Kingdom to a 20% loss in the 2008-09 winter period, and calls on the Scottish Government to work, in this, the international year of biodiversity, to see what improvements in biodiversity can be made through assistance to large-scale farming and extra assistance to small-scale and organic farming and, in particular, encouragement to local authorities to persuade them to open up land for allotment development in order to address this serious problem and halt the decline in honey and bumblebees that afflicts the countryside at present.</p>
                                        <p><strong>S3M-5562 Hugh Henry: School Transport in Renfrewshire</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with regret the decision by Renfrewshire Council to remove school transport from almost 1,000 secondary school pupils; believes that this will endanger many pupils and diminish their education; notes the decision of the council to reward top officials with an extra &pound;321,000 in June 2008, and believes that the salaries of these officials should be cut back to help pay for the *&pound;274,000 needed in the next financial year* to maintain school transport in Renfrewshire at existing levels.</p>

                                        <p><strong>*S3M-5536.1 Elaine Smith: Breaking the Circle of Violence: Scared to Go Home</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5536) in the name of John Wilson, leave out from &quot;praises&quot; to end and insert &quot;understands, however, that this is overwhelmingly a crime of male violence against women and children with 88% of crimes and offences of domestic abuse and 95% of crimes of indecency, which are mostly crimes of sexual assault, being perpetrated by men against women, making it clearly a gender issue and an exploitation of power.&quot;</p>
