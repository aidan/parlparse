          <p><strong>*S1M-2684#</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie: Draft Guidance on the Circumstances 
            in which Parents may Choose to Educate their Children at Home</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive's consultation on the 
            draft <em>Guidance on the Circumstances in which Parents may Choose 
            to Educate their Children at Home</em>; believes that this will provide 
            an opportunity for the views of children and parents, who clearly 
            have concerns about the content of the draft guidance, to be taken 
            into account, and further believes that the right to choose education 
            outwith school should be facilitated with due respect for data protection 
            and human rights legislation and that the guidance should not discriminate 
            unreasonably between those children who have never attended and those 
            who are removed from state schools.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2683</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Scottish Veterans of the International 
            Brigade</strong>-That the Parliament offers warm greetings to the very 
            small band of Scottish veterans of the British Battalion of the International 
            Brigade; notes that they and their late Scottish comrades formed a 
            full 25% of the British Battalion; acknowledges their courage and 
            radical determination to assist the democratically elected Spanish 
            Government in stemming the ugly tide of fascism so many years ago, 
            at a time when some European governments sought to appease the fascists 
            in Spain, Germany and Italy; recalls that these Scottish veterans, 
            along with other veterans of the International Brigade, were honoured 
            by the Spanish Government on the 60th Anniversary of the Spanish Civil 
            War with honorary Spanish citizenship, and offers its best wishes 
            to these distinguished Scottish veterans of a distant war against 
            fascism.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2682</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: The Co-op and Labelling in Braille</strong>-That 
            the Parliament commends the Co-operative Society (Co-op) on the introduction 
            of labelling in braille for products sold in its retail stores and 
            shops; believes that this initiative will be welcomed by blind and 
            partially-sighted customers of the Co-op, and urges other large retailers 
            to follow the example set by the Co-op in providing this kind of assistance 
            to such members of the community, whose needs are too often ignored.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2681</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Rural Postal Services</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the decision by the Postal Services Commission 
            to bring an end to Royal Mail's monopoly over letter deliveries; expresses 
            its concern over the threat that this may pose to postal services 
            in rural areas, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to do all that 
            it can in order to ensure that these services are protected.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2680</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Funds Paid to the Third Age Group</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with grave concern the most recent allegations 
            regarding links between the constituency office of former First Minister 
            Henry McLeish in Glenrothes and the Third Age Group and regarding 
            the payment of £40,000 in grants by Fife Council to the charity for 
            two years after it ceased to exist; believes that, once again, activities 
            in the constituency of the former First Minister are likely to cast 
            a shadow over his activity as a member of the Scottish Parliament, 
            and calls for an independent inquiry into relations between Fife Council, 
            the Third Age Group and the former First Minister's constituency office 
            in order to determine who was responsible for granting such funds 
            to the Third Age Group and what they were used for.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2679</strong> <strong>Iain Gray: The Draft Town and Country Planning 
            (Fees for Applications and Deemed Applications) (Scotland) Amendment 
            Regulations 2002</strong>-That the Transport and the Environment Committee 
            recommends that the draft Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications 
            and Deemed Applications) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2002 be 
            approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2678</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: Community Care and Health 
            (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the Community 
            Care and Health (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Hugh Henry<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2677</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Widening Access Accolade 
            for Stirling and other Universities</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the University of Stirling on coming first in <em>The Times Higher 
            Education Supplement's</em> &quot;Access Elite&quot; list of universities 
            in the UK that perform best at widening access to pupils from poorer 
            backgrounds, based on four criteria, namely (a) inclusive access, 
            (b) low dropout rates, (c) quality of teaching and (d) research and 
            applauds the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow School of Art, Heriot-Watt 
            University and the University of Dundee for taking the next four places 
            to give Scotland a clean sweep of the UK's top five higher education 
            institutions in this survey.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Keith Harding<strong>*</strong>, Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong>, 
            Alex Johnstone<strong>*</strong>, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2676</strong> <strong>Mr Keith Harding: Freemasons</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the declaration of Mr Keith Harding MSP as a Freemason in the 
            register of members' interests on 31 January 2002 and encourages all 
            other MSPs who are members of the craft, a body of men dedicated to 
            charitable good works, to make similar voluntary declarations in support 
            of the Consultative Steering Group's principles of openness, accountability 
            and transparency.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2675</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie: Water Industry (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees that the Water Industry (Scotland) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2674</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Budget (Scotland) (No.3) Bill</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees that the Budget (Scotland) (No.3) Bill be passed.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jack McConnell<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jim Wallace<strong>*</strong>, 
            Patricia Ferguson<strong>*</strong>, Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2673</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: OECD <em>Programme for International 
            Student Assessment: Scottish Report</em></strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            the OECD <em>Programme for International Student Assessment: Scottish 
            Report </em>which confirmed that Scotland's young people have the potential 
            to be the best in the world in terms of school attainment but that 
            they have not yet reached that position; congratulates students and 
            teachers on their performance in the light of continual interference 
            from a Scottish Executive which is not meeting its own targets in 
            education, and notes that the report specifically states that &quot;the 
            performance in reading literacy of students (at age 15) varied substantially 
            with the amount of time they read for enjoyment&quot;, thus confirming 
            the importance of enjoyment and personal satisfaction in educational 
            attainment in contrast to imposing the treadmill of over-assessment 
            which remains the Scottish Executive's policy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2672</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Mansfield Place Church</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the Mansfield Traquair Trust for its 
            success to date in restoring the fabric of the Catholic Apostolic 
            Church at Mansfield Place, Edinburgh, which is an excellent example 
            of romanesque style by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson and home to the 
            most uplifting, scintillating and luminescent murals from the arts 
            and craft movement by Phoebe Anna Traquair, completed in 1901, but 
            now, sadly, in great need of careful restoration; notes that the Scottish 
            Council for Voluntary Organisations has already agreed a long term 
            lease to use the building as its new headquarters, thereby providing 
            a secure basis for the future, and calls upon Historic Scotland, national 
            lottery organisations and other public agencies to continue to give 
            the Mansfield Traquair Trust every assistance so that the building 
            and its superior decorative illuminations are available for the enjoyment 
            of the Scottish people and art lovers world-wide.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2671</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Perth Bid for New SNH Headquarters</strong>-That 
            the Parliament recognises that Scottish Natural Heritage intends to 
            move its headquarters out of Edinburgh; notes previous commitments 
            by the Scottish Executive on the dispersion of civil service and other 
            public sector jobs, and welcomes the submission from Perth and Kinross 
            Council highlighting the suitability of a number of sites in Perthshire.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John Swinney<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2670</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Asylum Policy of Austrialian 
            Government</strong>-That the Parliament condemns the Australian Government 
            for its inhumane asylum policy which has led directly to over 300 
            desperate and imprisoned asylum seekers embarking on hunger strikes 
            to highlight their case for asylum and their appalling treatment by 
            the Australian Government; finds this inhumane treatment particularly 
            offensive having recently witnessed Holocaust memorial services across 
            Scotland; regards it as a shameful fact of history that, had those 
            seeking asylum from Nazi Germany been allowed into neighbouring countries, 
            many lives could have been saved, and therefore urges the Scottish 
            Executive to make representations to the Australian Government to 
            register our opposition to its asylum policy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2669#</strong> <strong>Elaine Thomson: World Heritage Site Status for 
            the Cairngorms</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the United Nations 
            on its co-ordination of the International Year of Mountains; believes 
            that an appropriate way to celebrate the year would be to ensure that 
            the Cairngorm Mountain Range, the largest continuous area of high 
            ground above 1,000 metres in Britain, is designated a World Heritage 
            Site, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should speedily 
            propose discussions with Her Majesty's Government to achieve the ultimate 
            international acclaim of World Heritage Status for this beautiful 
            and environmentally unique part of our heritage.</p>
