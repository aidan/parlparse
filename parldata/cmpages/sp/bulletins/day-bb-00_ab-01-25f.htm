    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-458#</b> <strong>Elaine Smith: Methadone Programme</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament expresses its condolences and sympathy for the family and friends of
    15-year-old Kerry Ann Kirk from Coatbridge who died in a tragic drugs related incident
    over the Christmas period; welcomes the announcement by the Deputy Minister for Justice
    that tightened controls on prescribing practices for methadone drug treatment programmes
    are to be introduced, and hopes that tragic circumstances such as those surrounding Kerry
    Ann&#146;s death can be prevented from recurring.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-457</b> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Scottish Flight Supplements</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the outrageous flight supplements charged on holiday flights from
    Scotland; acknowledges that there is no justification for the supplements currently
    administered on Scottish flights; and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make
    representations to Her Majesty&#146;s Government in support of an Office of Fair Trading
    inquiry into the level of supplements charged on Scottish holiday flights.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-456#</b> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Car Park Charges</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes with grave concern the proposals by West Lothian Healthcare NHS Trust to
    charge for car parking at St John&#146;s Hospital in Livingston as a method of funding
    essential local NHS services; recognises the difficulties this will cause for patients,
    staff and visitors and calls upon the Trust to meet urgently with the Executive and West
    Lothian Council to resolve this matter.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Ms Margo MacDonald<strong>*</strong>,
    Kay Ullrich<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-455</b> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell: Budget (Scotland) Bill</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Budget (Scotland) Bill.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-454</b> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Duty on Cigars</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes the threat posed to the future of Scotland&#146;s specialist tobacco
    retailers by the declining sales of large cigars, which have fallen 64% over the past
    decade and are still declining; acknowledges that UK duty on cigars is the highest in
    Europe, and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to give consideration to replacing the
    present weight related duty on cigars by duty on a specific per unit basis, which would
    simplify the calculation and collection of tax duty, and could increase revenue overall as
    a result of the potential reduction in personal imports and illegal trafficking.</p>
