          <p><strong> * S2M-2952</strong> <strong>Frances Curran: Don&rsquo;t Let G8 Turn Scotland into a Dictatorship</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that, when the powerful and wealthy prevent those without power from protesting, we have a dictatorship; notes that the G8 is made up of the most powerful countries in the world and that their leaders, who will be meeting at Gleneagles, are the same people who enforce economic policies which result in mass poverty in developing countries and that the group includes countries which have bombed two countries, killing 100,000 people; believes that it is &ldquo;make your mind up time&rdquo; for MSPs and the First Minister about who is in charge of our streets, whether it is Scotland&rsquo;s democratically elected Parliament or the powerful men of the G8, and reiterates its support for the right to protest at Gleneagles. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2951# Christine Grahame: W8 Summit</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the W8 Conference taking place in Edinburgh on 23 June 2005, where eight African women will address the conference; believes that these eight women could change the face of Africa if given some of the support and decision-making power of the G8 leaders meeting at Gleneagles, and notes that these woman have all made significant contributions across Africa and that their voices need to be heard so that practical solutions at grass roots level are not overlooked among welcome, but often remote, international diplomacy. </p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2950</strong> R<strong>osie Kane: Clean Law</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the evidence in the report, <em>Investigating Environmental Justice in Scotland: Links Between Measures of Environmental Quality and Social Deprivation</em>, that highlights that the poor are more likely to live in an environmentally deprived area than those in less socially deprived areas; recognises that this endangers the physical, mental and emotional health of us all; further recognises that the current level of environmental degradation is unsustainable and detrimental to the entire planet, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward a clean law whereby every citizen in Scotland lives in an environment with clean land, clean air and clean water.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2949</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell: The Big Ask for Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the &ldquo;Big Ask&rdquo; initiative by Friends of the Earth which calls for legislation to ensure that the UK Government is legally responsible for reducing greenhouse gas pollution that contributes to climate change; notes that the proposed legislation would require a 3% year-on-year reduction in climate change gas emissions which would meet an overall target of reducing emissions by 80% of 1990 levels by 2050; notes the Parliament&rsquo;s Environment and Rural Development Committee inquiry report into climate change which concluded that &ldquo;the current rate of progress in reducing emissions in Scotland is inadequate to meet both short and long-term targets&rdquo; and &ldquo;that very substantial action must begin now&rdquo;; further notes the Committee&rsquo;s conclusion that &ldquo;A massive possibility for change exists at government, business and individual levels, given the right policy levers and leadership.&rdquo;; recognises that the Scottish Executive has powers over climate change gas emissions in areas such as energy efficiency, including building regulations, renewable energy, transport, land use, including agriculture and forestry, and procurement, and therefore believes that similar legislation, setting targets for reducing climate change gas pollution, should be considered for Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2948 Rosie Kane: Nitrogen Dioxide Levels in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s failure to produce an air safety plan for Glasgow in respect of nitrogen dioxide levels, as requested by the European Commission; further condemns the Executive&rsquo;s lack of willingness to address this issue despite the grave health risks associated with nitrogen dioxide levels, especially to those with asthma and other respiratory conditions; calls on both the Executive and Glasgow City Council to publish what plans they do have on this issue, and further calls on the Executive and Glasgow City Council to undertake a city-wide clean up of the air as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2947 Patrick Harvie: Glasgow Air Safety Plan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s failure to submit a detailed air safety plan for Glasgow to the European Commission, despite the deadline for this submission passing more than a year ago; notes that the Executive and the UK Government may now face significant fines for ignoring the European Commission&rsquo;s demand for a detailed air safety plan; notes that levels of PM10 pollution in Glasgow exceed government safety limits; is concerned that Glasgow has the worst record in the United Kingdom in terms of growth in air pollution; finds it unacceptable that in one part of the city levels of air pollution have actually soared by more than 25%, despite the introduction of an Air Quality Action Plan by Glasgow City Council; believes that the council must introduce stronger traffic reduction measures and radically improve public transport in Glasgow so as not to continue endangering the health of Glaswegians, and calls on the Executive to explain why it missed the deadline for the submission of an air safety action plan to the European Commission, to commit to a timescale for submitting the plan and to state how much this is expected to cost the taxpayer if fines are sought by the Commission.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2946 Chris Ballance: Airline Tax for Africa Aid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the rejection by the Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs of the French and German initiatives to raise money for Africa through introducing an international tax on aviation fuel; notes that the aviation industry enjoys tax breaks which give it unfair economic advantage over more sustainable forms of transport, equivalent to a subsidy of over &pound;9 billion per year in the United Kingdom alone; agrees that the problems of Africa also require political solutions; notes, however, the hypocrisy and inconsistency of these MPs in calling for climate change action and aid for Africa whilst objecting to this very worthwhile proposal, and further notes that, where vital air links such as those to some Scottish islands are identified, these could easily continue to receive subsidies to ensure that remote communities are not disproportionately affected by this necessary and urgently required tax.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2940 Mark Ballard: Exploitation in the TV Industry</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the efforts of the Television Workforce Rights Advocacy Petition (TV Wrap) campaign in drawing attention to the plight of television workers; is gravely concerned about the systematic abuses of employment rights in the television industry; notes that many people working in the television industry work extremely long hours while earning considerably less than the minimum wage; condemns the culture of fear that prevails in the television industry which effectively prevents employees from speaking out against the routine exploitation of workers, and calls on employers in the media sector to develop a culture in which all workers are properly valued and respected.</p>
          <p> <strong>S2M-2938 Mike Watson: Parliament Welcomes Jobs Fair in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at figures published by the Scottish Executive which show that only 48% of non-whites in Scotland are currently in full-time employment compared with 71% of whites in full-time employment and, in particular, the fact that there are less than half the number of non-white women in work than there are white women in work; notes that a recent survey by the Race Equality in Housing Forum revealed that black and minority ethnic employees accounted for just 0.8% of staff working for registered social landlords, but that that was twice the percentage for local authority employees; acknowledges the urgent need to improve these figures, and therefore welcomes the job fair specifically for Scotland&rsquo;s black and minority ethnic population organised by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, the Chartered Institute of Housing and Hanover (Scotland), Bield and Trust Housing Associations taking place in Glasgow on 11 June 2005.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2936 # Dennis Canavan: Location of Mental Welfare Commission</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the decision by the Mental Welfare Commission to overturn the proposal to relocate to Falkirk; believes that further consideration should be given to the matter; notes that Falkirk&rsquo;s central situation and excellent transport links make it an ideal place for relocation, and believes that the Scottish Executive should give top priority to Falkirk in future relocation plans.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2934 Shiona Baird: Raw Sewage Discharges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores plans by Scottish Water to discharge minimally screened sewage directly into the North Sea at Haugh&rsquo;s Bay as part of a new &pound;3.5 million waste water system for the Mearns coastal villages of Johnshaven, Gourdon, Inverbervie and St. Cyrus; expresses concern that the proposed preliminary treatment scheme, which involves screening for only non-biodegradable solids as opposed to primary or secondary treatment, falls far short of acceptable standards and will not meet stringent new European guidelines which are due to take effect from December 2005; believes that a comprehensive environmental impact assessment, hydrodynamic survey and a comprehensive marine scientific survey should be conducted in respect of the project, which should proceed only if a more effective screening and treatment process is put in place so that public health, wellbeing, the fishing industry, the local economy and the unique environment and enviable amenities are not compromised; calls on the Scottish Executive to redesignate these coastal waters as shellfish waters or apply equally stringent water classifications as a matter of priority, and supports local residents in their campaign to secure upgraded sewage treatment facilities which represent best value and are fit for purpose in 21st century Scotland.</p>
