Parliament</STRONG></P><DIR> <P>9:30 am&#9;Debate on Broadcasting and Media in 
Scotland&#151; </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3507</STRONG> <STRONG>Michael Russell:</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Broadcasting and the Media</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
the vital importance of broadcasting and the print media to the cultural, social 
and economic life of Scotland and expresses its concern that the present devolution 
settlement prevents it from legislating in order to secure diversity of ownership 
and appropriate modern broadcasting regulation in Scotland</P><DIR> <DIR> <P>The 
Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3507.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mike Watson: Broadcasting and the Media</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment 
to motion (S1M-3507) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from &quot;and 
expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;; recognises the importance to Scotland 
of UK, Scottish and regional television programming and production; believes that 
these interests are enhanced by diversity in media ownership, and believes that 
it is vital that the relevant regulatory bodies reflect those Scottish interests 
in respect of UK broadcasting regulations and other media matters.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3507.2</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith: Broadcasting and the Media</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment 
to motion (S1M-3507) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from &quot;and 
expresses&quot; to end and insert &quot;; believes that the public interest is 
best protected by maximising competition and liberalising the current strict laws 
that apply to the media; supports the principle that such matters are dealt with 
at a UK level but considers that the current regulatory structure is detrimental 
to the growth and prosperity of the sector, and supports the right of broadcasters 
and publishers to make their own commercial decisions with the minimum possible 
interference from the state.</P></DIR></DIR><P><em>followed by</em>&#9;Debate on 
Fishing&#151; </P><P><STRONG>S1M-3511</STRONG> <STRONG>Richard Lochhead:</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Fishing</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that sustainable 
fisheries are essential for the well-being of our fishing communities but rejects 
any advice to close Scotland&#146;s mixed fishery as part of a cod recovery plan 
given the devastating and unjustifiable impact that such a measure would have 
on our fishing communities and associated sectors; calls on the Scottish Executive 
to work in partnership with the fishing industry with a view to drawing up proposals 
for the future management of all fish stocks; notes that technical conservation 
measures and the recent decommissioning scheme have not been fully taken into 
account; further notes that other states that fish Scottish waters, or impact 
on local stocks, have a duty to adopt similar measures including a reduction in 
the industrial fishery, and believes that any further measures, for which the 
necessary funding should be made available, should be delayed given that they 
would be most effectively generated through the new mechanisms proposed as part 
of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy that will be adopted in a matter of weeks 
and that Scotland should seek to officially lead the UK delegation during forthcoming 
European negotiations on which the future of the fishing industry depends.</P><DIR> 
<DIR> <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3511.2</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Ross Finnie: Fishing</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3511) 
in the name of Richard Lochhead, <A NAME="AmendmentText">leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;rejects the wholesale closure of Scottish fishing grounds 
as politically unacceptable and economically ruinous for Scotland&#146;s fishing 
communities; welcomes the fact that the Scottish Executive is working in close 
collaboration with the Scottish fishing industry to identify alternative approaches, 
and urges all concerned to pursue a longer-term strategy that will reverse the 
historic decline in key fish stocks and secure a sustainable basis for our fisheries-dependent 
communities.&quot;</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3511.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr Jamie McGrigor: 
Fishing</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3511) in the name of Richard 
Lochhead, leave out from &quot;and believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;regrets 
that this latest crisis comes on the back of the announcement that Scotland is 
to receive only 2% of the total allowable catch for deep water species on the 
west coast of Scotland, and believes that we need to restore national and local 
control and management of our waters to ensure sensible conservation measures 
and to protect the interests of Scotland&#146;s fishermen.&quot;</P></DIR></DIR><P>2:30
