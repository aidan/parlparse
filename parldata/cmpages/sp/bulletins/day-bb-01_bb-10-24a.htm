                        the Parliament notes with concern the continuing difficulties 
                        disabled citizens experience in accessing railway station 
                        platforms and the adverse impact this has on their freedom 
                        to travel; notes in particular the difficulties with access 
                        to and from the southbound platform of Lockerbie station, 
                        the only mainline station in south-west Scotland, which 
                        means disabled passengers have to travel south to Carlisle 
                        and return north on another train in order to be able 
                        to leave the station premises, and believes that the Scottish 
                        Executive should do all it can to work with Railtrack, 
                        train operating companies and any other relevant bodies 
                        to ensure that the necessary funding is available and 
                        priority given to providing appropriate disabled access 
                        to railway station platforms in Scotland and Lockerbie 
                        in particular. </p>
