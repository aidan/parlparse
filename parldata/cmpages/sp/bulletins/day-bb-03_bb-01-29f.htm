          <p> <strong>*S1M-3821#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Crime in the 
            North East</strong>-That the Parliament expresses concern over the 
            level of crime in Grampian; believes that this is largely linked to 
            substance misuse; recognises that substance misuse and consequent 
            crime affect<strike>s</strike> both urban and rural communities in 
            the region; notes that Aberdeen has the highest level of break-ins 
            of any local authority area in Scotland and the second highest level 
            of overall crime; notes that Grampian has the highest level of crimes 
            of dishonesty in Scotland; believes that the situation is not helped 
            by the historical under-funding of Grampian Police which has one of 
            the lowest levels of funding in Scotland and the lowest level of police 
            officers per head of population; further believes that the situation 
            is exacerbated by the length of time that drug misusers must wait 
            for treatment from local services, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should investigate the level of crime in Grampian and take 
            the necessary steps to tackle the causes.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3820#</strong> <strong>Dr Richard Simpson: New Forth 
            Road Bridge Crossing Near Kincardine</strong>-That the Parliament 
            welcomes the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with the 
            new Forth road bridge crossing upstream from the Kincardine Bridge; 
            notes the decision by the Forth Valley NHS Board to recommend to the 
            Scottish Executive that there should be a new single site acute hospital 
            and that the favoured site should be at the Royal Scottish National 
            Hospital, Larbert; recognises the very real difficulties in access 
            to the proposed site for patients from Clackmannanshire, West Fife 
            and Stirling, and considers that the Scottish Executive should do 
            all in its power to ensure that the bridge is completed as soon as 
            possible and that, in considering any site for the new hospital, the 
            road networks will provide equity of access to all residents in Forth 
            Valley. </p>

          <p><strong>*S1M-3819</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Statement by the 
            Deputy Prime Minister on the Fire Service</strong>-That the Parliament 
            condemns the dictatorial attempt by the Deputy Prime Minister to impose 
            a new national settlement on the firefighters; believes that this 
            is a prelude to cutting the numbers of firefighters, fire stations 
            and level of fire cover and is a threat to the people of Scotland 
            and the UK as a whole, and demands that the Scottish Executive resists 
            these attempts and continues the normal process of negotiations and 
            agreement with trade unions.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3818</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Transforming Public 
            Finance for Social Justice, Regeneration and the Environment</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes recent studies by the Scottish Executive and 
            is interested in building on them by considering and investigating 
            the contribution that land value taxation could make to the cultural, 
            economic, environmental and democratic renaissance of Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3817 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Designation of Lead Committee</strong>-That the Parliament

            in consideration of the Police and Police (Special Constables) (Scotland) 
            Amendment Regulations 2003 (SSI 2003/21). </p>

            the meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, Switzerland, 
            on 23 to 27 January 2003; notes that the WEF is a meeting of business 
            leaders and politicians to discuss world social and economic policy; 
            notes that previous meetings of the WEF have seen promises from chief 
            executives of multinational corporations about their aspirations to 
            achieve social and environmental responsibility; believes that voluntary 
            action by corporations on environment and social issues is not delivering 
            sustainability, and therefore urges the Secretary of State for Trade 
            and Industry to propose binding rules on corporations in order that 
            they can be held accountable for their environmental and social impacts.</p>
