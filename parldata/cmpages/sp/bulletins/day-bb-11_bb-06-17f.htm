<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00342 Johann Lamont: Congratulations to Pollok Children&rsquo;s Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Pollok Children&rsquo;s Centre on its 25th anniversary; celebrates the important work done by all those involved over the last quarter of a century in caring for and educating the many youngsters who have attended the centre; believes that the start given to these children in their pre-school years helps them immensely in achieving their potential, and confirms the importance of funding properly these centres, which provide so much to young people and their families.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00341 Rob Gibson: Neil Gunn Prizes 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all the winners and runners-up, participants and organisers of the biennial Neil Gunn Writing Competition; notes with appreciation the strong showing from Caithness, the home county of Neil Gunn, where Sarah Sinclair of Lybster Primary School won the first prize in the primary section, with Mari-Ann Ganson, also from Lybster, taking second place and Donald Mackay of Watten winning joint first in the adult poetry section; recognises the breadth of interest in this competition, which attracted entrants from as far afield as Portugal, South Africa and Australia, showing the world impact that the writing of Caithness&rsquo;s Neil Gunn has had; wishes the organisers all the best for the next competition, due to take place in 2012-13, and contends that, on this showing, creative writing in the Highlands remains strong.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00340 Sandra White: Glasgow Mela 2011</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the return of Glasgow&rsquo;s biggest multicultural festival, the Glasgow Mela 2011, which this year celebrates its 21st anniversary and runs on 18 and 19 July; believes that this colourful celebration of multiculturalism and diversity is a great reflection of the fabric and make-up of a modern, vibrant and inclusive Glasgow, and congratulates the hard work and dedication of all those who have contributed to making the Glasgow Mela a truly stunning success.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00339 Humza Yousaf: Diabetes Live for it! Choices for Change Launch</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the launch of Live for it! Choices for Change, a new programme of workshops and activities designed to help schoolchildren make healthy lifestyle choices; recognises that one in three children are overweight or obese and this not only has an impact on their health now, but can lead to further problems in later life including the development of type 2 diabetes; congratulates the organisers of Live for it!, Diabetes UK Scotland and the Edinburgh International Science Festival on what it considers such an imaginative partnership in tackling obesity and promoting healthy living; understands that Scotland has one of the highest rates of type 1 diabetes in the world and that the programme also helps to raise awareness of this type of diabetes, and welcomes the opportunity to learn more about the programme when Diabetes UK Scotland brings Live for it! to the Parliament on 29 and 30 June 2011.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00338 Jim Hume: City Status for Dumfries</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the Queen&rsquo;s diamond jubilee civic honours competition to mark Her Majesty&rsquo;s 60-year reign; understands that this will take the form of a competition between competing towns to be awarded city status in 2012; further understands that 26 contenders have been submitted to receive the honour and that only one will be successful; notes that one of the contenders is Dumfries in the south of Scotland region; considers Dumfries to be an appropriate choice for city status as a market town and former royal burgh with a population significantly greater than Scotland&rsquo;s newest city when such status was conferred on it in the last such competition, and wishes Dumfries success in its attempt to become Scotland&rsquo;s most southern city.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00328 Richard Simpson: Kinship Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>Spotlight on Kinship Care</em>, by the children&rsquo;s charity, Buttle UK, and the University of Bristol; understands that this is the first study to quantify the number of children being looked after by a relative in the United Kingdom; considers that, by looking at this analysis, which is based on census data from 2001, when 2011 census data become available in 2013, policymakers will, for the first time, be able to measure growth in informal and formal kinship care and any changing patterns that have emerged; understands that the Parliament&rsquo;s reports on kinship care were not informed by these figures so kinship policy was created without this information; further understands that, even in 2001, the number of children in kinship care was much greater than Scottish Government estimates and that while many kinship families were poor, those in Scotland were the poorest; considers that this analysis shines a light for the first time on what is considered an invisible section of people who play a critical role in child protection and raising a generation of children with little support, financial or otherwise; considers that this study shows for the first time the level of poverty and disadvantage in kinship families; believes that the number of children affected will be significantly higher partly due to increasing levels of problem parental drug and alcohol abuse and legislation that encourages the placement of children with relatives; considers that society should be grateful to these carers, and congratulates Buttle UK and the University of Bristol for helping to highlight informal kinship carers as a specific group that should inform future policymaking.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00327 John Mason: A United Approach to Tackling Child Poverty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that no child in Scotland should be born without a chance; recognises that child poverty represents what it considers to be a major barrier to around 200,000 children in Scotland from fulfilling their potential; believes that poverty can kill childhood and that the existence of child poverty in a rich country such as Scotland is morally wrong; further understands that child poverty harms the social and economic fabric of the nation; reaffirms the commitments set out in the Child Poverty Act 2010 of eradicating child poverty by 2020 and to tackle socioeconomic disadvantage in Scotland; commends the efforts of Save the Children in Scotland to raise awareness of child poverty and to tackle its root causes; welcomes the child poverty strategy and considers this to be as an important step in prioritising action; further recognises that the strategy must be backed with adequate resources and political will if it is to be successful; believes that ending child poverty must be a priority for this parliamentary session, and calls on all parties to work together, and in partnership with wider Scottish civil society, to banish child poverty from this country once and for all.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00315.1 Alex Fergusson: Protecting the Wages of Agricultural Workers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion S4M-00315 in the name of Kenneth Gibson (Protecting the Wages of Agricultural Workers), leave out from &quot;calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the agricultural sector is unique in having to contend with the additional layer of employment regulation imposed by the board; recognises the need for appropriate pay and conditions in the sector but considers that such regulation is wholly unnecessary in light of the existing minimum wage; further considers that the existence of the board is in fact serving to undermine the competitiveness of agriculture in Scotland and therefore its ability to generate jobs compared to elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and calls on the Scottish Government to abolish the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board.&quot;</p>
