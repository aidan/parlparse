    <blockquote>
      <b><p ALIGN="left">S1M-172</b> <strong>Mr Alex Salmond: Education</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
      notes the overwhelming rejection of CoSLA&#146;s pay and conditions offer (dated 20 August
      1999) by Scotland&#146;s teachers, recognises the validity of the concerns expressed by
      the teaching profession and parents&#146; representatives about the details of
      CoSLA&#146;s offer and agrees that the implementation of the offer in its current form
      would have resulted in a deterioration of standards in our classrooms and a further
      decline in teachers&#146; morale; considers that the defects in CoSLA&#146;s offer are the
      result of a lack of resources and that the current impasse between CoSLA and the teaching
      profession is a direct result of the failure of the Scottish Executive to make sufficient
      resources available to local government to fund an acceptable settlement and further
      considers that the approach adopted by the Scottish Executive on this issue has been
      delibarately provocative to Scotland&#146;s teachers; and calls upon the Scottish
      Executive to adopt a genuine partnership approach to reaching a settlement with teachers,
      to abandon its proposals to remove the statutory basis of the Scottish Joint Negotiating
      Committee and establish a Committee of Inquiry, and to refer the findings of the
      Millennium Review ( a joint inquiry established by COSLA and teachers&#146; unions in 1997
      to look at various issues in education) for investigation by the Parliament&#146;s
      Education, Culture &amp; Sport Committee.</p>

        welcomes the provision of substantial new resources for education including an additional
        £51m for school education identified in the Partnership Agreement; agrees that the

        Executive&#146;s commitment to a programme of continuous professional development to
        assist teachers in maintaining and improving professional standards; agrees that the
        Scottish Joint Negotiation Committee machinery has failed Scottish teachers, pupils and
        parents, and calls upon the Executive to continue work towards its objective of ensuring a
        modern, adaptive and flexible mechanism for determining the professional conditions of
