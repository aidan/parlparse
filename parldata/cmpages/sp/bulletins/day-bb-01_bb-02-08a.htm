            Energy—</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>S1M-1634</strong> <strong>Robin 

            Harper:</strong> <strong>Renewable Energy</strong>—That the Parliament recognises 

            that (a) Scotland’s renewable energy resources have been recorded 

            as being the best in Europe; (b) there is significant potential for 

            creating employment, both through generating renewable energy and 

            from the manufacture of renewable energy generating plant; (c) community 

            based renewable energy projects would benefit rural development in 

            particular; (d) renewable energy can replace fossil fuels and nuclear 

            energy, therefore contributing to a reduction in climate change impacts 

            from greenhouse gas emissions and a reduction in the accumulation 

            of highly radioactive nuclear waste, and (e) there are certain barriers 

            to the development of Scotland’s renewable energy potential and these 

            barriers must be rapidly surmounted if Scotland is to capitalise on 

            the potential for job creation and environmental protection and therefore 

            calls on the Scottish Executive to (i) set an aspirational target 

            for supply of electricity from renewable sources of at least 22% in 

            line with the recently announced European Union target; (ii) set a 

            further aspirational target for renewable heat generating technologies 

            and fuels such as biomass and solar thermal energy; (iii) establish 

            a Scottish Wave Energy Test Site; (iv) ensure that, under the forthcoming 

            Renewables Obligation Scotland (ROS) scheme, the generation of energy 

            from the incineration of municipal waste does not qualify for support; 

            (v) ensure under ROS that small scale hydroelectricity generation 

            and refurbishment does qualify for support; (vi) ensure under ROS 

            that there is a market for wave energy; (vii) ensure under ROS that 

            Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) may be issued in multiples 

            of as low as one kilowatt hour in order to facilitate the granting 

            of ROCs for domestic scale renewables and auto-generation and that 

            ROCs are fully tradable across the border with England, and (viii) 

            urgently establish a new cross-cutting team within the Scottish Executive 

            drawing on the resources of the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong 

            Learning and the Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture whose 

            first goal will be to set up a Renewable Energy Working Group headed 

            by a new Commissioner for Renewable Energy and whose remit will be 

            to pursue actively the development of renewable energy in Scotland.

            remain unequivocal that, on the scientific evidence available, there 

            is no casual link between MMR vaccine and autism; further notes that 

            there is in progress a major study funded by the Medical Research 

            Council into the causes of autism, and agrees that, in the best interests

            Parliament notes the introduction of capital receipt set aside rules 

            by the previous Tory government in April 1996, diverting significant 

            resources from council expenditure across Scotland; further notes 

            the universal opposition of Labour MPs, councillors and CoSLA to these 

            set aside rules when they were introduced; also notes that since financial 

            year 1997-98 a total of £641 million has been diverted from investment 

            in council housing stock and from 1999-2000 to 2000-01 a total of 

            £315,536,000 has been lost from council housing budgets; finally notes 

            that the sum lost from council housing budgets since 1999 could have 

            delivered 126,214 households with whole-house central heating and 

            insulation and/or double-glazed window units, and therefore agrees 

            to rescind the capital receipt set aside rules with immediate effect,

            ownership initiative as a means of lifting the debt burden from tenants, 

            securing a step change in investment and putting tenants at the heart 

            of rebuilding communities, and also welcomes the Executive’s commitment

            attack on public investment in housing that began under the Conservatives 

            and has been continued by the present UK Government and Scottish Executive; 

            regrets that the Labour Government and this Labour/Liberal administration 

            have continued this Conservative policy, and calls upon the Scottish 

            Executive to rescind the capital receipt set aside rules with immediate 

            effect and so inject much needed funding into Scotland’s public sector 

            housing.&quot; </font></p>

            Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Abolition of Council Tax</strong>—That the Parliament 

            believes that the council tax is a fundamentally unfair and regressive 

            tax; believes in social justice and the redistribution of wealth from 

            the rich to the poor; therefore agrees to abolish the council tax 

            and replace it with the Scottish Service Tax which is based on an 

            individual’s income and is inherently fairer, more efficient and redistributive; 

            notes that the Scottish Service Tax would raise more revenue than 

            the council tax and that it would remove the burden of paying for 

            local government jobs and services from the shoulders of low paid 

            workers and pensioners and place it firmly on the shoulders of the 

            well paid and the wealthy, and believes that the introduction of the 

            Scottish Service Tax should be complemented by the return of the right 

            for local authorities to raise and retain their business rates and 

            a thorough investigation of land value and speculation taxes to supplement 

            local authority revenue. </font></p>
