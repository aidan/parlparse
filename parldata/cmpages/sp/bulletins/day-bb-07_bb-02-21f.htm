<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5618</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Bus Connectivity in Scotland and the Competition Commission</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates all those organisations and individuals across Scotland involved in the efforts to ensure that the bus services grow into a co-ordinated, responsive service meeting the demands of an integrated public transport service; expresses profound concern that the Competition Commission has made a determination requiring divestment of the Megabus or Stagecoach services currently operated as a joint venture, created on 12 September 2005, to operate the Scottish services of Stagecoach&rsquo;s megabus.com and Motorvator and Braddell plc&rsquo;s Scottish Citylink; observes that Stagecoach acquired 35% of the share capital of Scottish Citylink Limited in return for transferring certain rights to the Motorvator and megabus.com operations in Scotland; notes that Braddell plc owns the remaining 65% of Citylink&rsquo;s share capital with the joint venture operating services under the megabus.com and Scottish Citylink brands, and is the leading provider of express coach services in Scotland; welcomes the fact that passenger numbers have risen year on year by 41% and notes that, after stripping out the impact of the concession scheme, growth is in the region of 25%; is disturbed that the commission&rsquo;s plans may dismantle a high-quality, value-for-money and integrated network and replace it with a disintegrated collection of routes to the detriment of customers who rely on lifeline inter-city coach services; is concerned at the cost to the taxpayer of further inquiry and regrets that the issue is now presenting serious conflict in Scottish Executive transport policy; hopes that the Executive will make representations to the Competition Commission to seek a reversal of its decision that will seriously impact on the major efforts that are being made by relevant people and organisations in Scotland to produce bus services fit for the 21st century, and finally hopes that for all sectors where monopoly power is subject of Competition Commission rulings there will be equitable and fair treatment across all sectors.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5617</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> <strong>Affordable Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the importance that the Scottish Executive has placed on ensuring the provision of affordable housing across Scotland; notes the significant investment of &pound;1.2 billion that is delivering 21,500 new affordable homes and the success of the innovative shared equity scheme, Homestake; welcomes the additional steps that have been taken to increase the proportion of affordable homes within new housing developments, and notes the intention of the Executive to ensure that affordable houses are also sustainable houses.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5616</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the National Westminster Bank, Powergen, the AA, Esure and SAGA</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates and commends the National Westminster Bank which now guarantees that its customers will speak to call centre staff in Barnsley or Cardiff rather than to an overseas call point; further notes that in recent months a number of big British organisations have announced that they are bringing call centres back to the United Kingdom, including Powergen and the AA, with the Executive Chairman of Esure, Peter Wood, reportedly suggesting that the trend for outsourcing is doomed as companies in the UK are recognising that the front-line agents of their companies need to provide quality, not quantity, of calls answered; particularly congratulates companies such as Saga, an insurance and over-50s holiday company, that have stuck to a policy of keeping their business operations in the UK, and finally, on behalf of the people of Scotland, hopes that all businesses and public agencies in Scotland will review their call centre operations and address another area of serious customer frustration, namely that they make a clear commitment that every customer or caller has the option of being able to speak to a company representative live in the event of press button options failing to address the concern of the caller.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5615</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>They Suffered So That We Might Vote</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commemorates and celebrates the struggles of 14 February 1907, a century ago, when a record number of 57 suffragettes, plus two men, appeared in court following bitter clashes that lasted for more than five hours between the suffragettes and police officers, many on horseback; notes that the battle marked the then most ferocious battle in the women&rsquo;s war for the right to vote; remembers, in particular, Christabel Pankhurst and all the other key personalities who fought for this vital democratic right; pays tribute to our friends in Finland, which became the first European country to give women the right to vote, and notes that, while campaigns waged in Britain and America, Finland saw women from all social classes sworn in as members of the Finnish Parliament; further remembers that Labour&rsquo;s Keir Hardie&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Enfranchisement Bill was defeated on 8 March 1907; commends to every women today in Scotland, young and old, the memory that must not be forgotten of the grim, determined, ferocious struggle that it took for women to have the right to vote; hopes that women across Scotland will celebrate this precious right by making sure that they use their vote in the forthcoming elections, and notes that they also can now apply for a postal vote which enables them to vote easily, minimising any external pressures that might otherwise present barriers to their trip to the polling station.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5614#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Lochgelly Welcomes Fife Women&rsquo;s Technology Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Fife Women&rsquo;s Technology Centre (FWTC) on winning the Scottish Adult Learning Partnership Community Participation Award for Sustainability in Edinburgh on 11 February 2007; further notes that the FWTC learned on 20 February that it has won the Scottish Health at Work Gold Award; warmly welcomes the announcement that Fife Council is enabling the relocation of the FWTC to Lochgelly from the end of 2007, and hopes that the FWTC will continue to go from strength to strength, enabling more young women to graduate to responsible positions in the world of information technology.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5613</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>Double Jeopardy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the criminal law of Scotland be changed so that persons acquitted of serious criminal charges can be tried again if new and compelling evidence comes to light.</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5611</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Keith Bypass</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the need for a Keith bypass; notes that the last Conservative UK Government had made provisions for a bypass for Keith but that these were shamefully dropped by the Lib-Lab pact in 1999; further notes that there are many positive benefits for the local people, the local economy and the environment of a Keith bypass, and calls on the Scottish Executive to include a bypass for Keith in any future investment priorities for the whole transport network in Scotland.</p>
<p>Supported by: Dave Petrie<strong>*</strong>, Alex Johnstone<strong>*</strong>, Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong>, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-5610</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Dancing in the Dark by the Villagers of Steelend</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concerns that Scottish Power is continuing to fail the people of Steelend and nearby villages by failing to address their constant power cuts; is particularly concerned that the outages in Steelend last longer than the power cuts in other nearby villages; further notes that villagers in Steelend were left at Hogmanay to dance in the dark; is explicit in requiring public utilities to provide timely communications, advice and guidance to the public when challenged by emergency situations when vulnerable and frail individuals can be put at risk, and, while appreciating that Bruce Springsteen may have extolled the virtues of dancing in blackness, recognises and supports the folks of Steelend and other villagers across Scotland who resent their welfare being ignored.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5609#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Unfair Annual Railway Season Ticket Charging Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the incredible differential of &pound;304 for an annual season ticket, representing the additional cost to rail passengers travelling from North Queensferry station to South Gyle station who pay &pound;780 per annum, in contrast to annual season ticket holders from Dalmeny to South Gyle who pay &pound;476 per annum; is concerned that this difference may relate to the Forth Bridge crossing between North Queensferry and Dalmeny stations and demands an urgent investigation by Scotrail into this apparent penalty on commuters from North Queensferry; hopes, however, for a much wider review of train fares from Fife to other parts of Scotland in the knowledge that Fifers still pay the highest rail fare per kilometre of any part of Scotland, and hopes that such a review will result in a lowering of rail fares in a bid to ensure that more commuters travel by rail.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5608.1</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Community Safety</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5608) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the concern and anxiety in our communities caused by both low-level antisocial behaviour and serious and violent crime; appreciates the increased burden placed on our police forces by new legislation and additional requirements; believes that the best way of tackling both serious crime and antisocial behaviour is a visible police presence to reassure the public and deter criminals, and therefore commits to the recruitment of 1,000 additional police officers for our communities.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5608.2</strong> <strong>Miss Annabel Goldie:</strong> <strong>Community Safety</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5608) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from &quot;acknowledges&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes, in relation to community safety, that since 1999 crimes and offences are up, that according to the Scottish Crime survey only one in four crimes is reported to the police, that drug crime has increased 5.7% in the last year, that automatic early release of prisoners is not being adequately addressed and that there is a crisis of public confidence in the criminal justice system, and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase police numbers to improve levels of community policing, to bring forward an expansion of drug rehabilitation facilities and to restore clarity and honesty in sentencing in order to improve community safety and rebuild public confidence in our criminal justice system.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5607.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>The Environment</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5607) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the conclusions of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) report that human beings are, with a 90% probability, responsible for accelerating climate change and believes that this report simply reinforces the need for urgent action; therefore welcomes the Conservatives&rsquo; commitment to a climate change Bill to introduce annual targets and their call for carbon capture and storage to be put on an equal footing with other low-carbon energy sources; believes that we need a broad-based strategy of energy production for future energy provision in Scotland, and further welcomes the Scottish Conservatives&rsquo; proposal for a Scottish eco-bonus scheme to incentivise households, communities and small businesses to install modern energy-creating and energy-saving technologies that will have the triple benefit of cutting their energy bills, reducing CO2 emissions and giving a boost to new small-scale renewable technologies.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5607.2</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>The Environment</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5607) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises that developing a sustainable energy policy is one of the most serious environmental challenges currently facing Scotland, given the need to reduce our climate changing emissions; believes that Scotland&rsquo;s energy future is best served by a combination of energy conservation, energy efficiency and clean decentralised production of energy; notes that nuclear power remains an expensive, dangerous and fundamentally unsustainable power source that is by no means carbon-free and that the long-term storage of radioactive waste continues to pose an insurmountable challenge to the nuclear industry; welcomes therefore the success of Greenpeace&rsquo;s judicial review of the UK Government&rsquo;s flawed consultation on nuclear power and hopes that a properly conducted consultation exercise will arrive at a more sustainable outcome; calls on the Scottish Executive to prepare and submit a timely response to the new UK energy review consultation which highlights the environmental, social and economic benefits offered by energy conservation and efficiency and renewable energy in Scotland, and calls on all political parties that oppose nuclear power to publicly rule out coalition with any party that refuses to rule out new nuclear build in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5607.3</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>The Environment</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-5607) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the ruling by the High Court in London regarding the UK Government consultation on energy; notes that the DTI has accepted the judgement and will consult further; believes that the way ahead for energy in Scotland is to deliver on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s energy policies; further welcomes the announcement by the Executive that it has already met its 2010 target of 18% of Scotland&rsquo;s electricity from renewable energy; welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s support for nine marine power projects, including one set to be the world&rsquo;s largest, and its commitment to the world-leading European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney; notes that the achievement of the Executive&rsquo;s renewable energy targets has been through a mix of renewable technologies, including the major Blacklaw windfarm constructed on a former open-cast coal site generating 140MW; notes that projects for the future include the substantial Glen Doe hydro power project, world-leading offshore wind development and significant biomass energy schemes, and believes that Scotland can achieve its future renewables targets if it is supported with determination and consistency by the Executive.&quot;</p>
