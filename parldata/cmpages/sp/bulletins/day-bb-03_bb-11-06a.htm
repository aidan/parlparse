                        <strong>Wind Farms</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
                        with concern the proliferation of planning applications 
                        for onshore wind farms throughout Scotland; is further 
                        concerned, whilst supporting renewable energy, about the 
                        environmental and landscape impact of wind farms and understands 
                        that these frequently face vigorous local opposition; 
                        believes that the current planning regime provides inadequate 
                        guidance to local authorities, communities and developers 
                        in relation to the siting of wind farms; considers that 
                        the Scottish Executive should bring forward as a matter 
                        of urgency new planning guidance on the siting of wind 
                        farms taking proper account of these factors, and further 
                        considers that the Executive should declare a moratorium 
                        on the determination of locally-opposed wind farm planning 
                        applications until such guidance has taken effect.</P>
